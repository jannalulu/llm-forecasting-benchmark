Branson reminded readers of the historical agreement from 1994, in which Russia promised to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, and borders in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons. However, Russia has consistently violated this agreement, starting with its illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and culminating in Putin's attack on Ukraine in 2022. Branson argues that without the Budapest Memorandum, Russia would have been free to absorb as much Ukrainian territory as it wanted, ignoring its promise to the Ukrainian people and the world. He also questions whether any country with nuclear weapons would ever agree to give them up again, and whether any country without nuclear weapons would seek to acquire them as a deterrent. Branson concludes that if we cannot rely on such agreements when relations between countries deteriorate, what other options are left for the world before it descends into anarchy or worse?\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 22, 2024 08:30 PM\nSource:[hvylya.net](https://hvylya.net/news/303005-richard-brenson-napomnil-miru-o-narushenii-rossiey-budapeshtskogo-memoranduma)\n\n**Blue Origin Successfully Launches New Shepard with Six Aboard**\nBlue Origin successfully launched its suborbital spaceflight New Shepard on November 22, carrying six people to space, including two repeat customers and a science communicator. The rocket New Shepard launched from Launch Site One in West Texas at 10:30 AM EST without any delays, which were common in previous launches. The capsule New Shepard RSS First Step, which made its 11th flight, landed about 10 minutes after launch and 2.5 minutes after the booster landed. The NS-28 crew consisted of six people, including Mark and Sharon Hagle, who flew on mission NS-20 in March 2022. Also on board was Emily Calandrelli, an author, TV host, and science communicator, who said in a social media post that she will become the 100th woman to fly in space. However, this number includes nine women who flew on suborbital flights with Virgin Galactic, which reached an altitude of 80.5 km but did not cross the 100 km Karman line used by Blue Origin as the boundary of space. Blue Origin did not mention this milestone in their live broadcast of the launch, discussing Calandrelli. The other three crew members were Austin Littrell, a risk management professional in the financial industry who won his spot through an online platform, James Russell, a technology entrepreneur; and Henry Winkler, chairman and CEO of Bayshore Capital, a Canadian investment company. NS-28 was the ninth crewed flight of New Shepard and the third this year. It was also the second flight in a month after the October 23 uncrewed launch of NS-27, which was the first flight of the new crew capsule and booster that Blue Origin plans to use for future crewed flights to provide 'expanded capabilities to meet growing customer demand,' the company said at the time.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 22, 2024 05:18 PM\nSource:[iXBT.com](https://www.ixbt.com/news/2024/11/22/22-blue-origin-new-shepard.html)\n\n**China's a long way from reaching this year's space launch target**\nChina is struggling to meet its ambitious goal of 100 space launches in 2024, with nearly half of the planned missions yet to take place. According to a Beijing-based rocket engineer, 'It was never possible to complete that many [launches] in the first place.' The engineer, who previously worked for a state-owned space launch vehicle manufacturer, attributed China's struggles to insufficient funding, a shortage of talent, and limited government support. Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer and space historian at Harvard University, noted that rocket reusability was a major factor in the United States' lead over China in space launches.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 22, 2024 06:00 AM\nSource:[South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3287632/chinas-long-way-reaching-years-space-launch-target)\n\n**Blue Origin targeting Nov. 22 for next space tourism launch**\nBlue Origin is targeting November 22 for its next space tourism launch, NS-28, which will send six people, including 'Space Gal' Emily Calandrelli, to suborbital space. The crew will experience weightlessness and views of Earth against the blackness of space for a few minutes. This will be the ninth crewed mission for Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket-capsule combo, which will lift off from the company's West Texas spaceport at 10:30 a.m. EST. The event will be live-streamed on Space.com and Blue Origin's website.

The company's cash burn rate accelerated to $118 million in the quarter, but it has $744 million in cash and equivalents, which would last for another six quarters. However, management expects cash burn to rise, and the company plans to issue and sell another $300 million worth of stock to build new spaceplanes and pay for general corporate purposes. This will dilute existing shareholders by 150% and reduce their ownership stake in future profits. The author of the article recommends selling Virgin Galactic stock, citing the company's lack of profitability and the risks associated with the space tourism industry.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2024 11:36 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/11/18/virgin-galactic-needs-more-money/)\n\n**Shocking News (But No, Not Really): Virgin Galactic Needs More Money**\nVirgin Galactic announced its third-quarter earnings, with mixed results. On the one hand, the company is making progress on its new Delta-class spaceplanes and motherships, with commercial flights expected to begin in 2026. However, the company collected almost no revenue this quarter ($402,000) and lost $72.7 million, with a cash burn rate of $118 million. Despite having $744 million in cash and equivalents, management expects cash burn to rise in the current quarter, and there is a risk of delays and setbacks in the development process. As Virgin Galactic's CEO might say, 'space is hard,' and the company's financial situation is precarious, with no room for error.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2024 11:11 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

However, the company's revenue fell short of expectations. According to the company's press release, the net loss in July-September was $74.5 million, compared to $104.6 million in the same period last year. The loss per share decreased to $2.66 from $5.57 a year ago, below the average forecast of $4.01 per share by FacSet analysts. Virgin Galactic's quarterly revenue decreased by more than four times to $402,000 from $1.7 million in the third quarter of last year, below the average forecast of $2.1 million. The company attributes the decline in revenue to a pause in commercial space flights due to its focus on producing Delta-class spacecraft. 'Our spacecraft production program is on track, and commercial operation will start in 2026,' said Michael Colglazier, CEO of Virgin Galactic. The company also announced plans to issue up to $300 million in common stock, with proceeds to be used to fund the development of a new generation of spacecraft.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 11:21 AM\nSource:[interfax.ru](https://www.interfax.ru/business/990771)\n\n**NM Virgin Galactic workers to embark on spaceship assembly**\nVirgin Galactic announced that workers from New Mexico will participate in spaceship assembly at its Phoenix facility. CEO Michael Colglazier stated that the company will ramp up hiring in the Phoenix and Mesa areas in Q4, in advance of spaceship assembly work in early 2025. Colglazier emphasized the importance of airframe and powerplant mechanics, manufacturing engineers, quality inspectors, and other key personnel to assist teammates who have relocated to Phoenix. Doug Ahrens, Virgin Galactic's chief financial officer, shared that revenue for Q3 was $402,000, driven by membership fees to its Future Astronaut community. Ahrens also stated that the company's balance sheet 'remains strong,' with $744 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Virgin Galactic projects an uptick in spending for Q1 2025, with costs thereafter 'meaningfully reduced' due to progress toward assembly and testing of two new Delta spaceships. The company expects to double revenue and quadruple EBITDA by 2026, leveraging its fixed-cost base at Spaceport America in New Mexico.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 08:21 PM\nSource:[bizjournals.com](https://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/inno/stories/news/2024/11/07/virgin-galactic-shares-q4-financials-nm-fleet.html)\n\n**Virgin Galactic building the foundation for strong future profitability: KeyBanc**\nVirgin Galactic's progress toward its new Delta class spacecraft is a positive sign for the company's future profitability, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets.

The company also announced an at-the-market equity program to sell shares worth as much as $300 million to fund its next-generation spaceflight fleet. Virgin has been burning through $120 million in cash a quarter after pausing its space tourism trips. The company's last flight took place in June, and it's halted further trips while working on its more advanced Delta spaceship expected to enter commercial service in 2026. Virgin aims to have a second 'mothership' operational around 2028 and expects to clear its existing backlog of around 700 ticket holders in about a year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 03:15 PM\nSource:[finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virgin-galactic-halt-tourism-flights-213707716.html)\n\n**Richard Branson's Spaceflight Startup Virgin Galactic Sees Stock Surge After Narrowing Q3 Losses, Announces $300M Stock Sale - Virgin Galactic Hldgs (NYSE:SPCE)**\nVirgin Galactic Holdings Inc.

The company's total operating expenses fell to $82.1 million, while revenue dropped to $0.4 million due to the pause in commercial spaceflights. Virgin Galactic is now focusing on producing the Delta Class spaceships, which are on track to enter commercial service in 2026.

According to CEO Michael Colglazier, 'this will allow Virgin Galactic to achieve economies of scale from existing investments, build a second mothership and two additional Delta-class vehicles much sooner than if they were financed solely through organic growth.' The company plans to use the additional capital to accelerate work on two more Delta-class vehicles and a second basic aircraft, allowing them to enter commercial operation in 2028, two years earlier than previously planned. According to CFO Doug Hurley, this will result in 'full utilization' of the 'Spaceport America' in New Mexico and double revenue, while increasing EBITDA by four times. Virgin Galactic plans to begin designing the second mothership in 2025, transition to production in 2026, and conduct testing in 2027, before entering commercial operation in 2028. The company will build this aircraft in-house, using engineering and production workforce that will be transferred from work on Delta-class spaceplanes. Work on the first Delta-class vehicles is progressing well, with subcontractors Bell Textron and Qarbon Aerospace making progress in developing tools and components for the vehicles. Assembly of the first Delta-class vehicle is on schedule and will begin in the first quarter of 2025 at the company's new facility near Phoenix, with rollout and ground testing planned for the second half of 2025.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 07:17 AM\nSource:[iXBT.com](https://www.ixbt.com/news/2024/11/07/virgin-galactic-300.html)\n\n**Virgin Galactic Announces At-The-Market Equity Program By Investing.com**\nVirgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. has announced an at-the-market equity program (A™ Program) to sell up to $300 million worth of its common stock.

The company stated that Burns' decision to resign was not due to any disagreement with Virgin Galactic regarding its operations, policies, or practices. The departure of a high-ranking executive could be a significant event for stakeholders, as the Director of Information role is crucial for overseeing the company's technology information strategies. Virgin Galactic has not announced a successor or provided details on its plans to cover the vacant position. The transition in leadership comes as the company works towards its goals in the competitive and rapidly evolving commercial spaceflight sector. Investors and industry observers will be closely watching how Virgin Galactic navigates this change in leadership and any potential impact on the company's strategic direction. According to the company's statements in the SEC presentation, Virgin Galactic is maintaining a positive outlook, with Jefferies reiterating its Buy rating. However, Morgan Stanley has reduced its price target from $35.00 to $5.00, maintaining its Hold rating.

Despite the stock's struggles, consensus price targets remain relatively high, suggesting that analysts believe the company has potential for future growth. The company's first commercial launch is expected to generate significant media attention and investor interest, and the year 2025 is shaping up to be a big one for Virgin Galactic stock. However, the company must overcome significant financial and regulatory hurdles to achieve profitable citizen spaceflights. Analysts are mixed on the stock, with price targets ranging from $0.75 to $47, and the company's short interest is over 25%, adding a potential element of short squeeze volatility.

According to a report by PwC Strategy& and the Italian National Aerospace Authority, the high cost of insurance for suborbital space flights will be due to the novelty of this activity. With only 54 unique rocket engine launches having taken place, including demonstrations, tests, and commercial flights, and 73 passengers having participated in space flights, the insurance companies will likely factor in the test launches, resulting in a failure rate of 5-8%. However, as Marco Cattadori from PwC Strategy& notes, as the number of commercial suborbital space flights increases, the number of failed launches will decrease. The current US legislation protects commercial companies from liability claims as long as the operator provides sufficient warnings and the space flight participants assume the risks. However, this law expires on January 1, 2025, and companies may face difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for passenger injury risks. The authors of the study considered insurance coverage for individual passengers ranging from $300,000 to $5 million. If liability were set at $3 million per person, an operator of a six-seat vehicle, such as the Delta-class spacecraft from Virgin Galactic, would pay between $1.3 million and $2.1 million for coverage of $18 million. The high cost of insurance may lead to a 30-60% increase in launch prices. However, experts believe this is a temporary issue, and as the failure rates of space vehicles decrease, insurance premiums will also decrease.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 06:00 PM\nSource:[iXBT.com](https://www.ixbt.com/news/2024/10/16/issledovanie-kompanii-osushestvljajushie-kommercheskie-suborbitalnye-kosmicheskie-zapuski-mogut-stolknutsja-s-problemoj.html)\n\n**When Is Virgin Galactic's Next Launch?**\nVirgin Galactic has successfully completed 12 spaceflights, including their most recent, 'Galactic 07,' the final commercial flight of the VSS Unity.

Virgin Galactic has a storied past, having partnered with Scaled Composites to create SpaceShipOne, the first privately funded spacecraft to reach space. The company has faced setbacks, including a tragic accident in 2014, but has implemented design modifications and safety improvements, leading to the development of VSS Unity. Virgin Galactic has made history with its first fully crewed flight in 2021 and has conducted several more crewed flights, including commercial missions.

The company is preparing for the introduction of its Delta spaceship in 2026, which is expected to significantly ramp up operations. Virgin Galactic anticipates peak free cash flow usage in 2024, with a reduction in 2025 as one-time costs decline. The company has already booked 700 customers from 60 countries, targeting a market of 300,000 potential customers. The Delta spaceship's design, featuring a replaceable rocket motor, is expected to allow hundreds of flights annually. Virgin Galactic's scale-up strategy is designed to leverage fixed costs and improve margins, with EBITDA margins of 20 to 25% expected with the initial fleet, increasing to 48% with four spaceships and two motherships. Despite facing a significant price target cut from Morgan Stanley, Virgin Galactic has made significant progress in the development of its Delta Class spaceships and projects substantial revenue growth, with an annual revenue target of $450 million with its initial fleet, potentially reaching $2 billion as its fleet and spaceports expand.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 04, 2024 06:27 PM\nSource:[Investing.com UK](https://uk.investing.com/news/company-news/virgin-galactic-shares-hold-steady-with-10-target-from-jefferies-93CH-3723363)\n\n**Bank downgrades Virgin Galactic**\nMorgan Stanley has downgraded Virgin Galactic's share price target from $35 to $5, citing ongoing challenges and a lack of near-term catalysts for the stock. The bank notes that Virgin Galactic's business model relies on delivering a new fleet on schedule and at cost, which has not been achieved. The company's last flight was in June 2024, and it does not anticipate resuming revenue-generating flights until 2026. Morgan Stanley is skeptical of Virgin Galactic's ability to meet its ambitious goals, including achieving $450 million in annual revenue at 20-25% margins by late 2027.

According to NASA, the leak poses a risk to the ISS's goal of operating until 2030 and could lead to 'a catastrophic failure' of the station, as stated by Bob Cabana, chair of the agency's ISS Advisory Committee. However, Russian space officials have downplayed the severity of the leak, insisting it will not jeopardize future ISS operations. NASA and Roscosmos have agreed to seal off the leaky segment if the rate of air loss becomes 'untenable,' but they have not yet reached a consensus on what qualifies as an untenable rate. Currently, air is escaping at a rate of around 2 to 2.5 pounds per day above the space station's equilibrium. NASA plans to add an extra seat aboard future SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft in case any astronauts need to evacuate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 22, 2024 06:46 PM\nSource:[livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/space/space-exploration/nasa-warns-of-potential-catastrophic-failure-on-leaking-iss-but-russia-doesnt-want-to-fix-it)\n\n**Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore Rescue Mission: NASA to Ensure Safe Return of Stranded Astronauts by February 2025**\nIndian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore have been stranded at the International Space Station (ISS) since June 5, 2024, due to technical issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. NASA has launched an uncrewed spacecraft to deliver 3 tons of food, fuel, and essential supplies to the astronauts. Despite growing concerns about their health, NASA has reassured the public that the astronauts are in good condition, undergoing regular medical check-ups and monitored closely by flight surgeons. To counter the health risks of long-term space travel, astronauts on the ISS follow a strict exercise regimen.

The spacecraft took astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station (ISS), but returned empty to Earth after the space agency concluded that it was too dangerous to bring them back in the capsule. Now, the duo remains on the ISS until 2025. According to Richard Jones, NASA's Commercial Crew Program Manager, 'We're just starting - trying to understand how to correct and rectify the problems that are on the table.' The teams will continue to work on the schedules and requirements needed to meet them. The Starliner was launched on June 5 in the CFT mission and docked with the orbital laboratory the next day, despite failures in its propulsion systems. NASA and Boeing spent several months investigating the incident, while delaying the spacecraft's return. As the CFT was an experimental mission with an untested spacecraft for crewed flights, it was natural that failures occurred and schedules changed. The Starliner-1, the first operational mission of the vehicle, is scheduled to be launched in 2025, but it is unclear if the launch will happen as originally planned.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 01:28 PM\nSource:[Canaltech](https://canaltech.com.br/espaco/nasa-continua-tentando-corrigir-problemas-na-nave-starliner-da-boeing/)\n\n**NASA still working to 'correct and rectify' Boeing Starliner issues after 1st test flight with astronauts**\nNASA is still working to resolve the issues that caused Boeing's Starliner spacecraft to return to Earth without its astronauts after the first crewed test flight.

The Starliner, built by Boeing, had a troubled past, including a previous flight that was aborted due to helium leaks and propulsion system issues. The two astronauts on board, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, were 'stuck' on the spacecraft, but will now return to Earth on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft in February 2025. The Starliner is now uncertain about its future, as NASA has announced that it will not be ready to transport astronauts in the summer of 2025. 'The timing and configuration of the next Starliner flight will be determined once Boeing's path towards certification of the system is better understood', said NASA. Meanwhile, SpaceX has been given the mission Crew-10, which was originally scheduled for the Starliner, and will now carry two American astronauts, an Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut to the ISS in February 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 21, 2024 10:39 AM\nSource:[LaSexta](https://www.lasexta.com/tecnologia-tecnoxplora/ciencia/nasa-cancela-viaje-previsto-starliner-spacex_2024102167162f23e2e54f000187ae0a.html)\n\n**Will Starliner, the Boeing spacecraft that took Sunita Williams to space, fly again?**\nBoeing's Starliner spacecraft, which carried Sunita Williams to space, has raised concerns about its viability in NASA's Commercial Crew Program. The recent Crew Flight Test was cut short due to technical issues, and NASA has confirmed that it will continue to use SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft through 2025. Boeing's financial and reputational costs are mounting, and the company will need to conduct a thorough review of the mission data and address the technical issues to determine whether Starliner will fly again with a crew. NASA officials have expressed confidence in Starliner's safety, but the decision to err on the side of caution points to the complexities and risks inherent in human spaceflight. Boeing will need to demonstrate significant improvements and reliability in Starliner's performance to secure its place in future missions. 'It marks another delay in Starliner's certification process, potentially widening the gap with SpaceX's already operational Dragon capsule,' said Steve Stich, manager of the Commercial Crew Program. 'However, NASA has consistently expressed its desire for multiple crew transport options to ensure reliable access to the ISS,' he added. 'The coming months will be critical in determining whether Starliner can overcome its troubled history and emerge as a viable option for crewed spaceflight, or if it will join the ranks of spacecraft that never fully realised their potential.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2024 06:36 AM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/will-starliner-the-boeing-spacecraft-that-took-sunita-williams-to-space-fly-again-2620337-2024-10-21)\n\n**NASA Freezes Starliner Missions Indefinitely**\nNASA has announced that the next Crew-10 mission with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft will not take place until at least February 2025, followed by the Crew-11 mission in July 2025.

The agency plans to use SpaceX's Crew Dragon for future manned missions to the ISS while the Starliner issue is resolved. NASA has announced that the Crew-10 mission will not launch before February 2025, and the Crew-11 mission will not launch until July 2025. Boeing had planned to conduct the first operational mission to the ISS in early 2025, but the first crewed flight of the Starliner ended in failure. Now, Boeing is further away from certifying its space transportation system. NASA will determine the schedule and configuration of the next Starliner flight after establishing a better understanding of Boeing's path to certification, which will include lessons learned from the Crew Flight Test, final certification products, and operational readiness. The agency is considering various certification options, including a potential Starliner flight in 2025, but it is unclear whether the flight will include a crew on board or if the spacecraft will fly to the ISS alone. 'We will determine the best path forward for Starliner after we have a better understanding of the certification process,' said NASA. Boeing has not yet fulfilled its $4.3 billion contract with NASA under the Commercial Crew Program. During the first uncrewed test flight of the Starliner in 2019, a software automation glitch caused the spacecraft to burn excess fuel and fail to reach the ISS. In May 2022, Boeing completed the second uncrewed flight of the Starliner, Orbital Flight Test-2, but several issues arose, including a malfunctioning engine used for orbital maneuvering. In the first half of October 2024, Boeing's leadership announced plans to lay off 10% of its employees, or 17,000 people, over the next few months, affecting managers, executives, and regular employees.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 20, 2024 06:46 AM\nSource:[Хабр](https://habr.com/ru/news/851980/)\n\n**NASA Suspends Boeing's Starliner Space Missions After Malfunction**\nNASA has suspended all future space missions with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft after a malfunction, leaving astronauts Sonita Williams and Barry Wilmore stranded on the International Space Station.

Although the June flight successfully transported two astronauts to the ISS, incidents prevented their return to Earth as planned. The NASA has decided to bring the astronauts back in February 2025 using a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, instead of the same Starliner capsule. The Starliner-1 commercial mission, initially scheduled for February 2025, has been delayed to August 2025 at the earliest. The NASA is still evaluating the CFT mission and considering whether to conduct a second test flight, CFT-2, to ensure the issues, such as overheating thrusters, are resolved before proceeding with the first commercial mission. 'The evaluation of the entire CFT mission, from the chaotic docking at the ISS to the return to Earth, is not yet complete,' said the NASA. 'This issue is still pending and could still impact the schedule for Starliner-1.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 17, 2024 10:30 AM\nSource:[generation-nt.com](https://www.generation-nt.com/actualites/boeing-starliner-cst-100-capsule-spatiale-report-mission-commerciale-2051664)\n\n**NASA is planning to give the beleaguered Boeing Starliner another shot at space  --  in late 2025**\nNASA has released its 2025 commercial launch schedule, which includes a third attempt for the Boeing Starliner to reach space.

NASA is keeping options open for system certification, including potential windows for a Starliner flight in 2025. The first planned launch of 2025 is the SpaceX Crew-10 mission, targeting a launch 'no earlier than February 2025.' Meanwhile, NASA is working with SpaceX to bring astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back to Earth via the SpaceX Crew Dragon in February 2025, after the Starliner's recent issues with thrusters and helium leaks. The commercial space exploration race between Boeing and SpaceX continues, with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk accusing the Federal Aviation Administration of playing favorites with Boeing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2024 09:09 AM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-boeing-starliner-launch-late-2025-2024-10)\n\n**Sunita Williams' spacecraft set for redemption?

The spacecraft carried astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore to space but returned to Earth without its crew in September. NASA is preparing for the next launch, considering lessons learned from the previous test and operational readiness. The US space agency is keeping options open for how to achieve system certification, including a potential flight in 2025. Williams and Wilmore will continue their work aboard the space station as part of the Expedition 71/72 crew. NASA looks forward to working with the Boeing team to certify Starliner for crew rotation missions to the space station, as stated by NASA. 'This determination will include considerations for incorporating Crew Flight Test lessons learned, approvals of final certification products, and operational readiness,' NASA said. The goal of NASA's Commercial Crew Program is 'safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation to and from the International Space Station and low Earth orbit.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 03:20 PM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/science/news/sunita-williams-spacecraft-set-for-redemption-nasa-boeing-plans-starliner-next-lift-off-in-2025-but-conditions-apply-11729089674453.html)\n\n**NASA orders up more SpaceX flights, tables Boeing’s Starliner until at least late 2025**\nNASA has awarded SpaceX with the next two missions to the International Space Station, Crew-10 and Crew-11, with the latter targeting a July launch.

NASA's Commercial Crew Program has given Boeing a path forward to correct issues with its spacecraft, but certification is still uncertain. SpaceX has already flown 15 missions to the ISS, including nine operational flights, and has earned more money from NASA with additional flights ordered. Boeing, on the other hand, has reported over $1.6 billion in losses while only getting a portion of its original contract for development costs.

However, a last-minute change in the contract allowed both Boeing and SpaceX to participate. The decision was influenced by Boeing's refusal to perform a critical test of the Starliner's abort system, which led to concerns about the company's offer. SpaceX's lower price and better performance in the evaluation process also played a role in the decision. As a result, NASA was able to award contracts to both companies, which ultimately led to the successful rescue of astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunni Williams, who were stranded on the ISS due to a problem with the Starliner.

Freddie Mac announced on Thursday that the rate is now 20 basis points above the previous week's average of 6.12%. This increase is closely tied to recent economic data that has exceeded expectations, leading investors to reassess their predictions for future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The mortgage rate typically moves in sync with the 10-year Treasury bond yield, which rose after strong employment growth in September and a decline in the unemployment rate. These indicators have led market operators to anticipate more modest and less frequent rate cuts by the Fed in the coming months. This rise in mortgage rates breaks a downward trend that had been observed since May, when the market was preparing for the Fed to initiate a rate cut, which began last month. Current market projections suggest that the Fed's benchmark rate, currently between 4.75% and 5.00%, could fall to a range of 3.50% to 3.75% by mid-next year.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 04:46 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Español](https://es.investing.com/news/economy-news/la-tasa-hipotecaria-a-30-anos-en-ee-uu-salta-al-632-93CH-2863094)\n\n**US 30-Year Fixed Mortgage Rate Rises to 6.32%**\nThe 30-year fixed mortgage rate in the US has risen to 6.32% this week, marking the largest weekly increase since April. According to Freddie Mac, this rate is 20 basis points higher than the previous week's average of 6.12%. Last year at this time, the rate was 7.57%. This increase is attributed to recent economic data exceeding expectations, causing investors to reassess their predictions for future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The mortgage rate often aligns with the 10-year Treasury yield, which has risen following strong employment growth in September and a decline in unemployment. This has led traders to anticipate fewer and smaller rate cuts from the Fed in the coming months. The rise in mortgage rates reverses a trend of declining rates since May, when the market expected the Fed to begin reducing rates, which started last month. Current market predictions suggest that the Fed's benchmark rate, currently between 4.75% and 5.00%, could be lowered to between 3.50% and 3.75% by mid-year next year.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 04:43 PM\nSource:[Investing.com France](https://fr.investing.com/news/economy-news/le-taux-hypothecaire-a-30-ans-aux-etatsunis-grimpe-a-632-93CH-2594445)\n\n**Average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. ticks up to 6.12%, first increase in 7 weeks**\nThe average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. rose to 6.12% this week, the first increase in seven weeks, according to Freddie Mac. This comes after the rate slipped to its lowest level in two years last week, boosting home shoppers' purchasing power. However, mortgage rates are still down from their 2024 peak of 7.22% in May. Freddie Mac Chief Economist Sam Khater remains optimistic, stating that 'zooming out to the bigger picture, mortgage rates have declined one and a half percentage points over the last 12 months, home price growth is slowing, inventory is increasing, and incomes continue to rise.'

This is down from 6.09% last week and 7.31% a year ago. Freddie Mac's chief economist, Sam Khater, stated, 'Although this week's decline was slight, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage trended down to its lowest level in two years.' The decline in rates has led to an increase in refinance activity, allowing homeowners to trim their monthly mortgage payments.

This is a significant decrease compared to the same period last year, when the interest rate was 7.31%.

Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's Chief Economist, said, 'Although this week's decline was slight, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage trended down to its lowest level in two years.' This decline has led to an increase in refinance activity, allowing homeowners to trim their monthly mortgage payments. However, potential homebuyers are waiting to see if rates decrease further with the release of additional economic data over the next several weeks.

According to the New York Times, the small team of 20 employees has been working long hours to keep up with the demand. Despite having fewer accounts (21+ million) compared to Threads (275 million), Bluesky has more active web users in the US and UK, according to Similarweb. The sudden surge in users is attributed to several factors, including X's decision to allow third-party use of its user data to train AI models, which led to 5 million users joining Bluesky in just five days, as reported by Morning Brew.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 23, 2024 05:01 AM\nSource:[Morning Brew](https://www.morningbrew.com/stories/2024/11/23/bluesky-having-its-justin-bieber-moment)\n\n**Threads to Show More Posts from Subscribed Users and Fewer Recommendations**\nThreads, a Meta alternative, will start showing users more posts from people they are subscribed to and fewer recommendations, according to the platform's head, Adam Mosseri, as reported by The Verge. Mosseri stated that users should receive more interactions from people they are subscribed to than from random social media users. He also mentioned that the company is still working to balance the number of recommendations in the feed. This change was prompted by a large number of users switching to BlueSky, where all posts from people they are subscribed to are shown in chronological order. BlueSky's user base has grown from 15 million in September 2024 to 21 million in November 2024. Despite BlueSky's popularity, Threads still leads with a significant margin, with 15 million new users registering in November alone. However, the popularity of competitors has forced the company to make changes.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: November 22, 2024 12:14 PM\nSource:[mezha.media](https://mezha.media/2024/11/22/threads-less-recommendations-in-feed/)\n\n**Bluesky Shows More Major Growth - The Race Is On With X And Threads**\nBluesky, a social network competing with X, has reached 20 million users, a significant milestone that indicates it is closing the gap with X and Instagram Threads in terms of daily active users and website visits. According to analytics firm App Figures, Bluesky has been the top non-gaming app on Google Play for four days and the top app in Apple's App Store for six days straight. While Threads has 275 million monthly active users, Bluesky's growth rate suggests it may not stay behind for long. Similarweb notes that the gap between Bluesky and Threads' daily active users has shrunk from five times to 1.5 times, and X's dominance may be shifting. Bluesky's rapid rise shows there's still demand for an alternative to X that values privacy and transparency, potentially reshaping the social media landscape.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 21, 2024 11:30 PM\nSource:[thespacelab.tv](https://www.thespacelab.tv/Content/2024/11-November/Bluesky-20-Million-Users.html)\n\n**Bluesky Surpasses 20 Million Users, Continuing Recent Growth**\nBluesky has surpassed 20 million users, continuing its recent growth. The decentralized service, which had 15 million users just a week ago, has tripled its user base in the past three months. Bluesky's current momentum is notable, despite being smaller than its competitors Threads and X. The app added 1 million new users in just 24 hours last week, similar to Threads' daily growth rate of 1 million new users for 'three months', according to Adam Mosseri's update last week. Threads has reached 275 million monthly users this month and added at least 15 million since November. Bluesky's recent growth is partly due to increasing frustration among some X users. There was a significant increase in traffic to Bluesky on November 7, the day after the presidential election, according to a report from SimilarWeb. This increase coincided with an increase in the number of users trying to deactivate their X accounts. Bluesky has also differentiated itself from its larger competitors. Last week, the company promised not to use user content to train AI models, unlike X's new privacy policy, which allows it to work with third parties to train AI models on users' past tweets. Bluesky's CEO, Jay Graber, said she doesn't want to 'add excitement to the network through ads', while Threads is reportedly planning to start its first ad experiment in January.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 21, 2024 01:26 PM\nSource:[alwafd.news](https://www.alwafd.news/5490807)\n\n**Bluesky hits 20 Million users, rapidly closing gap with threads**\nBluesky, a decentralized social network, has reached 20 million users, closing the gap with Instagram Threads. According to Similarweb, Bluesky's daily active users (DAU) in the U.S. are now just 1.5 times behind Threads, a significant decrease from earlier. Bluesky has also surpassed Threads in daily website visits in the U.S. and the UK. The platform's mobile app usage has surged, with a 519% increase in usage following the U.S. mid-November elections. Several factors contributing to this growth include X's controversial decisions, such as selling user data and altering blocking features. Bluesky's growth momentum began in February 2023, with its user base growing from 9 million to 20 million in November. Since the U.S. elections, Bluesky has been gaining 100,000 new users daily.

However, Bluesky's growth rate is noteworthy. According to Similarweb, Bluesky's daily active users (DAU) in the US have largely closed the gap with Threads. On November 15, during one of Bluesky's busiest days, Threads' leadership in the US was reduced to a 1.5 times difference. Additionally, Bluesky has surpassed Threads in daily website visits in the US and UK. Although Threads still maintains a small lead globally, Bluesky is rapidly closing the gap. Bluesky's mobile app has also seen a significant surge. Similarweb's data shows that its usage rate increased by 519% in the US after the November mid-term elections. The app reached the top spot on the US App Store on November 13, surpassing Threads and X. Android usage rates have also seen a year-over-year increase of over 360%. The reasons behind this growth include X's decision to sell user data to a AI company and change its blocking feature, as well as Elon Musk's use of X to support Donald Trump's presidential campaign, which has driven away many users. Bluesky has seen a significant surge in growth since its public launch in February 2023, with its user base increasing from 9 million in September to 20 million in November. Since the US elections, the platform has been gaining 100,000 new users per day. Bluesky is showing itself to be a serious competitor to social media giants X and Threads.

To make the most of Bluesky, users can use starter packs to find accounts, lists to discover new accounts, and customize their feed. They can also control their feed, use a custom domain, combat trolls, filter content, and avoid AI training.

The app has tripled its user base in the last three months, with a recent growth rate similar to that of its competitor *Threads, which adds 1 million new users daily. Despite being smaller than *Threads and X, Bluesky's growth is notable. The app has topped the App Store for the last six days and was the top non-game app in Google Play for four consecutive days, according to App Figures. One reason for Bluesky's growth is user dissatisfaction with X, which led to a surge in traffic on November 7, the day after the presidential election. Bluesky stands out from its competitors with its app usage policies, such as a commitment not to use user content for training generative AI, unlike X's new privacy policy, which allows third parties to train AI models on user tweets, as stated by 'We are not going to use user content for training generative AI, unlike some other platforms.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 07:59 AM\nSource:[Рамблер](https://news.rambler.ru/tech/53774920-vsego-za-nedelyu-u-sotsseti-buduschego-bluesky-stalo-na-5-mln-polzovateley-bolshe/)\n\n**Bluesky Surpasses 20 Million Users, Releases Version 1.94**\nBluesky has surpassed 20 million users, with a growth rate of over 1 million users per day in the past few days.

The Musk-owned app X remains dominant, but Bluesky's momentum is notable, with several days of adding a million new users in a single 24-hour period.

Bluesky's CEO, Jay Graber, has stated that the company does not want to 'enshittify the network with ads.' In contrast, Bluesky's rival, Threads, plans to start experimenting with ads in January. Bluesky's growth is also attributed to mounting frustration from some X users, with a significant spike in traffic to Bluesky on November 7, the day after the presidential election.

According to social media researcher Axel Bruns, Bluesky has become a refuge for people who want to escape the far-right activism, misinformation, and hate speech on Elon Musk's X. Bruns stated, 'It's become a refuge for people who want to have the kind of social media experience that Twitter used to provide, but without all the far-right activism, the misinformation, the hate speech, the bots and everything else.' The influx of users has been attributed to the results of the 2024 US Election, with a more liberal community migrating from X to Bluesky.

The platform was initially created and funded by Twitter, but has since become a competitor to X, which has been criticized for its relaxed moderation policies and spread of misinformation.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 11:40 AM\nSource:[BFMTV](https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/actualites/reseaux-sociaux/un-million-d-utilisateurs-en-24-heures-bluesky-alternative-a-x-ex-twitter-continue-de-seduire_AD-202411150560.html)\n\n**Bluesky Reaches 16 Million Users, 1 Million in 24 Hours, Despite Technical Issue**\nBluesky, a social media platform competing with X, has reached 16 million users, with 1 million new users in just 24 hours. This milestone was achieved despite a technical issue on Thursday, November 14, which was caused by a combination of factors, including a fiber cut, network problems at the datacenter, and DNS issues at Cloudflare. According to Bluesky's CEO, Jay Graber, the platform has higher engagement rates than X, with 'the number of subscribers being misleading.' Graber shared a post by scientist Andrew Dessler, who compared the engagement rates on X and Bluesky by posting the same message on both platforms. Bluesky's user base has been growing rapidly, with 10 million users in mid-September, 13 million in late October, and now over 16 million. This growth is partly due to X's controversies, such as its ban in Brazil and Elon Musk's support for Donald Trump, which led to a surge in Bluesky's user base.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 09:33 AM\nSource:[next.ink](https://next.ink/brief_article/bluesky-1-million-de-nouveaux-utilisateurs-en-24h-malgre-une-petite-panne/)\n\n**Bluesky Reaches 15 Million Users, Gaining Traction as Alternative to X**\nBluesky, a short-form social network, has reached 15 million registered users, according to Stats for Bluesky. This number represents a significant increase from 2 million users in November 2023, with an average of 1 million new accounts per month. While the platform still lags behind its main competitors, X (formerly Twitter) and Threads, it is gaining traction as a third option for those dissatisfied with the other two. Bluesky's unique features, such as its 'antitoxicidade' tool and user-customizable feed, are attracting users who are looking for an alternative to X. The platform is also experiencing growth in the US, particularly among Democrats who are dissatisfied with Elon Musk's leadership and the spread of misinformation on X. The Guardian, a prominent British newspaper, has also left X due to its toxic environment and Musk's influence on the platform's discourse.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 12:41 AM\nSource:[olhardigital.com.br](https://olhardigital.com.br/2024/11/14/internet-e-redes-sociais/bluesky-rompe-marca-dos-15-milhoes-de-usuarios-enquanto-pessoas-buscam-por-alternativas-ao-x/)\n\n**Bluesky Reaches 16 Million Users, Surpasses Threads in iOS Downloads**\nBluesky has added another million users in 24 hours, bringing its total to 16 million. This growth is largely due to the alliance between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Additionally, over 13,000 people have created accounts using the swifties.social domain, indicating they are fans of Taylor Swift. Bluesky has become the most downloaded free app on the iOS store in the US, surpassing ChatGPT and Threads. However, the company has faced two issues: a software problem causing the 'Invalide Handle' error and slow post loading, and three technical issues: a Cogent Communications fiber optic cut, a networking problem with a provider, and a Cloudflare DNS issue. Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, announced that Threads gained 15 million new users in November, to which Bluesky responded with irony, saying 'everyone is talking about Bluesky' and that it will not show ads, unlike Threads which will start showing ads in January 2025.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[punto-informatico.it](https://www.punto-informatico.it/bluesky-altro-milione-utenti-24-ore/)\n\n**Bluesky Reaches 1 Million Users in Just One Week, a Decentralized Alternative to X**\nBluesky, a decentralized social network, has reached one million users in just one week, topping the App Store charts. This surge in registrations follows the 2024 US elections, during which many users, primarily from the liberal side, left X (formerly Twitter) to migrate to Bluesky. According to Axel Bruns, a social network researcher, Bluesky represents an attractive alternative to Musk's X: 'It's become a refuge for those seeking a social experience similar to the old Twitter, but without the rise of far-right activism, disinformation, hate speech, bots, and other disturbing elements.' The liberal Twitter community has largely left X for Bluesky, with around half a million users switching after X announced plans to modify its blocking feature. The situation is also influenced by Elon Musk's close ties to the future US president, who supported the Republican candidate throughout the campaign. Bluesky's growth is part of its constant expansion, with 13 million users as of late October and a recent funding round of $15 million. The platform plans to use these funds to support and expand its community, strengthen trust and security measures, and promote its development ecosystem.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 09:20 AM\nSource:[blog-nouvelles-technologies.fr](https://www.blog-nouvelles-technologies.fr/310476/bluesky-1-million-utilisateurs-une-semaine/)\n\n**Bluesky hits 15 million users, tops US App Store in Social Networking**\nBluesky, a decentralized social network, has reached 15.1 million registered users, making it the most downloaded app in the US App Store in the Social Networking category. This growth is attributed to people seeking alternatives to X (formerly Twitter) and Threads, with Bluesky experiencing rapid expansion, especially after a temporary ban on X in Brazil. According to a stats tracking website, Bluesky had only 2 million users in November 2023. The platform is planning to offer a paid subscription with extra features, similar to X Premium. Despite having fewer users than competitors, Bluesky is attracting those dissatisfied with X and Threads, with some users signing up at a rate of over a million per day.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 07:53 AM\nSource:[Phone Arena](https://www.phonearena.com/news/bluesky-hits-15-million-users_id164792)\n\n**Bluesky Sees 700,000 New Users in One Week Following Trump's Election**\nBluesky, a social media platform launched in 2023, has seen a significant increase in users since Donald Trump's election, with 700,000 new users joining in one week. The platform now has 14.5 million users, up from 9 million in September. According to Bluesky, the influx of users, mainly from the UK and North America, has helped the platform reach this milestone. Emily Liu, Bluesky's spokesperson, said, 'We're thrilled to welcome all these new people, from Swifties to urban planners.' Axel Bruns, a media and social network expert, explained, 'Bluesky has become a refuge for people who want to experience the same type of experience as Twitter, but without the extreme right activism, misinformation, hateful speech, bots, and all the rest.' Bluesky's ability to block or suspend problematic accounts and monitor harmful behavior makes it a more effective alternative to X, according to Bruns.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 03:30 PM\nSource:[L'Obs](https://www.nouvelobs.com/high-tech/20241112.OBS96252/apres-l-election-de-trump-bluesky-enregistre-un-bond-de-700-000-nouveaux-membres-en-une-semaine.html)\n\n**Bluesky's New Subscription Model: A Free and Equal Experience for All Users**\nBluesky, an alternative to X, has reached 13 million users, up from 10 million just a month ago.

However, Bluesky emphasizes that the platform will remain free to use, unlike X, which charges users for posting and tries to encourage them to buy a premium subscription with controversial methods. Unlike X, Bluesky's paid subscribers will not receive special treatment, such as upranking or blue checks, and the platform will not sell user data or hyperfinancialize the social experience. Bluesky is also planning to introduce payment plans to support creators on the platform, with details to follow.

The company also revealed its plans, which include a subscription model. According to Rose Wang, the head of operations, the paid plan will offer features such as higher-quality video uploads and new customization options for profiles, such as colors and photo frame options. Bluesky also took a jab at X (formerly Twitter), stating that subscribers will not have increased reach for their posts. X Premium, on the other hand, gives more visibility to paid users' posts. 'Bluesky will always be free to use - we believe that information and debate should be easily accessible, not locked behind a paywall,' Wang wrote. Bluesky also rejected the use of cryptocurrencies and NFTs, stating that it will not 'hyperfinance' the social experience with tokens, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or similar. The platform has 13 million users, up from 1 million in July 2023, largely due to the migration of users from X, which has faced several controversies, including changes to its blocking feature and AI training policies.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 11:16 PM\nSource:[tecnoblog.net](https://tecnoblog.net/noticias/bluesky-revela-seus-planos-para-lancar-assinaturas/)\n\n**Bluesky Reaches 13 Million Users, Announces New Funding**\nBluesky, a potential challenger to Twitter, has reached 13 million users, with 2 million added in the last week due to changes at X.

Bluesky is working on a subscription model and voluntary monetization path for creators, which could provide a more reliable path forward. However, it still lags behind Meta's Threads, which has 200 million active users.

According to Rose Wang, head of operations, 'The paid subscribers will not receive a special treatment in any other part of the application, such as increased visibility for premium accounts or blue badges next to their names.' The subscription is aimed at helping Bluesky cover its costs, including personnel and infrastructure expenses. The platform has raised $15 million in funding and plans to use the money to develop its premium subscription, improve the app, and invest in its Trust and Security department.

This has been met with criticism from some X users, who argue that this change allows stalkers to continue viewing blocked users' posts.

    "news": "Here are the relevant news articles:\n\n**US, UK, and France Allow Ukraine to Use Long-Range Missiles, Russia Sees 'New Escalation'**\nThe decision by US President Joe Biden to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles is linked to the victory of Donald Trump in the elections, as well as the advancement of Russian troops, according to Reuters and The Times, citing sources. The sources stated that the involvement of North Korean soldiers in the conflict in the Kursk region 'became a serious escalation' that required a response. However, it's not just about this. Trump's election, who 'is extremely skeptical about US support for Ukraine', forced the Biden administration to take additional steps to support Kyiv, explained two sources from Reuters. 'Territorial successes of Russia in Ukraine accelerated in 2024, - quotes The Times from a briefing of the British military intelligence. - The front line is now less stable than ever since the start of the conflict.' The removal of restrictions on British Storm Shadow missiles striking Russian territory indicates an attempt by the UK to stop the advancement of Russian forces in Ukraine, according to the article. 'It was a great day', said no one, but the situation is serious. The US, UK, and France have allowed Ukraine to use long-range missiles, which Russia considers a 'new escalation'. President Vladimir Putin warned in September about possible retaliatory measures in case of the West's permission to use long-range missiles by Ukraine. This would mean that 'NATO countries, the US, and European countries are at war with Russia', he noted. Putin applied a ballistic missile 'Orekh' to strike an object in Dnipro in response to Ukrainian attacks on November 21. Ukraine has already been using western weapons to strike deep into Russia, acknowledged the head of the Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate, Kirill Budanov, in the summer. The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, said in May that American weapons were already being used to strike beyond the combat zone. During the invasion of the Kursk region, Ukrainian forces used British Challenger 2 tanks, reported Sky News. The use of western weapons in the Kursk border area was also mentioned by the Russian deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky. The Russian Ministry of Defense has repeatedly reported attempts to attack Crimea with British Storm Shadow missiles. The city of Belgorod was also hit with Czech-made RM-70 Vampire rocket launchers.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 22, 2024 08:05 AM\nSource:[rbc.ru](https://www.rbc.ru/politics/22/11/2024/674021939a794713899cc89f?from=from_main_13)\n\n**US Explains Biden's Decision on Strikes**\nAccording to Reuters, Joe Biden's decision to allow NATO to strike deep into Russian territory using missiles may be an attempt to make parts of his Ukrainian agenda 'Trump-proof'. 'This decision may help make parts of Biden's Ukrainian agenda 'Trump-proof', ' Reuters quotes an anonymous US official as saying. However, some American analysts believe that this decision will delay the process of peaceful negotiations with Russia. Previously, 'SP' reported that China is willing to work with all parties to build a fair peace.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 21, 2024 11:51 PM\nSource:[Свободная Пресса](https://svpressa.ru/politic/news/438565/)\n\n**Ukraine Uses Western-Made Missiles to Strike Deep into Russia, Changing the Course of the War**\nUkraine has used Western-made missiles to strike deep into Russia, a move that could change the course of the war. According to Russia, Ukrainian forces have launched US-made 'Atacms' missiles into Russian territory, just days after receiving permission from the White House. The missiles have reportedly damaged a military facility in Bryansk, Russia, about 100 kilometers from the border. Sources close to the BBC say that British-made 'Storm Shadow' missiles, supplied to Ukraine, have also been used against targets inside Russia. BBC defense correspondent Jonathan Beale said, 'A few months ago, a defense source told me that the first time we would know that British-made Storm Shadow missiles had been used to strike targets inside Russia would be after it had happened.' US President Joe Biden had previously banned Ukraine from using long-range missiles, supplied by the US, to strike targets inside Russia, fearing escalation. However, France may also allow Ukrainian forces to launch 'Scalp' missiles, a French-made equivalent of the Storm Shadow, against Russia. There are hundreds of military targets inside western Russia that Ukrainian forces could strike, according to the American research center, the Institute for the Study of War. However, military analysts warn that using missiles to strike targets inside Russia may not be effective for Ukraine, as the targets they want to strike have been moved further away from the range of those missiles. The Atacms missile system is a US-made ballistic missile launched from the ground, using mobile launchers such as the HIMARS and HIMARS, both of which have been supplied to Ukraine. The maximum range of the Atacms missile is 300 kilometers, and it flies at a speed of three times the speed of sound, entering service in the US in 1986. It can carry two types of munitions: one is a single high-explosive warhead with a maximum weight of 220 kg, and the other contains clusters of small bombs that disperse upon impact over a wide area. Storm Shadow is a guided missile designed by France and Britain jointly. It flies at low altitude at speeds exceeding 965 km/h, following the curvature of the Earth before rising and impacting vertically on its target. It was designed to penetrate hardened targets such as underground bunkers, using 'primary material' that expels hot metal through the wall, followed by a bomb that explodes inside. Both Atacms and Storm Shadow/Scalp are high-precision guided missiles. Ukrainian forces have used Atacms for over a year against Russian forces inside Ukraine and against Russian bases near the border, used to launch attacks on Ukrainian territory. US President Biden had feared that using the missiles against targets inside Russia would escalate the conflict, drawing the US into war. On November 19, two days after Biden's easing of this restriction, Ukrainian forces launched missiles on a munitions depot in Karachiv in the Bryansk region of Russia, about 100 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, northeast of Kiev. Ukrainian forces did not specify the type of missile used, but US officials confirmed it was an Atacms. Russia said its air defenses intercepted five missiles, with one causing damage. US officials said Russia may have intercepted only two of the eight missiles. Russia warned of a 'suitable and tangible' response to the use of missiles on targets inside its territory. The Russian Foreign Ministry said, 'The use of Kiev's long-range missiles to attack our territory will constitute a direct US involvement in the hostilities against Russia, as well as a fundamental change in the nature and essence of the conflict.' The new policy was formulated by the White House as a measure to support Ukrainian forces inside Russia, which currently occupy about 500 square kilometers of territory in the Kursk region, expected to face a counterattack from Russian and North Korean forces. The arrival of around 10,000 North Korean special forces in Russia to fight against Ukraine is believed to have contributed to Biden's change of heart. The Institute for the Study of War identified 245 military facilities inside Russia within the range of Atacms missile strikes, including 16 airbases. Because it can cause explosions over a wide area, the cluster bomb warhead can be used effectively against concentrations of troops and aircraft, which are exposed in the open at airbases. The impact of Atacms missile strikes on the Russian military may be limited, according to Matthew Savage of the Royal United Services Institute, who knows the acronym 'Russia' and is based in Britain. Ukraine is eager to destroy Russian aircraft that launch cruise missiles and glide bombs against its forces on the front lines and against civilian infrastructure such as power plants. However, Savage says, 'Many of the best targets - helicopters and aircraft armed with glide bombs, which attack cities and Ukrainian forces in the north or in Kursk - have been moved to airbases outside the range of Atacms missile strikes... Some of these aircraft are based over 1,000 kilometers from Ukraine.' For months, Ukraine has asked Britain and France to allow it to launch Storm Shadow/Scalp missiles against targets inside Russia. In the past, its forces have used these missiles against targets in occupied Crimea - for example, against the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol. Jonathan Beale, BBC defense correspondent, says that the US decision to allow Ukraine to use Atacms missiles against targets inside Russia paves the way for Britain and France to follow the same approach with Storm Shadow/Scalp missiles. Storm Shadow/Scalp missiles differ from Atacms in that they are designed to attack hardened targets such as underground bunkers. Unlike Atacms, they cannot cause damage over a wide area. Savage says they are therefore 'not very useful against exposed forces or aircraft in the open at airbases.' He says, 'The Ukrainians will be looking for the best hardened targets, such as ammunition depots or fortified headquarters, and we should not expect to see a large number of Storm Shadow strikes anytime soon.' Launching Storm Shadow/Scalp missiles is also more complex than Atacms, as it requires launching them from an aircraft. Ukraine has previously used its Su-24 bombers to launch these missiles. Savage says that if the targets are deep inside Russia, Ukrainian aircraft will have to approach Russian air defenses on the border, and will need to use jamming and deception to protect themselves.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 21, 2024 10:05 PM\nSource:[masrawy.com](https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_publicaffairs/details/2024/11/21/2679022/%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%AF%D9%85-%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%82-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%B0%D9%84%D9%83-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-#hpLatest)\n\n**What Ukraine can now do with longer-range US missiles**\nThe Biden administration has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles, the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), to strike deeper into Russian territory. The move comes as concern grows in the West that Moscow may be preparing a major counteroffensive to regain lost territory in the Kursk region of Russia. ATACMS have a range of approximately 190 miles, travel at Mach 3, and can carry a heavy payload of up to 500 pounds, making them harder to intercept. The authorization of ATACMS could potentially make a huge difference in the current conflict, allowing Ukraine to conduct deep strikes on Russian territory. The decision also makes it easier for other allies to transfer ATACMS to Ukraine, and could give Ukraine a better hand during negotiations with Russia. According to Benjamin Jensen, a professor at American University, the decision was likely made to disrupt Moscow's operational reach and to offset the advantage given to Russia by North Korean and Russian troops. Jensen also believes that the decision signals that the Biden administration is trying to give Ukraine a better hand during negotiations, and that the conflict may only have until the end of the next campaign season, that is spring to summer 2025, to maintain its position.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 12:37 AM\nSource:[defenseone.com](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/11/what-ukraine-can-now-do-longer-range-us-missiles-and-how-could-affect-course-war/401175/?oref=d1-homepage-river)\n\n**US Decision to Allow Ukraine to Strike Deep into Russia: A Partial Solution**\nThe US decision to allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russia is a palliative measure, providing only partial assistance. The US has a shortage of ATACMS missiles, with only around 1,000 units available, and it's unclear how many have been used. The UK and France have also been considering similar measures, but their decisions are not yet officially confirmed. Ukraine should push for a comprehensive support package, including not only ATACMS but also Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) rockets, which have a longer range. The ability to strike deep into Russia would allow Ukraine to target command centers, troop concentrations, and logistics hubs, giving them a significant advantage in the war of logistics. This decision is more of a political gesture than a practical one, aimed at pressuring Germany and other European countries to provide similar support. If Germany changes its government in 2025, Ukraine may have a better chance of getting German missiles. Ukraine should also insist on receiving not only ATACMS but also PrSM rockets, which have a longer range and are more suitable for F-16 aircraft. The US decision will provide significant support to the Kursk operation, but it's unclear when Ukraine will be able to use the ATACMS missiles, as it's unclear when they will be delivered. Russia's response to the US decision will likely be limited to rhetoric and threats, as they have already used all available options.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 10:00 AM\nSource:[glavred.info](https://opinions.glavred.info/razreshenie-ssha-bit-vglub-rossii-razblokiruet-analogichnye-resheniya-stran-evropy-10615658.html)\n\n**Ukraine May Run Out of ATACMS Missiles by End of January 2025, Analyst Warns**\nAccording to military analyst David Axe, Ukraine may run out of American ATACMS missiles by the end of January 2025. In an article for Forbes, Axe writes that the new administration of President Donald Trump will likely cut aid to Ukraine and revoke the permission to use ATACMS on Russian territory. The US may have supplied around 50 ATACMS missiles to Ukrainian forces during the conflict. The use of ATACMS on Russian territory was previously approved by Washington, and Ukraine had long sought such permission from the West. Russia's Ministry of Defense reported that Ukraine used ATACMS for the first time in an attack on the Briansk region, with six missiles launched, five of which were shot down and one damaged. Moscow warned that allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory could have serious consequences, and reminded of President Vladimir Putin's statement that such a move would be seen as direct US involvement in the conflict.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 08:15 AM\nSource:[Российская газета](https://rg.ru/2024/11/20/forbes-v-konce-ianvaria-u-kieva-mogut-zakonchitsia-rakety-atacms.html)\n\n**Ukraine's ATACMS Stockpile May Run Out by January 2025, Analyst Warns**\nAccording to military analyst David Axe, Ukraine's stockpile of ATACMS missiles may run out by the end of January 2025. Axe, writing for Forbes, suggests that this could be due to two possible events: Ukraine running out of ATACMS or the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump cutting or halting US aid to Ukraine. Trump may also revoke Ukraine's permission to use ATACMS to strike deep into Russia. Axe estimates that the US may have provided Ukraine with fewer than 50 ATACMS since the start of the conflict, with some already used. He also questions the likelihood of new ATACMS shipments, citing the US military's incomplete transition to their replacement. Russia has already confirmed the use of ATACMS in a strike on the Bryansk region on November 19, and the Federation Council has warned of a response to any further threats. Ukraine had previously received permission from the US to use ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles to strike targets in Russia.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 07:19 AM\nSource:[Lenta.ru](https://lenta.ru/news/2024/11/20/v-ssha-nazvali-vozmozhnye-sroki-okonchaniya-zapasov-raket-atacms-u-kieva/)\n\n**My Take 5 (Edition 31): The week that was in international affairs**\nThe Biden administration has given Ukraine permission to use US-made Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to strike deep inside Russia, a move that will allow Ukrainian forces to target Russian military assets far away from the active frontline. The decision comes after months of asking, and is reportedly in response to Russia's deployment of North Korean troops in the Kursk theatre. Ukrainian forces are preparing to face a massive assault by Russian and North Korean troops, and are expected to use the ATACMS missile, which has a range of up to 300km, in the Kursk theatre. As this article goes to press, reports are emerging of Ukraine carrying out its first ATACMS strike inside Russia against military targets in the Bryansk region. 'This is a significant boost for Ukraine,' said a source, 'and will allow them to take the fight to the Russians in a way they haven't been able to before.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 04:37 PM\nSource:[The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/talkingturkey/my-take-5-edition-31-the-week-that-was-in-international-affairs/)\n\n**Ukraine's ATACMS Strike: A Message to the West**\nAccording to The New York Times, Ukraine's use of American ATACMS missiles in the Bryansk region is an attempt to demonstrate to its Western allies that further provision of advanced weaponry will be 'worth it' in terms of weakening Russian forces. As the article states, 'Ukraine is trying to show its Western allies that providing more powerful and modern weapons will pay off by weakening Russian forces.' High-ranking US and Ukrainian officials have confirmed that ATACMS missiles were used against Russia. This move comes after Ukraine expressed dissatisfaction with the decision to allow strikes deep within Russian territory. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had previously stated that the use of ATACMS missiles in the Bryansk region would be a signal that the West wants escalation, and Russia will respond accordingly to the US decision to allow Ukraine to strike deep within Russian territory.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 02:24 PM\nSource:[������.Ru](https://www.gazeta.ru/politics/news/2024/11/19/24423019.shtml)\n\n**What Ukraine can now do with longer-range US missiles - and how that could affect the course of the war**\nThe Biden administration has authorized Ukraine to use longer-range US missiles, specifically the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), to strike deeper into Russian territory. The ATACMS have a range of approximately 190 miles, travel at Mach 3, and can carry a heavy payload of up to 500 pounds. This could potentially make a huge difference in the current conflict, allowing Ukraine to conduct deep strikes on Russian territory. The authorization comes as Russian troop numbers are being swelled by North Korean fighters, and there are concerns that Moscow might be preparing a major counteroffensive to regain lost territory in the Kursk region of Russia. According to Benjamin Jensen, a professor at American University, the decision to authorize ATACMS was likely made to give Ukraine a better hand during negotiations to end the war, and to offset the advantage given to Russia by North Korean support. The move could signal a transition phase in the conflict, and may indicate that the Biden administration is trying to help Ukraine maintain its position until the end of the next campaign season, which is spring to summer 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 12:50 PM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/what-ukraine-can-now-do-with-longer-range-us-missiles-and-how-that-could-affect-the-course-of-the-war-243991)\n\n**With ‘Moscow in range’, Biden, before his term ends, allows Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia**\nUS President Joe Biden has allowed Ukraine to use the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) supplied by America to strike targets inside Russia, bringing the war to the doorstep of Moscow. This decision, coupled with the possibility of using the longer-range Storm Shadow missile supplied by the United Kingdom, has the potential to significantly alter the dimensions of the nearly three-year old war. Ukraine can now hit areas like Kaluga, a historically and culturally important city just about 150 kms southwest of Moscow, with the ATACMS, which has a range of 300 kms. The Storm Shadow has a range of 550 kms, and several major Russian air bases and military headquarters are potential targets. This decision may have repercussions beyond the battlefield and may enable the longer-range Storm Shadow to be similarly used. 'Moscow would be within range if the European-made missile is launched from north-eastern Ukraine,' according to the article. The ATACMS is a tactical ballistic missile with a range of up to 300 kms and uses various types of conventional warheads.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 09:15 AM\nSource:[tribuneindia.com](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/top-headlines/with-moscow-in-range-biden-before-his-term-ends-allows-ukraine-to-strike-deep-inside-russia/)\n\n**US Authorizes Ukraine to Conduct Deep Strikes in Russia with American Missiles**\nThe US has finally authorized Ukraine to conduct deep strikes in Russia with American missiles, a major strategic shift just weeks before Donald Trump's return to the White House. The decision, made in response to North Korean soldiers' involvement in the conflict, is seen as both too late and too restrictive. The move is more political than military and may help slow down the Russian advance, but it won't change the balance of power on the ground. The US has sent the first ATACMS missiles to Ukraine in the fall of 2023, with the restriction that they could not be used to strike Russia. The Ukrainian military has used them to hit two airbases in occupied territories in the Donbass and in the Azov Sea. A new delivery in the spring included missiles with a longer range (up to 300 km) and more power (capable of penetrating concrete infrastructure). The US has admitted their use in destroying a Russian airbase in Crimea, about 165 km from the Ukrainian front line. The ATACMS have also been used in the Kerch Strait. The decision has been met with a mix of joy and bitterness in Ukraine, with some experts saying it's 'better late than never' but also 'a thousand days too late.' The US has imposed restrictions on the use of the ATACMS, which are guided with high precision to their targets. 'It is very probable that these will be validated by the Americans,' estimates a French military source. The US officials cited by the New York Times say that the missiles must first be used in the Kursk region in Russia, where the Kremlin has massed 50,000 soldiers, including 10,000 North Koreans, to recover the territory controlled by Kiev since its incursion into enemy territory on August 6. But they also say that Joe Biden could 'authorize their use elsewhere.' 'We don't know if it will be limited to Kursk or if we can use them in other regions,' laments Alexander Khara, a specialist in international relations at the Centre for Defence Strategies, a think tank based in Kiev. He estimates that 'it's a damage control measure rather than a strategic one,' and recognizes the uncertainty about the number of missiles currently held by Ukraine.

The French have reaffirmed that the use of French missiles by Ukrainian forces on Russian soil remains 'an option.' 'You have heard the President Macron, on May 25, in Meseberg [Germany], where we openly said that it was an option we were considering,' said the foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, upon his arrival in Brussels for a meeting of foreign ministers. 'So, nothing new under the sun,' he added. The UK has refused to say if it will follow the US in allowing Ukraine to use its Storm Shadow missiles to strike Russian targets. 'I won't go into operational details, because if we did, the only winner would be Vladimir Putin,' explained the UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer. The UK had mobilized in September to convince the US to allow Ukraine to strike Russian military targets with British-supplied equipment. Keir Starmer had even traveled to Washington to try to win over Joe Biden to his views. The UK needs US approval, which it relies on technologically to program the targeting of its missiles. The German government has reaffirmed that it will not provide Ukraine with the Taurus missiles, capable of striking up to 500 km. 'It's something I cannot and do not want to be responsible for,' insisted Chancellor Olaf Scholz from Rio. According to him, such a delivery would not be 'correct.' His priority is to avoid escalation with a nuclear-armed power. A message repeated before the collapse of his coalition, against the advice of his partners, the liberals of the FDP and the Greens, who were in favor of delivering Taurus. Berlin has, however, announced the provision of 4,000 sophisticated drones to Ukraine. Italy will not follow the US in allowing Ukraine to use its missiles to strike Russian targets. 'Our position on the use of arms by Ukraine does not change, they can only be used within Ukrainian territory,' assured Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, on the sidelines of a meeting with his European counterparts. Beyond military considerations, the approach of Ukraine's allies is above all political. While countries in the South - China and Brazil in the lead - are multiplying calls to negotiate to end the war at the G20, the West is mainly seeking to prolong its military support to Ukraine to put it in a better position before any potential negotiations - if Putin agrees to discuss without demanding Kiev's surrender. 'We must redouble our efforts and ensure that Ukraine has what it needs as long as necessary,' emphasized Keir Starmer, in Rio, 'because we cannot allow Putin to win this war.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 04:47 AM\nSource:[Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2024/11/19/guerre-en-ukraine-le-revirement-americain-sur-les-frappes-en-profondeur-juge-trop-tardif_6401950_3210.html)\n\n**US Allows Ukraine to Use American-Made Weapons to Attack Russian Deep Targets**\nThe US has allowed Ukraine to use American-made weapons, including the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), to attack Russian deep targets. This marks a significant shift in US policy on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, just two months before the Democratic Party's government leaves office. The move has been met with warnings from Russia that it will be seen as a direct involvement of NATO countries in the conflict, leading to a severe escalation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said, 'Today, many media outlets reported that we have been given permission to take 'appropriate action.' However, implementing a strike is not just about saying it. This thing won't be announced. The missiles will speak for themselves.' The US has been hesitant to allow Ukraine to use American-made weapons to attack Russian deep targets, but has gradually relaxed its restrictions. In October last year, the US agreed to provide ATACMS missiles with a range of 165 kilometers, and in January this year, it began shipping ATACMS missiles with a range of 300 kilometers. Some US officials have expressed doubts about whether allowing Ukraine to use long-range weapons to attack Russian territory would affect the overall trajectory of the conflict. According to Reuters, Russia currently has the upper hand on the battlefield, and all parties are urging Russia and Ukraine to start peace talks as soon as possible. If talks are initiated, the US move may increase Ukraine's bargaining power.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 12:57 AM\nSource:[人民网](http://world.people.com.cn/n1/2024/1119/c1002-40364413.html)\n\n**US Allows Ukraine to Use 'Atacms' Missiles to Strike Deep into Russia**\nThe US has allowed Ukraine to use 'Atacms' missiles, produced by the US, to strike deep into Russia, a significant shift in Washington's policy in the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv. According to sources, Ukraine plans to launch its first long-range attacks in the coming days, without revealing details due to security concerns. The 'Atacms' missiles have different types, including those with varying amounts of cluster bombs. The Ukrainian forces used the long-range 'Atacms' missiles, supplied by the US, for the first time in October 2023, when President Volodymyr Zelensky said the weapons 'proved themselves.' The US decision to allow Ukraine to use the missiles to strike Russia comes two months before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20, and follows Zelensky's repeated requests over the past months to allow the Ukrainian army to use US-made weapons to strike Russian military targets beyond its borders. A US official and the source familiar with the decision said the change comes largely in response to Russia's deployment of ground troops from North Korea to support its forces, a development that has raised concerns in Washington and Kyiv. Ukraine likely has 'Atacms' missiles of the 'M39A1 Block IA' type, which is partially guided by the Global Positioning System (GPS) and has a range of 70 to 300 kilometers. It can carry 300 small bombs. According to US military documents, the 'M39A1 Block' missiles were used in the invasion of Iraq and entered the US arsenal in 1997. Ukraine also likely has 'Atacms' missiles of the 'M57' type, which carries a single high-explosive warhead weighing 230 kilograms and has a range of 70 to 300 kilometers. The 'M57' missiles were first used in 2004 and have been used in many conflicts, including Operation Enduring Freedom. The comparison between these missiles and other ones in Ukraine's arsenal is that France and Britain have provided 'Scalp' and 'Storm Shadow' missiles, but neither government has explained whether they will follow the US in allowing Ukraine to use these missiles, which have a range of 250 kilometers, to strike targets beyond its borders. Ukraine will now, with US permission, be able to strike targets deep in Russia, likely in the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces still control large areas of territory and reports have indicated that North Korean troops are concentrated there. In August, analysts at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said hundreds of known Russian military targets are within the range of 'Atacms' missiles. However, it is likely that some military assets have been moved to deeper Russia despite logistical challenges in anticipation of the US decision.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 18, 2024 10:13 PM\nSource:[annaharar.com](https://www.annahar.com/international/Europe/172326/%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%87%D9%8A-%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D8%A3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%83%D9%85%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D9%82%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%AF%D9%85%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%B6%D8%AF-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7)\n\n**What to know about ATACMS, US missiles that may be used in Russia**\nThe US has allowed Ukraine to use ATACMS missiles to strike deep into Russia, a significant reversal of Washington's policy in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

A longer-range version, with a maximum range of 300 km, was provided in early 2024. With US authorization, Ukraine will now be able to strike targets inside Russia, likely around the Koursk region, where Ukrainian forces still hold territory and where North Korean troops are concentrated.

According to officials speaking to the New York Times, this decision does not significantly change the course of the war, but it does send a message to North Korea that its army is vulnerable. 'We have given the green light to the use of long-range missiles,' said a source close to the administration. 'These missiles will be used to hit sites that are important to the Russian army, such as logistics sites and airfields.' Donald Trump, who is set to return to the White House in January, has been critical of the billions of dollars in aid sent to Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion in 2022. 'Either the incoming administration will approve and extend the authorization given by the Biden administration, in order to show Putin that they will not let Ukraine negotiate peace in a position of weakness, or Trump will revoke this authorization and it will be very difficult to deny an alignment with Putin's and Russia's best interests,' said Corentin Sellin, a specialist on the US.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 17, 2024 07:30 PM\nSource:[huffingtonpost.fr](https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/international/article/guerre-en-ukraine-biden-dit-enfin-oui-a-l-utilisation-de-missiles-longue-portee-occidentaux-par-kiev_242352.html)\n\n**Putin Warns of NATO Involvement if Ukraine Strikes Deep into Russia**\nAccording to 'Kommercsant', Russian President Vladimir Putin stated in September that allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory with long-range artillery would be equivalent to direct NATO involvement in the conflict. The US government has declined to comment on the decision to allow Ukraine to use ATACMS long-range missiles to strike deep into Russian territory. The ATACMS missiles, produced in the US, are likely to be used initially against Russian and North Korean forces to protect Ukrainian military units in the Kursk region of western Russia. US President Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use ATACMS missiles for the first time, a move that was made just two months before the change of power in Washington and is considered a 'significant shift in US policy'. The decision has sparked divided opinions among Biden's advisors.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 17, 2024 07:07 PM\nSource:[Вечерняя Москва](https://vm.ru/news/1183753-smi-putin-govoril-chto-udary-vglub-rf-znachat-pryamoe-uchastie-nato-v-konflikte)\n\n**Ukraine May Use ATACMS Missiles to Strike Deep into Russia**\nAccording to sources, Ukraine may use ATACMS missiles, with a range of up to 190 miles (306 km), to strike deep into Russia after receiving permission from the US. The first strikes could occur in the coming days, sources told Reuters. The US decision, which was also reported by The New York Times, is a response to the presence of North Korean soldiers in the Kursk region, which is partially under Ukrainian control. Russia and North Korea signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement in 2024, which includes a provision that requires both countries to provide military assistance to each other in case of an attack. However, Russia claims that the agreement does not violate international law. President Vladimir Putin warned in August that if Ukraine is allowed to use long-range missiles on Russian territory, it would be equivalent to NATO and European countries declaring war on Russia. 'This would mean that countries of NATO, the US, and European countries are at war with Russia,' Putin said. 'We will take the necessary decisions.'

The company's data center business, which includes sales of components used to power AI technologies, reported $30.8 billion in revenue, surpassing analyst expectations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that production of the new Blackwell chips is 'in full steam,' addressing earlier concerns about potential delays. However, investor worries heightened after reports of Blackwell chips overheating in some data center racks, which Nvidia attributed to 'normal and expected' customer configuration adjustments. Nvidia's Q4 guidance points to approximately 70% growth, a significant slowdown compared to last year's 265% annual growth.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 21, 2024 04:34 PM\nSource:[forexlive.com](https://www.forexlive.com/Education/age-of-ai-nvidias-explosive-earnings-20241121/)\n\n**The 2 reasons why Nvidia will keep outperforming: Analyst**\nNvidia (NVDA) posted a 94% year-over-year revenue growth in its fiscal third quarter, but the stock price did not increase.

JPMorgan analysts raised their target price from $155 to $170, citing the 'progressing well' Blackwell production. Goldman Sachs lifted its price objective on NVDA from $150 to $165, despite near-term gross margin headwinds, due to 'growing demand for AI infrastructure' and improving supply trends.

Analysts also predict that the company's net profit will exceed $100 billion in just two years, making it one of the five companies in the world to achieve this milestone by 2026. As one analyst from JP Morgan noted, 'We expect Nvidia to continue to perform well across all segments, with strong demand for PC games driving revenue, offsetting the decline in OEM sales. We are also encouraged by the solid performance in the automotive and commercial segments. We expect a significant increase in the stock price, leading to our overweight rating.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 08:53 PM\nSource:[nouvelles-du-monde.com](https://www.nouvelles-du-monde.com/nvidia-depasse-apple-en-capitalisation-et-devient-le-plus-grand-cote-avant-de-presenter-ses-resultats/)\n\n**Nvidia market cap closing in on $3.5 trillion: Will it surpass Apple soon?**\nNvidia's market capitalization is closing in on $3.5 trillion, with the company adding over $3 trillion since the AI boom began in late 2022. Nvidia's dominance in the AI market is due to its superior technology, with its chips being 25 times more profitable than its closest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices. The company is committed to updating its chips every year, and its new Blackwell chips are already in high demand, with analysts projecting $10 billion in added revenue before the end of the year. Meanwhile, Apple is experiencing growing pains, with reports of less-than-stellar sales of its latest iPhone model. As a result, Nvidia is expected to pull ahead and take the lead position in the race for the world's largest market cap.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2024 01:50 PM\nSource:[USA Today](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/10/21/nvidia-market-cap-nearing-3-5-trillion-apple/75772989007/)\n\n**Will Nvidia Be a $10 Trillion Stock by 2029?**\nNvidia's market capitalization has tripled three times in the past six years, and the company is on the verge of tripling its market cap again. With a current market cap of $3.2 trillion, Nvidia is one of the largest companies in the world. The company's end markets are growing rapidly, with AI chip demand expected to rise 33% in 2024 and 20% annually over the next five years. Nvidia has a stranglehold on the market with an estimated 88% share of GPU spending. Wall Street analysts are forecasting 52.5% annual sales growth for Nvidia over the next five years. While Nvidia's premium valuation is high, the company's rapid growth may justify it. If Nvidia lives up to analysts' expectations, the company could report $794 billion in revenue by 2029 and approach a $10 trillion market cap.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 01:00 PM\nSource:[fool.com](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/10/will-nvidia-be-a-10-trillion-dollar-stock-by-2029/)\n\n**Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?**\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is rapidly closing the gap with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in terms of valuation, with a market cap of $3.13 trillion compared to Apple's $3.37 trillion. While Apple's revenue is significantly higher at $385 billion, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue, with a 122% year-over-year increase in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Nvidia's growth potential is driven by its graphics processing units (GPUs) powering the AI revolution, and its upcoming Blackwell architecture, which is expected to unlock massive speed gains. Analysts believe Nvidia's revenue will grow around 42% next year, far outpacing Apple's projections of 8% growth. However, Nvidia still generates about half the profits of Apple, but with its growth pace and stronger profit margin, it could quickly catch Apple's profit levels. By the end of the next fiscal year, Nvidia could be right there with Apple in terms of profits. Next comes valuation, where Nvidia's strong growth and brand could fetch a higher premium than Apple, potentially propelling it to overtake Apple as the world's largest company.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 10:51 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The movie is a prequel and sequel to The Lion King, and is set to be released on the same weekend as Star Wars and Avatar films. Mufasa: The Lion King is tracking well with female audience members and older moviegoers, and is expected to tap into the nostalgia of those who have fond memories of the 1994 animated The Lion King.

The movie is estimated to start with a US box office of $59-66 million, significantly lower than the success of the 2019 'The Lion King' remake, which started with $190 million and grossed $1.6 billion worldwide. The low expectations are attributed to Disney's focus on promoting 'Moana 2' and the fact that prequels often fail to match the success of their originals. Additionally, 'Mufasa' will be competing with 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3', which also targets a young audience. Analysts suggest that parents choosing a family movie will be influenced by their children's preferences and personal interests, with 'The Lion King' having a larger female fan base and 'Sonic' appealing more to men.

The new trailer showcases the film's grandeur, and considering the success of the first part, it's possible that the prequel about Mufasa will become the most successful family film in Disney's history. The unique aspect of the new versions of 'The Lion King' is that they differentiate themselves from the originals through modern re-imaginings while still capturing the magic of the world. The film is a 'live-action' remake with computer-generated characters, which may seem like a contradiction, but has proven to be a genius decision. A 3D animated remake would have lost the film's charm, and a live-action version with animated animal faces would have been quirky rather than enchanting. The new look and aesthetic of the film are both majestic and organic, setting it apart from Hollywood's generic style.

According to Deadline, Adam Aron, CEO of AMC Theatres, is convinced that the upcoming releases of 'Vaiana 2', 'Wicked', and 'Mufasa: El Rey León' will push the US box office revenue for 2024 to over $9 billion. He also stated, 'Some people who know the topic tell me that 'Vaiana 2' could even eclipse the success of 'Del revés 2'. This would mean surpassing the $653 million achieved by the sequel of 'Inside Out' in the domestic market, with $154.2 million of them in its opening weekend, making it the second-best release of the year, just behind 'Deadpool y Lobezno', which made $211.4 million in its first weekend. The predictions were already good, with forecasts of $100 million in domestic box office revenue in the first 5 days of 'Vaiana 2', surpassing the $82 million achieved by the original in 2016.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 10:20 AM\nSource:[ecartelera.com](https://www.ecartelera.com/noticias/vaiana-2-podria-superar-exito-delreves-2-78876/)\n\n**What Venom 3's Box Office Means For Sony's Next 2024 Marvel Movie**\nVenom: The Last Dance's box office performance suggests that Sony's next Marvel movie, Kraven the Hunter, has a chance to be successful. Despite a disappointing opening weekend, the film is holding up better than expected in its second weekend, earning $26.1 million and topping the weekend box office charts. The film's success is a positive sign for the Sony Spider-Man Universe, which has been a mixed bag since 2018's Venom. However, Kraven the Hunter faces tough competition during the holiday season, including The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim and Mufasa: The Lion King. The film's R rating could also affect its box office, as families are looking for family-friendly entertainment during the holidays. Nevertheless, Kraven the Hunter has a talented cast and crew, and positive word-of-mouth could help it perform well at the box office.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 12:33 PM\nSource:[ScreenRant](https://screenrant.com/venom-3-box-office-kraven-the-hunter-2024-marvel-movie/)\n\n**Imax Forecasts Record $1.2B in Global Box Office in 2025**\nImax reported a revenue of $91.5 million for the third quarter, down 12 percent from the same period last year.
