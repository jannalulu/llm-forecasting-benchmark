**US, UK, and France Allow Ukraine to Use Long-Range Missiles, Russia Sees 'New Escalation'**
The decision by US President Joe Biden to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles is linked to the victory of Donald Trump in the elections, as well as the advancement of Russian troops, according to Reuters and The Times, citing sources. The sources stated that the involvement of North Korean soldiers in the conflict in the Kursk region 'became a serious escalation' that required a response. However, it's not just about this. Trump's election, who 'is extremely skeptical about US support for Ukraine', forced the Biden administration to take additional steps to support Kyiv, explained two sources from Reuters. 'Territorial successes of Russia in Ukraine accelerated in 2024, - quotes The Times from a briefing of the British military intelligence. - The front line is now less stable than ever since the start of the conflict.' The removal of restrictions on British Storm Shadow missiles striking Russian territory indicates an attempt by the UK to stop the advancement of Russian forces in Ukraine, according to the article. 'It was a great day', said no one, but the situation is serious. The US, UK, and France have allowed Ukraine to use long-range missiles, which Russia considers a 'new escalation'. President Vladimir Putin warned in September about possible retaliatory measures in case of the West's permission to use long-range missiles by Ukraine. This would mean that 'NATO countries, the US, and European countries are at war with Russia', he noted. Putin applied a ballistic missile 'Orekh' to strike an object in Dnipro in response to Ukrainian attacks on November 21. Ukraine has already been using western weapons to strike deep into Russia, acknowledged the head of the Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate, Kirill Budanov, in the summer. The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, said in May that American weapons were already being used to strike beyond the combat zone. During the invasion of the Kursk region, Ukrainian forces used British Challenger 2 tanks, reported Sky News. The use of western weapons in the Kursk border area was also mentioned by the Russian deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky. The Russian Ministry of Defense has repeatedly reported attempts to attack Crimea with British Storm Shadow missiles. The city of Belgorod was also hit with Czech-made RM-70 Vampire rocket launchers.

**US Explains Biden's Decision on Strikes**
According to Reuters, Joe Biden's decision to allow NATO to strike deep into Russian territory using missiles may be an attempt to make parts of his Ukrainian agenda 'Trump-proof'. 'This decision may help make parts of Biden's Ukrainian agenda 'Trump-proof', ' Reuters quotes an anonymous US official as saying. However, some American analysts believe that this decision will delay the process of peaceful negotiations with Russia. Previously, 'SP' reported that China is willing to work with all parties to build a fair peace.

**Ukraine Uses Western-Made Missiles to Strike Deep into Russia, Changing the Course of the War**
Ukraine has used Western-made missiles to strike deep into Russia, a move that could change the course of the war. According to Russia, Ukrainian forces have launched US-made 'Atacms' missiles into Russian territory, just days after receiving permission from the White House. The missiles have reportedly damaged a military facility in Bryansk, Russia, about 100 kilometers from the border. Sources close to the BBC say that British-made 'Storm Shadow' missiles, supplied to Ukraine, have also been used against targets inside Russia. BBC defense correspondent Jonathan Beale said, 'A few months ago, a defense source told me that the first time we would know that British-made Storm Shadow missiles had been used to strike targets inside Russia would be after it had happened.' US President Joe Biden had previously banned Ukraine from using long-range missiles, supplied by the US, to strike targets inside Russia, fearing escalation. However, France may also allow Ukrainian forces to launch 'Scalp' missiles, a French-made equivalent of the Storm Shadow, against Russia. There are hundreds of military targets inside western Russia that Ukrainian forces could strike, according to the American research center, the Institute for the Study of War. However, military analysts warn that using missiles to strike targets inside Russia may not be effective for Ukraine, as the targets they want to strike have been moved further away from the range of those missiles. The Atacms missile system is a US-made ballistic missile launched from the ground, using mobile launchers such as the HIMARS and HIMARS, both of which have been supplied to Ukraine. The maximum range of the Atacms missile is 300 kilometers, and it flies at a speed of three times the speed of sound, entering service in the US in 1986. It can carry two types of munitions: one is a single high-explosive warhead with a maximum weight of 220 kg, and the other contains clusters of small bombs that disperse upon impact over a wide area. Storm Shadow is a guided missile designed by France and Britain jointly. It flies at low altitude at speeds exceeding 965 km/h, following the curvature of the Earth before rising and impacting vertically on its target. It was designed to penetrate hardened targets such as underground bunkers, using 'primary material' that expels hot metal through the wall, followed by a bomb that explodes inside. Both Atacms and Storm Shadow/Scalp are high-precision guided missiles. Ukrainian forces have used Atacms for over a year against Russian forces inside Ukraine and against Russian bases near the border, used to launch attacks on Ukrainian territory. US President Biden had feared that using the missiles against targets inside Russia would escalate the conflict, drawing the US into war. On November 19, two days after Biden's easing of this restriction, Ukrainian forces launched missiles on a munitions depot in Karachiv in the Bryansk region of Russia, about 100 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, northeast of Kiev. Ukrainian forces did not specify the type of missile used, but US officials confirmed it was an Atacms. Russia said its air defenses intercepted five missiles, with one causing damage. US officials said Russia may have intercepted only two of the eight missiles. Russia warned of a 'suitable and tangible' response to the use of missiles on targets inside its territory. The Russian Foreign Ministry said, 'The use of Kiev's long-range missiles to attack our territory will constitute a direct US involvement in the hostilities against Russia, as well as a fundamental change in the nature and essence of the conflict.' The new policy was formulated by the White House as a measure to support Ukrainian forces inside Russia, which currently occupy about 500 square kilometers of territory in the Kursk region, expected to face a counterattack from Russian and North Korean forces. The arrival of around 10,000 North Korean special forces in Russia to fight against Ukraine is believed to have contributed to Biden's change of heart. The Institute for the Study of War identified 245 military facilities inside Russia within the range of Atacms missile strikes, including 16 airbases. Because it can cause explosions over a wide area, the cluster bomb warhead can be used effectively against concentrations of troops and aircraft, which are exposed in the open at airbases. The impact of Atacms missile strikes on the Russian military may be limited, according to Matthew Savage of the Royal United Services Institute, who knows the acronym 'Russia' and is based in Britain. Ukraine is eager to destroy Russian aircraft that launch cruise missiles and glide bombs against its forces on the front lines and against civilian infrastructure such as power plants. However, Savage says, 'Many of the best targets - helicopters and aircraft armed with glide bombs, which attack cities and Ukrainian forces in the north or in Kursk - have been moved to airbases outside the range of Atacms missile strikes... Some of these aircraft are based over 1,000 kilometers from Ukraine.' For months, Ukraine has asked Britain and France to allow it to launch Storm Shadow/Scalp missiles against targets inside Russia. In the past, its forces have used these missiles against targets in occupied Crimea - for example, against the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol. Jonathan Beale, BBC defense correspondent, says that the US decision to allow Ukraine to use Atacms missiles against targets inside Russia paves the way for Britain and France to follow the same approach with Storm Shadow/Scalp missiles. Storm Shadow/Scalp missiles differ from Atacms in that they are designed to attack hardened targets such as underground bunkers. Unlike Atacms, they cannot cause damage over a wide area. Savage says they are therefore 'not very useful against exposed forces or aircraft in the open at airbases.' He says, 'The Ukrainians will be looking for the best hardened targets, such as ammunition depots or fortified headquarters, and we should not expect to see a large number of Storm Shadow strikes anytime soon.' Launching Storm Shadow/Scalp missiles is also more complex than Atacms, as it requires launching them from an aircraft. Ukraine has previously used its Su-24 bombers to launch these missiles. Savage says that if the targets are deep inside Russia, Ukrainian aircraft will have to approach Russian air defenses on the border, and will need to use jamming and deception to protect themselves.

**What Ukraine can now do with longer-range US missiles**
The Biden administration has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles, the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), to strike deeper into Russian territory. The move comes as concern grows in the West that Moscow may be preparing a major counteroffensive to regain lost territory in the Kursk region of Russia. ATACMS have a range of approximately 190 miles, travel at Mach 3, and can carry a heavy payload of up to 500 pounds, making them harder to intercept. The authorization of ATACMS could potentially make a huge difference in the current conflict, allowing Ukraine to conduct deep strikes on Russian territory. The decision also makes it easier for other allies to transfer ATACMS to Ukraine, and could give Ukraine a better hand during negotiations with Russia. According to Benjamin Jensen, a professor at American University, the decision was likely made to disrupt Moscow's operational reach and to offset the advantage given to Russia by North Korean and Russian troops. Jensen also believes that the decision signals that the Biden administration is trying to give Ukraine a better hand during negotiations, and that the conflict may only have until the end of the next campaign season, that is spring to summer 2025, to maintain its position.

**US Decision to Allow Ukraine to Strike Deep into Russia: A Partial Solution**
The US decision to allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russia is a palliative measure, providing only partial assistance. The US has a shortage of ATACMS missiles, with only around 1,000 units available, and it's unclear how many have been used. The UK and France have also been considering similar measures, but their decisions are not yet officially confirmed. Ukraine should push for a comprehensive support package, including not only ATACMS but also Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) rockets, which have a longer range. The ability to strike deep into Russia would allow Ukraine to target command centers, troop concentrations, and logistics hubs, giving them a significant advantage in the war of logistics. This decision is more of a political gesture than a practical one, aimed at pressuring Germany and other European countries to provide similar support. If Germany changes its government in 2025, Ukraine may have a better chance of getting German missiles. Ukraine should also insist on receiving not only ATACMS but also PrSM rockets, which have a longer range and are more suitable for F-16 aircraft. The US decision will provide significant support to the Kursk operation, but it's unclear when Ukraine will be able to use the ATACMS missiles, as it's unclear when they will be delivered. Russia's response to the US decision will likely be limited to rhetoric and threats, as they have already used all available options.

**Ukraine May Run Out of ATACMS Missiles by End of January 2025, Analyst Warns**
According to military analyst David Axe, Ukraine may run out of American ATACMS missiles by the end of January 2025. In an article for Forbes, Axe writes that the new administration of President Donald Trump will likely cut aid to Ukraine and revoke the permission to use ATACMS on Russian territory. The US may have supplied around 50 ATACMS missiles to Ukrainian forces during the conflict. The use of ATACMS on Russian territory was previously approved by Washington, and Ukraine had long sought such permission from the West. Russia's Ministry of Defense reported that Ukraine used ATACMS for the first time in an attack on the Briansk region, with six missiles launched, five of which were shot down and one damaged. Moscow warned that allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory could have serious consequences, and reminded of President Vladimir Putin's statement that such a move would be seen as direct US involvement in the conflict.

**Ukraine's ATACMS Stockpile May Run Out by January 2025, Analyst Warns**
According to military analyst David Axe, Ukraine's stockpile of ATACMS missiles may run out by the end of January 2025. Axe, writing for Forbes, suggests that this could be due to two possible events: Ukraine running out of ATACMS or the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump cutting or halting US aid to Ukraine. Trump may also revoke Ukraine's permission to use ATACMS to strike deep into Russia. Axe estimates that the US may have provided Ukraine with fewer than 50 ATACMS since the start of the conflict, with some already used. He also questions the likelihood of new ATACMS shipments, citing the US military's incomplete transition to their replacement. Russia has already confirmed the use of ATACMS in a strike on the Bryansk region on November 19, and the Federation Council has warned of a response to any further threats. Ukraine had previously received permission from the US to use ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles to strike targets in Russia.

**My Take 5 (Edition 31): The week that was in international affairs**
The Biden administration has given Ukraine permission to use US-made Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to strike deep inside Russia, a move that will allow Ukrainian forces to target Russian military assets far away from the active frontline. The decision comes after months of asking, and is reportedly in response to Russia's deployment of North Korean troops in the Kursk theatre. Ukrainian forces are preparing to face a massive assault by Russian and North Korean troops, and are expected to use the ATACMS missile, which has a range of up to 300km, in the Kursk theatre. As this article goes to press, reports are emerging of Ukraine carrying out its first ATACMS strike inside Russia against military targets in the Bryansk region. 'This is a significant boost for Ukraine,' said a source, 'and will allow them to take the fight to the Russians in a way they haven't been able to before.'

**Ukraine's ATACMS Strike: A Message to the West**
According to The New York Times, Ukraine's use of American ATACMS missiles in the Bryansk region is an attempt to demonstrate to its Western allies that further provision of advanced weaponry will be 'worth it' in terms of weakening Russian forces. As the article states, 'Ukraine is trying to show its Western allies that providing more powerful and modern weapons will pay off by weakening Russian forces.' High-ranking US and Ukrainian officials have confirmed that ATACMS missiles were used against Russia. This move comes after Ukraine expressed dissatisfaction with the decision to allow strikes deep within Russian territory. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had previously stated that the use of ATACMS missiles in the Bryansk region would be a signal that the West wants escalation, and Russia will respond accordingly to the US decision to allow Ukraine to strike deep within Russian territory.

**With ‘Moscow in range’, Biden, before his term ends, allows Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia**
US President Joe Biden has allowed Ukraine to use the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) supplied by America to strike targets inside Russia, bringing the war to the doorstep of Moscow. This decision, coupled with the possibility of using the longer-range Storm Shadow missile supplied by the United Kingdom, has the potential to significantly alter the dimensions of the nearly three-year old war. Ukraine can now hit areas like Kaluga, a historically and culturally important city just about 150 kms southwest of Moscow, with the ATACMS, which has a range of 300 kms. The Storm Shadow has a range of 550 kms, and several major Russian air bases and military headquarters are potential targets. This decision may have repercussions beyond the battlefield and may enable the longer-range Storm Shadow to be similarly used. 'Moscow would be within range if the European-made missile is launched from north-eastern Ukraine,' according to the article. The ATACMS is a tactical ballistic missile with a range of up to 300 kms and uses various types of conventional warheads.

**US Authorizes Ukraine to Conduct Deep Strikes in Russia with American Missiles**
The US has finally authorized Ukraine to conduct deep strikes in Russia with American missiles, a major strategic shift just weeks before Donald Trump's return to the White House. The decision, made in response to North Korean soldiers' involvement in the conflict, is seen as both too late and too restrictive. The move is more political than military and may help slow down the Russian advance, but it won't change the balance of power on the ground. The US has sent the first ATACMS missiles to Ukraine in the fall of 2023, with the restriction that they could not be used to strike Russia. The Ukrainian military has used them to hit two airbases in occupied territories in the Donbass and in the Azov Sea. A new delivery in the spring included missiles with a longer range (up to 300 km) and more power (capable of penetrating concrete infrastructure). The US has admitted their use in destroying a Russian airbase in Crimea, about 165 km from the Ukrainian front line. The ATACMS have also been used in the Kerch Strait. The decision has been met with a mix of joy and bitterness in Ukraine, with some experts saying it's 'better late than never' but also 'a thousand days too late.' The US has imposed restrictions on the use of the ATACMS, which are guided with high precision to their targets. 'It is very probable that these will be validated by the Americans,' estimates a French military source. The US officials cited by the New York Times say that the missiles must first be used in the Kursk region in Russia, where the Kremlin has massed 50,000 soldiers, including 10,000 North Koreans, to recover the territory controlled by Kiev since its incursion into enemy territory on August 6. But they also say that Joe Biden could 'authorize their use elsewhere.' 'We don't know if it will be limited to Kursk or if we can use them in other regions,' laments Alexander Khara, a specialist in international relations at the Centre for Defence Strategies, a think tank based in Kiev. He estimates that 'it's a damage control measure rather than a strategic one,' and recognizes the uncertainty about the number of missiles currently held by Ukraine.

He estimates that 'it's a damage control measure rather than a strategic one,' and recognizes the uncertainty about the number of missiles currently held by Ukraine. The French have reaffirmed that the use of French missiles by Ukrainian forces on Russian soil remains 'an option.' 'You have heard the President Macron, on May 25, in Meseberg [Germany], where we openly said that it was an option we were considering,' said the foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, upon his arrival in Brussels for a meeting of foreign ministers. 'So, nothing new under the sun,' he added. The UK has refused to say if it will follow the US in allowing Ukraine to use its Storm Shadow missiles to strike Russian targets. 'I won't go into operational details, because if we did, the only winner would be Vladimir Putin,' explained the UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer. The UK had mobilized in September to convince the US to allow Ukraine to strike Russian military targets with British-supplied equipment. Keir Starmer had even traveled to Washington to try to win over Joe Biden to his views. The UK needs US approval, which it relies on technologically to program the targeting of its missiles. The German government has reaffirmed that it will not provide Ukraine with the Taurus missiles, capable of striking up to 500 km. 'It's something I cannot and do not want to be responsible for,' insisted Chancellor Olaf Scholz from Rio. According to him, such a delivery would not be 'correct.' His priority is to avoid escalation with a nuclear-armed power. A message repeated before the collapse of his coalition, against the advice of his partners, the liberals of the FDP and the Greens, who were in favor of delivering Taurus. Berlin has, however, announced the provision of 4,000 sophisticated drones to Ukraine. Italy will not follow the US in allowing Ukraine to use its missiles to strike Russian targets. 'Our position on the use of arms by Ukraine does not change, they can only be used within Ukrainian territory,' assured Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, on the sidelines of a meeting with his European counterparts. Beyond military considerations, the approach of Ukraine's allies is above all political. While countries in the South - China and Brazil in the lead - are multiplying calls to negotiate to end the war at the G20, the West is mainly seeking to prolong its military support to Ukraine to put it in a better position before any potential negotiations - if Putin agrees to discuss without demanding Kiev's surrender. 'We must redouble our efforts and ensure that Ukraine has what it needs as long as necessary,' emphasized Keir Starmer, in Rio, 'because we cannot allow Putin to win this war.'

**US Allows Ukraine to Use American-Made Weapons to Attack Russian Deep Targets**
The US has allowed Ukraine to use American-made weapons, including the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), to attack Russian deep targets. This marks a significant shift in US policy on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, just two months before the Democratic Party's government leaves office. The move has been met with warnings from Russia that it will be seen as a direct involvement of NATO countries in the conflict, leading to a severe escalation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said, 'Today, many media outlets reported that we have been given permission to take 'appropriate action.' However, implementing a strike is not just about saying it. This thing won't be announced. The missiles will speak for themselves.' The US has been hesitant to allow Ukraine to use American-made weapons to attack Russian deep targets, but has gradually relaxed its restrictions. In October last year, the US agreed to provide ATACMS missiles with a range of 165 kilometers, and in January this year, it began shipping ATACMS missiles with a range of 300 kilometers. Some US officials have expressed doubts about whether allowing Ukraine to use long-range weapons to attack Russian territory would affect the overall trajectory of the conflict. According to Reuters, Russia currently has the upper hand on the battlefield, and all parties are urging Russia and Ukraine to start peace talks as soon as possible. If talks are initiated, the US move may increase Ukraine's bargaining power.

**US Allows Ukraine to Use 'Atacms' Missiles to Strike Deep into Russia**
The US has allowed Ukraine to use 'Atacms' missiles, produced by the US, to strike deep into Russia, a significant shift in Washington's policy in the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv. According to sources, Ukraine plans to launch its first long-range attacks in the coming days, without revealing details due to security concerns. The 'Atacms' missiles have different types, including those with varying amounts of cluster bombs. The Ukrainian forces used the long-range 'Atacms' missiles, supplied by the US, for the first time in October 2023, when President Volodymyr Zelensky said the weapons 'proved themselves.' The US decision to allow Ukraine to use the missiles to strike Russia comes two months before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20, and follows Zelensky's repeated requests over the past months to allow the Ukrainian army to use US-made weapons to strike Russian military targets beyond its borders. A US official and the source familiar with the decision said the change comes largely in response to Russia's deployment of ground troops from North Korea to support its forces, a development that has raised concerns in Washington and Kyiv. Ukraine likely has 'Atacms' missiles of the 'M39A1 Block IA' type, which is partially guided by the Global Positioning System (GPS) and has a range of 70 to 300 kilometers. It can carry 300 small bombs. According to US military documents, the 'M39A1 Block' missiles were used in the invasion of Iraq and entered the US arsenal in 1997. Ukraine also likely has 'Atacms' missiles of the 'M57' type, which carries a single high-explosive warhead weighing 230 kilograms and has a range of 70 to 300 kilometers. The 'M57' missiles were first used in 2004 and have been used in many conflicts, including Operation Enduring Freedom. The comparison between these missiles and other ones in Ukraine's arsenal is that France and Britain have provided 'Scalp' and 'Storm Shadow' missiles, but neither government has explained whether they will follow the US in allowing Ukraine to use these missiles, which have a range of 250 kilometers, to strike targets beyond its borders. Ukraine will now, with US permission, be able to strike targets deep in Russia, likely in the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces still control large areas of territory and reports have indicated that North Korean troops are concentrated there. In August, analysts at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said hundreds of known Russian military targets are within the range of 'Atacms' missiles. However, it is likely that some military assets have been moved to deeper Russia despite logistical challenges in anticipation of the US decision.

**What to know about ATACMS, US missiles that may be used in Russia**
The US has allowed Ukraine to use ATACMS missiles to strike deep into Russia, a significant reversal of Washington's policy in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Ukraine plans to conduct its first long-range attacks in the coming days, using missiles that have a range of 70 to 300 km and can carry a payload of 300 bomblets. The decision comes in response to Russia's deployment of North Korean ground troops and follows months of pleas by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to allow Ukraine's military to use U.S. weapons to hit Russian military targets far from its border. Zelenskiy said the ATACMS missiles have 'proven themselves' after being used for the first time in October 2023. The US permission will allow Ukraine to strike targets deep inside Russia, most likely around the Kursk region, where Kyiv forces still hold swaths of the territory and where North Korean troops are reported to be concentrated.

**‘Way Too Late’ – Ukraine at War Update for Nov. 18**
The US has allowed Ukraine to use US-made weapons to strike deep into Russia, a move that follows months of pleas by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The change comes in response to Russia's deployment of North Korean ground troops and a massive new Russian missile and drone attack on Ukrainian cities. Ukraine plans to conduct its first long-range attacks in the coming days, using ATACMS rockets with a range of up to 190 miles. Zelensky said, 'But strikes are not made with words. Such things are not announced.' The decision could help Ukraine in negotiations with Russia and potentially affect other Western long-range weapons. However, President-elect Trump could reverse the decision when he takes office in January.

**US Allows Ukraine to Strike Russia with ATACMS Missiles**
The United States has decided to allow Ukraine to use American-made weapons, such as the ATACMS missile system, to strike Russia, according to two US officials and a source familiar with the decision. This policy shift, made in response to Russia's deployment of North Korean troops, will enable Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia. The Kremlin has not yet commented, but some Russian lawmakers have called this move a major escalation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has long requested the ability to strike further behind Russian lines, which is essential for disrupting enemy logistics and command chains. The US had initially hesitated to provide the ATACMS system, fearing it would be seen as an escalation, but eventually provided a shorter-range version with a maximum range of 165 km. A longer-range version, with a maximum range of 300 km, was provided in early 2024. With US authorization, Ukraine will now be able to strike targets inside Russia, likely around the Koursk region, where Ukrainian forces still hold territory and where North Korean troops are concentrated. Analysts have estimated that hundreds of Russian military objects are within the range of the ATACMS system.

**France and UK Give Ukraine Permission to Strike Deep Within Russia**
France and the UK have given Ukraine permission to use their long-range missiles to strike deep within Russian territory, according to the Figaro publication. 'The French and British have given Ukraine permission to strike Russian territory using their Scalp/Storm Shadow missiles,' the article states. This follows a previous decision by the US to allow Ukraine to use the ATACMS missiles for strikes within Russia. The Storm Shadow missile, developed jointly by France and the UK, has a range of 250-560 km and has been used by the Ukrainian military since 2023. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that allowing Ukraine to use Western long-range missiles would be a direct involvement of NATO in the conflict, and that it would change the 'entire nature of the conflict.' He added that Russia would take corresponding measures in response to the threats created.

**US Allows Ukraine to Use ATACMS Missiles to Strike Targets in Russia**
US President Biden has reportedly allowed Ukraine to use American ATACMS missiles to strike targets in Russia. This decision has been met with mixed reactions from experts. Some believe that this move will escalate the conflict, while others think it will not change the outcome but create significant problems. The French and British governments have also allowed Ukraine to use their Storm Shadow and SCALP missiles. The Russian government has warned that this move will change the character of the conflict and that the US and its allies will be responsible for the consequences. The director of the Center for the Study of Military and Political Conflicts, Andrey Klintsevich, stated that the Storm Shadow and SCALP missiles have a penetrating warhead that creates a serious threat to Russian objects, including nuclear storage facilities and anti-missile defense systems. He also noted that these missiles are not new to Russia, as they have already been used in Crimea. Klintsevich believes that the escalation of the conflict will reach its peak by the inauguration of the next US president in January 2025. Other experts have suggested that a possible response to this move could be to target NATO objects, such as the base in Poland's Zheshuv, which is a major logistics hub for NATO's military aid to Ukraine.

**Trump May Reconsider Biden's Decision on ATACMS Strikes in Russia**
According to a representative of Donald Trump's transition team, the former US president may reconsider Joe Biden's decision to allow the Ukrainian military to launch ATACMS tactical ballistic missiles deep into Russian territory. This decision, which Biden made two months before Trump's inauguration, was reportedly influenced by the presence of North Korean troops in the Kursk region. Biden authorized the use of ATACMS for strikes deep into Russian territory, as reported by unnamed sources in The New York Times. Trump is set to take office on January 20, 2025, and may reevaluate this decision upon his return to the White House.

'Almost everything will be reviewed,' the source said. Trump is set to replace Biden as president on January 20, 2025. Biden initially allowed Ukraine to use ATACMS on November 17, and Western media reported that Ukraine may launch an attack in the coming days. The White House declined to comment officially.

**France and UK Allow Ukraine to Strike Deep into Russia with Long-Range Missiles**
France and the UK have given their approval for Ukraine to use long-range missiles to attack deep into Russia, following the US. According to Le Figaro, 'France and the UK have allowed Ukraine to deeply strike Russian territory with their SCALP/Storm Shadow missiles.' The US, under President Joe Biden, had previously allowed Ukraine to use ATACMS missiles with a range of 300 kilometers on Russian territory, supposedly to protect their forces in the Kursk region. However, this decision has sparked concerns that it may provoke a response from Russia. As Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski noted, 'Biden responded to North Korea's entry into the war and Russia's massive missile strike with language that Vladimir Putin understands.' The White House is worried that this decision may destabilize the global market if a missile hits a key oil facility in the Kursk region. The decision was made after Biden's approval, which was previously withheld, due to the election of Donald Trump, who is suspected of wanting to reduce military aid to Ukraine. Trump's inauguration is scheduled for January 2025.

**With Biden's ATACMS Approval, Will Moscow Be Within Ukraine's New Missile Range?**
President Joe Biden's administration has reportedly approved Ukraine's use of US-made ATACMS missiles to strike deep into Russia. According to Reuters, citing sources, Ukraine plans to conduct its first long-range attacks soon. While the White House has not confirmed the ban lift, several reports suggest that Ukraine will now have access to the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS. This development comes as Ukraine prepares to expand its missile range, potentially bringing Moscow within its reach.

**France and UK Allow Ukraine to Strike Deep Within Russia**
France and the UK have allowed for the use of long-range missiles to strike deep within Russian territory. According to Le Figaro, citing TASS, Ukraine 'can use SCALP/Storm Shadow missiles for these purposes.' This comes after The New York Times reported that US President Joe Biden has authorized the use of ATACMS tactical ballistic missiles to strike Russian territory. The US Department of Defense declined to comment on the matter. 'France and the UK have given the green light for Ukraine to use long-range missiles to strike deep within Russia,' said no one directly in the article, however the implication is clear. The use of SCALP/Storm Shadow missiles by Ukraine is seen as a significant escalation in the conflict.

**Biden Authorizes Ukraine to Use Long-Range Missiles Against Russia**
US President Joe Biden has announced that he is authorizing the use of long-range missiles by Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory. This decision, made just before Biden's departure from the White House, has been met with a warning from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has threatened reprisals. The missiles, called ATACMS, can reach targets up to 300 kilometers away and are expected to be used initially in the Koursk region, where North Korean soldiers have been deployed in support of Russian troops. According to officials speaking to the New York Times, this decision does not significantly change the course of the war, but it does send a message to North Korea that its army is vulnerable. 'We have given the green light to the use of long-range missiles,' said a source close to the administration. 'These missiles will be used to hit sites that are important to the Russian army, such as logistics sites and airfields.' Donald Trump, who is set to return to the White House in January, has been critical of the billions of dollars in aid sent to Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion in 2022. 'Either the incoming administration will approve and extend the authorization given by the Biden administration, in order to show Putin that they will not let Ukraine negotiate peace in a position of weakness, or Trump will revoke this authorization and it will be very difficult to deny an alignment with Putin's and Russia's best interests,' said Corentin Sellin, a specialist on the US.

**Putin Warns of NATO Involvement if Ukraine Strikes Deep into Russia**
According to 'Kommercsant', Russian President Vladimir Putin stated in September that allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory with long-range artillery would be equivalent to direct NATO involvement in the conflict. The US government has declined to comment on the decision to allow Ukraine to use ATACMS long-range missiles to strike deep into Russian territory. The ATACMS missiles, produced in the US, are likely to be used initially against Russian and North Korean forces to protect Ukrainian military units in the Kursk region of western Russia. US President Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use ATACMS missiles for the first time, a move that was made just two months before the change of power in Washington and is considered a 'significant shift in US policy'. The decision has sparked divided opinions among Biden's advisors.

**Ukraine May Use ATACMS Missiles to Strike Deep into Russia**
According to sources, Ukraine may use ATACMS missiles, with a range of up to 190 miles (306 km), to strike deep into Russia after receiving permission from the US. The first strikes could occur in the coming days, sources told Reuters. The US decision, which was also reported by The New York Times, is a response to the presence of North Korean soldiers in the Kursk region, which is partially under Ukrainian control. Russia and North Korea signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement in 2024, which includes a provision that requires both countries to provide military assistance to each other in case of an attack. However, Russia claims that the agreement does not violate international law. President Vladimir Putin warned in August that if Ukraine is allowed to use long-range missiles on Russian territory, it would be equivalent to NATO and European countries declaring war on Russia. 'This would mean that countries of NATO, the US, and European countries are at war with Russia,' Putin said. 'We will take the necessary decisions.' The Ukrainian military has used ATACMS missiles in other areas of the conflict, with the Defense Ministry reporting that eight such missiles were shot down in a week in November, and several more were shot down over Crimea in May.

Russia claims that this agreement does not violate international law. Ukrainian forces have used ATACMS rockets in other areas of the conflict, with the Ministry of Defense reporting that eight such rockets were shot down between November 2 and 8. President Vladimir Putin stated in August that if Ukraine is allowed to use long-range rockets on Russian territory, it would be equivalent to NATO and European countries declaring war on Russia, and would prompt corresponding measures.

**US Allows Ukraine to Use ATACMS Missiles to Strike Deeper into Russia**
The US has allowed Ukraine to use ATACMS missiles to strike deeper into Russia. According to the publication, the weapon will likely be used first against Russian and North Korean forces to protect Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region in western Russia. The decision by Biden is a significant change in US policy, which has divided his advisors. As reported by official sources, the permission for Ukraine to use the long-range missiles, known as Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), is a response to Russia's unexpected decision to deploy North Korean troops. 'This is a response to Russia's decision to bring in North Korean troops,' said an official. 'We are giving Ukraine the tools it needs to defend itself.'
