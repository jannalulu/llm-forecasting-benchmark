**Box Office: Hollywood Cooking Up Record-Breaking Thanksgiving Feast**
This Thanksgiving, Hollywood is cooking up a record-breaking feast with the release of three highly anticipated films: Gladiator II, Wicked, and Moana 2. According to Comscore, the three films are expected to fuel the biggest Thanksgiving weekend in history in terms of overall revenue, with Moana 2 tracking to open to a massive $125 million to $150 million for the five days. Wicked is expected to open with $85 million, while Gladiator II is tracking to debut to $65 million or more. The films are expected to narrow the year-over-year gap in domestic box office earnings, which has been affected by the lengthy 2023 labor strikes and ongoing COVID-related delays. As one top studio executive notes, 'When there are great choices, the business hums.'

**10 Movies Releasing In 2025 That Are Major Box Office Risks**
The 2025 movie release schedule is full of box office risks, with several high-budget films that may struggle to turn a profit. Some of the most notable risks include the $400 million Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning, the $269.4 million Snow White remake, and the $150 million Mickey 17. Other films, such as Wicked Part Two and Sinners, may also face challenges at the box office. However, some films, like Jurassic World Rebirth and Saw XI, are expected to be hits. The success of these films will depend on various factors, including their marketing, production quality, and audience reception. 'It's a tough time for the box office,' said a Hollywood insider. 'Even the biggest franchises are struggling to make a profit.'

**‘Red One’ tops North America box office but could end up in the red**
Amazon and MGM's new winter holiday film 'Red One' topped the North American box office with estimated ticket sales of US$34.1 million, but faces a challenging path to profitability due to its US$250 million budget. Analyst David A. Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research stated, 'This is a soft opening for a movie that was designed from the beginning to launch a new Christmas action comedy series.' The film, starring Dwayne Johnson, was a crowd-pleaser but its budget, including a reported US$50 million cost overrun, means its opening was 'not a disaster but... not enough' to ensure profitability. Meanwhile, Venom: the Last Dance slipped to second place, earning US$7.4 million in its fourth weekend out, and has now earned US$127.6 million domestically and US$308 million internationally.

**Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Non-Marvel Superhero Movie Gets Free Streaming Home Before Kraven**
Before the release of Kraven the Hunter, fans can watch Aaron Taylor-Johnson's superhero film Kick-Ass for free on Tubi starting December 1. The movie, directed by Matthew Vaughn, follows the story of Dave Lizewski (Taylor-Johnson), a high school student who becomes a superhero. Kick-Ass was a precursor to edgier comic book adaptations like The Boys and Invincible, and it performed well at the box office, grossing $96 million worldwide on a budget of $30 million. The franchise is being rebooted, with a new trilogy planned, and Taylor-Johnson will soon appear in Kraven the Hunter, the first film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe to receive an R rating, which hits theaters on December 13.

**Sony Pictures' 'Kraven the Hunter' Expected to Flop at the Box Office**
According to Box Office Theory, Sony Pictures is expecting another failure with their upcoming film 'Kraven the Hunter', with predicted box office earnings of $52 million in the US and a total of no more than $200 million worldwide. Considering the average theater commission of around 50% and the film's estimated budget of $110-150 million, these earnings would not be enough to cover the costs. The predictions are based on online discussions, ticket pre-orders, and general audience sentiment towards the film. While there is a possibility that the film may exceed expectations, the fact that all previous similar films from Sony Pictures have had mediocre quality and received average/low ratings from audiences suggests that the predictions may be adjusted downwards. 'Kraven the Hunter' is set to premiere worldwide on December 11.

**Venom 3's Box Office Impact: What It Could Mean for Sony's Kraven the Hunter and Future Marvel Movies?**
The box office performance of Venom: The Last Dance could indicate how well Sony's next Marvel movie, Kraven the Hunter, will fare in 2024. Despite a slow start, the film has found its footing and is performing well overseas, with $317 million worldwide. However, critics have given it a 40% Rotten Tomatoes score. Kraven the Hunter, starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson, will face stiff competition in December, including Lord of the Rings: The War of Rohirrim and Sonic the Hedgehog 3. The movie's R-rating may also be a challenge in the holiday season. While Venom 3's success gives hope for Sony's anti-hero stories, it remains to be seen if Kraven can draw fans away from other popular films.

**Venom: The Last Dance Crosses Major Box Office Milestone, But It’s Still the Lowest-Grossing Venom Movie**
Venom: The Last Dance has become the No. 1 movie at the box office for three weeks in a row, earning an additional $16.2 million over the weekend. The movie has now passed the $100 million mark domestically, with a global total of $394 million. However, this is still the lowest-grossing Venom movie, with its predecessors earning more than double that amount. According to Sony, the movie's Rotten Tomatoes score of 41% is above average for the Spider-Man Universe, but indicates a case of diminishing returns. The movie's box office performance is expected to be surpassed by Red One, a Christmas comedy starring Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans, which is projected to open with $20-40 million. Venom 3's opening weekend of $51 million was a franchise low, lower than Black Adam's opening weekend in 2022. The movie's performance is a concern for the future of the Spider-Man Universe, which will release the R-rated Kraven the Hunter in December.

**'Vaiana 2' Could Surpass 'Del Revés 2' at the Box Office**
Disney believes that 'Vaiana 2' could surpass the success of 'Del Revés 2' (Inside Out 2) at the box office. According to Deadline, Adam Aron, CEO of AMC Theatres, is convinced that the upcoming releases of 'Vaiana 2', 'Wicked', and 'Mufasa: El Rey León' will push the US box office revenue for 2024 to over $9 billion. He also stated, 'Some people who know the topic tell me that 'Vaiana 2' could even eclipse the success of 'Del revés 2'. This would mean surpassing the $653 million achieved by the sequel of 'Inside Out' in the domestic market, with $154.2 million of them in its opening weekend, making it the second-best release of the year, just behind 'Deadpool y Lobezno', which made $211.4 million in its first weekend. The predictions were already good, with forecasts of $100 million in domestic box office revenue in the first 5 days of 'Vaiana 2', surpassing the $82 million achieved by the original in 2016.

**What Venom 3's Box Office Means For Sony's Next 2024 Marvel Movie**
Venom: The Last Dance's box office performance suggests that Sony's next Marvel movie, Kraven the Hunter, has a chance to be successful. Despite a disappointing opening weekend, the film is holding up better than expected in its second weekend, earning $26.1 million and topping the weekend box office charts. The film's success is a positive sign for the Sony Spider-Man Universe, which has been a mixed bag since 2018's Venom. However, Kraven the Hunter faces tough competition during the holiday season, including The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim and Mufasa: The Lion King. The film's R rating could also affect its box office, as families are looking for family-friendly entertainment during the holidays. Nevertheless, Kraven the Hunter has a talented cast and crew, and positive word-of-mouth could help it perform well at the box office.

**There will be blood, violence, and adult language in Marvel & Sony's Kraven the Hunter according to MPA rating**
Kraven the Hunter, the next film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe, has been rated R for 'strong bloody violence, and language.' The film, which does not involve Spider-Man, follows the story of Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Kraven as he slices and dices his way through his foes. The R-rating is not new for comic book films, as Blade, released in 1998, was also rated R and became a hit. It remains to be seen if Kraven the Hunter will be able to match Blade's iconic opening scene. Kraven the Hunter is set to release in theaters on December 13, 2024.

**Venomverse’s Box Office Silver Lining: It’s Big Abroad**
Despite a disappointing North American opening of $51 million, Venom: The Last Dance performed well internationally, grossing $175 million worldwide against a budget of $120 million-plus. The film's success is part of Sony's cost-conscious strategy, which has reaped millions in profits from the Venom trilogy. However, this approach can be double-edged, as seen with the mixed results of other live-action Spider-Man spinoffs, such as Morbius and Madame Web. Comscore box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian notes that the quality of the movies, appeal of lesser-known characters, and marketing strategies are crucial to success. Venom: The Last Dance has propelled the franchise past $1.5 billion in worldwide ticket sales against a combined production cost of $330 million before marketing. The upcoming film Kraven The Hunter, with an R-rating, is expected to be a different proposition, with a higher budget of around $150 million.

**Superhero films losing grip on theatres**
Venom: The Last Dance, the latest installment in the Venom franchise, has underperformed at the box office, collecting $51 million in its opening weekend, significantly down from its predecessors. Projections had estimated $65 million, and the drop-off from the first two Venom films is concerning. Internationally, the film collected $124 million, but reviews and audience scores have been poor, with a 36% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 'B-' CinemaScore. This low weekend is likely to result in the lowest-grossing year for superhero films in a dozen years, with a projected $2.25 billion worldwide for 2024, down from $7 billion in 2018. The only upcoming superhero film is Marvel's Kraven the Hunter, due out on December 13.

The third 'Venom' film, 'Venom: The Last Dance', underperformed at the box office, collecting $51 million in its opening weekend, significantly down from the previous entries. The film's production budget was $120 million, but it could still turn a profit.

Venom: The Last Dance won the box office with $51 million domestically, but fell short of expectations.

**'Venom: The Last Dance' Expected to Earn $150 Million in Opening Weekend**
According to various US industry magazines, 'Venom: The Last Dance' is expected to earn around $150 million worldwide in its opening weekend, with $65 million of that coming from the US market. This is a significant improvement over the first two films in the series, which earned $80 million and $90 million in their opening weekends, respectively. While the film's budget is estimated to be around $120 million, it would need to earn around $300 million to be considered a commercial success. However, even if the film performs poorly, it is still expected to be profitable, which is a welcome relief in the current comic book movie landscape. In comparison, 'Joker 2: Folie À Deux' and 'Madame Web' earned only $37 million and $26 million, respectively, in their first six days. Sony has big plans for its Marvel universe, including a new film, 'Kraven The Hunter', which is set to be released on December 12, 2024. The studio also plans to build on the character of Knull, the villain introduced in 'Venom 3', to create a new Thanos-like character.

**Kraven the Hunter: A Questionable Marvel Release**
A new Marvel film, Kraven the Hunter, is set to release on December 12, 2024. The film follows the character of Kraven, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who is known for his rivalry with Spider-Man in the comics. Sony seems to be lacking optimism for the film, as they have had previous flops such as Madame Web and Morbius. The marketing for Kraven the Hunter has been slow, and the film's release date has been pushed back multiple times. Comic Book Movie notes that the TV spot for the film includes some new scenes, but many of the sequences are taken from existing trailers and teasers. It remains to be seen how the film will perform, but it seems like a long shot given the studio's recent failures.
