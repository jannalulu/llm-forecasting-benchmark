**Some California Races Are Still Too Close to Call**
Several key congressional races in California remain too close to call, including the District 47 race between Democrat David Min and Republican Scott Baugh. Min holds 50.5% of the vote, while Baugh has 49.5%. Min's campaign focused on access to abortions, violence involving guns, climate action, and environmental justice, while Baugh has promised to combat inflation, fight the fentanyl crisis, and lower gas taxes. Other close races include those in Districts 22, 21, 22, and 48, where candidates such as Ken Calvert, David Valadao, Robert Garcia, and Michelle Steel are vying for seats. The candidates have highlighted various issues, including supporting farmers and the military, preserving funding for Social Security and Medicare, and ensuring abortion access.

**2024 was yet another 'change' election: From the Politics Desk**
The 2024 election marked the sixth consecutive 'change' election in the US, with either the White House or at least one chamber of Congress switching party control. According to NBC News polling, a supermajority of voters have been dissatisfied with the nation's direction, with 73% of voters in the 2024 election saying they were angry or dissatisfied with the way things were going in the country. Donald Trump won those voters, who saw him as the change agent in the race. The Senate Republican leadership elections are now remerging as a MAGA proxy fight, with Sen. Rick Scott seeking to claim the mantle of the pro-Trump wing. Scott has promised to push 'the Trump agenda' if elected, but it's far from clear that he will succeed, given the Senate's insular nature and the anonymous nature of the vote. Trump has made one public demand: The next GOP leader should support his ability to make 'recess appointments' to temporarily install personnel without Senate confirmations.

**When will we know who wins Colorado’s 8th Congressional District seat?**
The election for Colorado's 8th Congressional District seat is still too close to call, with Republican Gabe Evans leading Democratic Congresswoman Yadira Caraveo by 0.6%. According to Philip Chen, assistant professor of political science at Denver University, 'It was a close race last time and it was a close race this time.' Chen notes that the closeness of the race highlights the importance of secure ballot counting environments and the potential impact of weather on the process. He also points out that slow elections are more common than people think, and that recounts are usually unnecessary. Chen estimates that it could be by the middle of next week, on Wednesday or Thursday, before we officially know who has won the 8th Congressional District seat. 'We trigger recounts mostly because we want to make sure that the vote count is correct,' Chen said. 'Not saying it's impossible but unlikely that it would change the results.'

**Here Are the Uncalled House Races That Will Determine Control of the Chamber**
Several key House races remain uncalled, with 20 seats in 10 states still to be decided. As of Saturday evening, Republicans lead Democrats by 213 seats to 202. If the current margins hold, Republicans could gain 11 more seats, for a total of 224, while Democrats could add 9 seats, for a total of 211. Incumbent Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa) is leading by fewer than 1,000 votes in Iowa's 1st congressional district, while Democrat Cleo Fields is currently leading in Louisiana's 6th congressional district. In California, many districts have a significant number of ballots left to be counted, with incumbent Rep. Josh Harder (D-Calif.) leading in the 9th district and incumbent Rep. David Valadao (R-Calif.) leading in the 22nd district. In Oregon's 5th district, incumbent Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Ore.) is behind her Democratic challenger Janelle Bynum by 2.5 percent. In Washington's 4th district, both incumbent Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) and Republican Jerrod Sessler advanced from the top-two primary, with Newhouse leading by 4.6 percent.

**Democrats and Republicans Battle for Control of US House of Representatives in Latinx Communities**
The control of the US House of Representatives is up for grabs in the upcoming elections, with Democrats and Republicans vying for power. The Democrats have invested millions of dollars in states they already control, but the Republicans are fighting to hold onto their strongholds in Latinx communities. The outcome of the elections will be decided by a handful of competitive districts, including several in California and New York. Democrats have been working hard to connect with Latinx voters, holding events such as 'Boletas y Belleza' (Beauty and Ballots) in California's Central Valley, where they are focusing on issues such as healthcare and immigration. 'We have strong candidates running to retake seats in districts with high Latinx populations in California and New York,' said José Alonso Muñoz, secretary of Hispanic media for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). 'We've been working hard to connect with Latinx voters, talking to them about the issues that matter to their families and talking to them about the work that Democrats have done to reduce costs, expand healthcare, and protect fundamental freedoms.' The DCCC has invested $27 million in additional ads focused on taking seats away from Republicans, including $1.5 million for Spanish-language TV ads, mostly in districts 13 and 22. In the 22nd district, Democratic candidate Rudy Salas is running against Republican incumbent David Valadao in a rematch of the 2022 election. 'There's no doubt that control of the House of Representatives hinges on the Central Valley,' said Salas. 'If we win here, we can take back the House and offer real results for working families in the Valley and across the country.' Salas has been focusing on issues such as healthcare and immigration, and has been endorsed by the Democratic Party. 'Latinos are an essential part of my campaign,' said Salas. 'This is the most Latino district in California, and it's the home of César Chávez, Dolores Huerta, and the farmworkers' movement. However, this region has never had a Latino representative in Congress.' Salas added that as a congressman, he would work to reduce the cost of healthcare and medications, fight for a path to citizenship for residents who have been working hard and following the rules, and protect Dreamers and DACA students. 'We know that if we can take back the House, we can protect Social Security, protect Medicare, protect reproductive freedom,' said Democratic candidate George Whitesides, who is running against Republican incumbent Mike Garcia in the 27th district. 'We can continue to reduce the cost of healthcare and medications for people. And we know that none of those things will be possible with the current Republican majority in Congress.' Whitesides has been focusing on issues such as healthcare and immigration, and has been endorsed by the Democratic Party. 'Latinos are a big part of our district and we've always centered the Latinx community in our campaign because we knew they were going to be a big part of the future,' said Whitesides. 'We've always centered the Latinx community in our communications. We have promoters who go door-to-door. They go out in a bilingual team to talk to people in Spanish or English, depending on who they meet in the community. We make an effort to reach people where they are.' Whitesides mentioned that his opponent Mike Garcia, who is the son of Mexican immigrants, has allied himself with Trump and supports his promise to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. Noticias Telemundo contacted Garcia's campaign for an interview but did not respond until the time of publication. 'These elections, for me, are the most important of my life, because they will determine the future that we will have as Latinos,' said Xiomara Flores, a 66-year-old social worker who volunteered for Whitesides' campaign. Flores said that she knows the parents of Whitesides' wife, Hidalgo, and that 'working with the campaign feels like being part of a family. Talking about my candidate is so easy, because I see the work he does for Latinos.' Flores, the daughter of Nicaraguan migrants, said that since the 2016 elections, when Clinton and Trump faced off for the presidency, she has felt 'hostility' and intimidation for being Latina, even from people she knew. They questioned her immigration status. She lost friends. That made her self-censor, not talk about politics, not express her public support for Democrats. But that changed this election. 'When I found out we were going to enter a campaign that was going to be so dangerous, because of what we saw on January 6, I said, 'No, I also have the right to publish, talk about the party and the candidate, especially the party that I love, the party that has represented civil rights, which are so important and that people died to obtain these civil rights,' said Flores, excited. 'It's not perfect. And I remind you that you have to unite more and we have to be part of that party, which I've seen since June, but today I'm walking with my Whitesides t-shirt and I no longer have that fear. Why? I know I have confidence, I have the right to support not only my candidate George Whitesides, but also Vice President Kamala Harris.'

**Rudy Salas: A Key Candidate for Democrats to Regain Control of the US House of Representatives**
Rudy Salas, a 47-year-old Democrat, is a key candidate for the Democratic Party to regain control of the US House of Representatives. He is running for the 22nd Congressional District in California, a predominantly Hispanic and agricultural area where Democrats have gained a registration advantage over Republicans in recent years. Salas, who hopes to make history as the first Hispanic elected to Congress from this district, said he wants to give his community a leader who will fight for their real needs. 'The residents of this area have many concerns that can be addressed from Congress, and I will work from there to improve their situation,' he said. Salas is running against Republican Congressman David Valadao, who won the election in 2022 by just 4,000 votes. The district has a 60% Latino eligible voter population, and Salas has been working to educate voters on why this election is important to them and their families. He has been door-to-door, making over 1 million calls, and holding dozens of community forums. Salas' campaign has focused on the major concerns of the district's residents, including healthcare, education, access to clean water, the economy, affordable housing, and immigration. He supports a pathway to citizenship for long-term undocumented immigrants and opposes mass deportations and the expansion of migrant detention centers. Salas has also criticized Valadao's votes against laws to reduce medication costs, the Affordable Care Act, and the Infrastructure Act, among others. The Democratic Party needs to flip at least four seats in the House to regain control, making Salas' campaign highly relevant.

**House Republican from California aims to defy district's blue lean - Washington Examiner**
Rep. David Valadao (R-CA) is a rare California Republican who has distanced himself from former President Donald Trump and still managed to win re-election. Valadao's district, the 22nd Congressional District, is a Republican outpost in a heavily Democratic state. His opponent, former Democratic state Assemblyman Rudy Salas, has a clear edge with registered voters, with 42% of the district's voters registered as Democrats. However, voters in this district have a history of splitting their tickets, and Valadao has held steady in his opposition to Trump. Salas has criticized Valadao for his vote against capping insulin at $15 and his approach to healthcare, but Valadao's campaign is confident that voters will look back on his record and continue to support him. 'I have to focus on winning my race, and that's my top priority,' Valadao said at a recent debate with Salas. 'And I've purposely gone out of my way to make sure I'm not getting involved in anything presidential.'

**The stakes for the House are enormous as a purple district in California votes**
The 22nd congressional district in California is a key battleground in the upcoming House elections. Republican incumbent David Valadao and Democratic challenger Rudy Salas are facing off in a rematch of their 2022 contest. Despite the district's purple lean, voter turnout has been low, with only 3rd fewest ballots cast nationwide in 2022. Democratic canvassers are hoping to change this by getting more people to vote, but Valadao's moderate stance on issues like immigration may make it difficult for Democrats to win. As one voter, Sharon Nichol, said, 'I am a Republican, but when it comes to serving Kern County specifically, I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican. I want somebody who's going to do work in my city and get some results.'

**2024 US Elections: A Historic Shift in the US Congress?**
The 2024 US elections could lead to a historic shift in the US Congress, with the House of Representatives potentially falling under Democratic control, while the Senate would be controlled by Republicans. This scenario has never been seen in the 230-year history of the US Congress. The electoral maps for the House of Representatives and the Senate are very different, which explains this possible inversion. Democrats need only four more seats to regain the majority in the House. Democrats have a higher chance of winning in the House. In New York, four Republican-held seats in 2022 could flip to Democrats. A recent Newsday/Siena College poll shows that Democratic candidate Laura Gillen is leading Republican candidate Anthony D'Esposito in the 4th district by 12 points. Other polls indicate that Democrats could also win in the 17th, 19th, and 22nd districts, where the races are very close. The fight for Senate control is much more difficult for Democrats. Republicans could win two key seats, including in West Virginia, where Joe Manchin is retiring, and in Montana, where Jon Tester is facing a tough battle. Other opportunities for Republicans are in Ohio, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The trend of voting in line with presidential elections is becoming more common. In 2020, only 4% of House districts voted differently for the presidential election and their representative in the House. This phenomenon makes predictions clearer: districts won by Biden are now top targets for Democrats. In California, five Republican-held seats could also be won by Democrats, strengthening the possibility of a Democratic majority in the House. A historic result is possible?

**Map shows House seats most likely to flip in congressional elections**
The battle for control of the House of Representatives is heating up, with Democrats and Republicans neck and neck two weeks before the November 5 election. According to the Cook Political Report, there are 27 toss-up races, with 12 held by Democrats and 15 by Republicans. FiveThirtyEight's House forecast shows the race as a dead heat, with Democrats and Republicans winning their simulation 50 times each. Democrats could take back a slight majority by sweeping the competitive races in New York and California, two solidly Democratic states where Republicans outperformed expectations in 2022. In New York, there are five competitive races, including the 22nd Congressional District, where Republican Brandon Williams is facing a challenge from Democrat state Senator John Mannion. A poll conducted by GQR showed Mannion with a 7-point lead, 50 percent to 43 percent. In California, there are five toss-up seats currently held by Republicans and two seats classified as 'Lean Democrat.' Democrat Adam Gray is challenging Representative John Duarte in a Central Valley-based seat, a rematch of the race two years ago, in California's 13th District. Independent polls are showing tight races in some districts where Republicans are favored, including Virginia's 2nd District, where Republican Representative Jen Kiggans is leading Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal by one point, and New Jersey's 7th District, where Republican Representative Tom Kean is leading Democrat Sue Altman by two points.

Rudy Salas, a former Assemblyman and Bakersfield native, is running for the 22nd Congressional District seat against incumbent David Valadao. Salas lost to Valadao by 3 percentage points in 2022, but hopes to gain momentum this time around by promising to stand for Central Valley families at the federal level. He highlighted his legislative successes, including opposition to gas tax increases and securing funding for a Valley Fever Institute in Kern County. Salas also emphasized his commitment to addressing rising medical costs, improving immigration systems, and cracking down on criminal consequences. He stated, 'I think we need to bring more accountability into those dollars, into those resources, to make sure that we're actually helping people.'

**California's Voters May Determine the Balance of Power in Congress**
California's voters may determine the balance of power in Congress in November, with 52 competitive House of Representatives seats up for grabs. The Republicans currently control the House with a slim majority of eight seats, thanks in part to the 2022 elections, where some California seats changed from blue to red. In the Central Valley, Orange County, and East Los Angeles, the most competitive districts are located. Among the 10 most competitive districts, the Republicans hold seven seats. In the 13th district, Representative John Duarte (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Adam Gray in a rematch of the 2022 election. Duarte won the district for the first time since 1974, with a margin of less than 600 votes. In the 22nd district, Representative David Valadao (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Rudy Salas in the San Joaquin Valley, a region known for its agricultural production. In the 27th district, Representative Mike García (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat George Whitesides, a former NASA administrator. In the 45th district, Representative Michelle Steel (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Derek Tran, a veteran, entrepreneur, and consumer rights lawyer. In the 47th district, the news is still developing. The candidates are vying for the support of voters in the north of Los Angeles County, including the cities of Lancaster, Palmdale, and Santa Clarita, as well as parts of Los Angeles. Steel, a Korean immigrant, has been a strong advocate for reducing taxes and spending, while Tran has emphasized the need to protect the rights of consumers and workers. 'I am in touch with the problems of the district and have a lot of credibility with a lot of people,' Duarte said. 'The message is clear: bring water to farms, drill American oil, and control the cost of living.' 'I am running for Congress because politicians have created more problems than they have solved,' Whitesides said. 'I will use my business experience to solve problems, not play politics.' 'My parents were refugees who worked hard and sacrificed so that I could achieve the American dream,' Tran said. 'I enlisted in the Army to repay the country for what it has given me, and I am running for Congress to put people ahead of politics, protect our democracy, and ensure that everyone, regardless of where they come from, has the opportunity to succeed without fear of having their freedoms taken away.'

**Our View: Vote for Valadao for 22nd Congress; Bains for 35th Assembly**
In the 22nd Congressional District, voters have a choice between two good candidates: incumbent Republican Rep. David Valadao and former Democratic Assemblyman Rudy Salas. Both men share qualities of independence and a commitment to moderate policies. Valadao has been a consistent winner in the district, despite its large Democratic voter registration and Latino population. He has been open to reasonable immigration reform and has been a vocal critic of former President Trump's agenda. Salas has also bucked his party, voting against raising the state gas tax in 2017. The two men have differing views on climate change policies and the Affordable Care Act. Valadao has been criticized for voting to support Trump's efforts to terminate the Affordable Care Act, while Salas has slammed Valadao for backing climate change policies that have raised costs on California consumers. Despite their differences, both men have demonstrated their willingness to reach across the aisle to address needs. The Californian recommends reelecting Valadao to another two-year congressional term. In the 35th Assembly District, incumbent Democrat Assemblywoman Dr. Jasmeet Bains should be reelected to another two-year term. Bains has focused her reelection campaign on improving affordability in her district, including constituents' ability to put food on the table, pay for their children's education and buy gasoline. She has bucked her party leaders and has been a productive, independent representative for Kern County. The Californian recommends reelecting Bains.

**In an ultra-competitive California House race, Democrats try to claim their place**
In California's 22nd Congressional district, Democratic challenger Rudy Salas is running against Republican incumbent David Valadao for a second time. Despite the district's history of voting Democratic, Valadao has represented the region in Congress for most of the past decade. Democratic canvassers like Noe Garcia are hoping to change this by getting more people to vote, citing the influence of Kamala Harris on voter engagement. However, Valadao's moderate stance on issues like abortion and immigration reform may make it difficult for Democrats to win. Salas has also broken from his party in meaningful ways, such as opposing a gas tax in 2017. Despite differences with their parties, both candidates have managed to build healthy funding for their campaigns. To flip the district, Democrats need a stronger message, voters say.

**US House control teeters on the unlikely battleground of heavily Democratic California**
California's 52 House seats are crucial battlegrounds in the US House control, with 10 seats considered in play. Democrats dominate the state, but Republicans retain pockets of strength. The most competitive contests are concentrated in Republican-held districts that were carried by Joe Biden in 2020. Democrats are warning about former President Donald Trump's possible return to Washington, threats to abortion rights, and gun violence, while Republicans fault Democrats on crime, a porous southern border, high taxes, and inflation. Rep. Pete Aguilar has predicted the decisive fight for the chamber 'will run through California.' Several key races are highlighted, including Rep. Mike Garcia's bid for re-election in a heavily Democratic district, Rep. Ken Calvert's fight to hold off Democrat Will Rollins, and the Central Valley's 22nd District, where GOP Rep. David Valadao is seeking to keep his seat.

**Turnout has been key to Central Valley tossup House races. What experts expect in 2024**
The 2024 congressional races in California's Central Valley could be decided by turnout, particularly among young and Latino voters. Experts expect higher turnout due to the competitiveness and presidential election. However, changing demographics and party affiliations may affect the outcome. College-educated voters are moving to Democrats, while non-college-educated voters are shifting to Republicans. Latinos are also showing a rightward shift. The 13th and 22nd Congressional Districts have high populations of non-college-educated voters and a growing no-party-preference bloc. To win, campaigns need to actively reach out to key issues and earn the votes of Latino voters, who lack trust in either party. 'It's really about the composition of the population in these districts that's driving the change,' said Eric McGhee, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. 'Their votes need to be earned,' added Pablo Rodriguez, founding Executive Director of Communities for a New California Education Fund.

**David Valadao vs. Rudy Salas in California Congress tossup: Candidates answer key questions**
The 2024 election for California's 22nd Congressional District is a tossup between Rep. David Valadao (R-Hanford) and former Assemblyman Rudy Salas (D-Bakersfield). According to nonpartisan analysts, the district, which has more registered Democrats than Republicans, could go either way in November. Valadao has been in the House since 2013, while Salas has been in the California State Assembly for a decade. The district is one of several that Democrats are hoping to flip to gain the House majority in 2025. Both candidates were asked to fill out a survey, and their responses were checked and slightly edited for spelling and grammar. According to Valadao, he will urge pro-growth policies to ease the tax burden on middle-class families, increase domestic energy production, and make it easier to build new housing. Salas, on the other hand, will fight to deliver an expanded child tax credit, champion a first-time home buyer tax credit, and work to make lifesaving medicines more affordable. Both candidates also discussed immigration and border policy, with Valadao supporting the construction of physical barriers and reforming the asylum process, and Salas advocating for a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers and increasing the number of immigration judges.

**Democrats’ Path for Control of House Runs Through Districts Like California’s 22nd in the Central Valley**
The 22nd Congressional District in California is a key battleground in the fight for control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Democratic former state lawmaker Rudy Salas is challenging Republican U.S. Representative David Valadao, who has held the seat since 2013. Salas has criticized President Joe Biden for not doing enough to lower monthly costs for voters, while Valadao has broken with former President Trump on issues such as tariffs and mass deportations. The district is the most racially diverse competitive House district in the country, and voters are sympathetic to the immigrant situation. 'People are a lot more sympathetic to the immigrant situation because so many of us here are immigrants,' said Valadao. The presidential campaigns have largely ignored California, resulting in less 'ad clutter' and more opportunities for congressional campaigns to break through. However, Salas' campaign is being outspent by Republicans, and labor activist Dolores Huerta is campaigning and organizing canvassers for Salas to ensure that Democrats do not underestimate the importance of the California races.

**California House candidates spar on prices. What it means for tossup election**
The economy is the top issue for voters in California's 22nd Congressional District, with costs and income being major concerns. Rep. David Valadao and former Assemblyman Rudy Salas debated on how to address these issues, with Valadao blaming state regulations for higher costs and Salas arguing that Congress can do more to alleviate high prices. Experts say that Congress and state legislatures can impact costs through taxation changes, government spending, and policies such as increasing the housing supply. However, they also note that the legislative bodies have limited power to control prices, which are ultimately determined by market forces and external factors. Salas was criticized for voting against raising the gas tax in 2017, but his spokesperson argued that he voted on legislation to affirm or introduce taxes and fees, and that GOP Assemblymembers also supported some of these bills. Valadao was also criticized for voting against capping insulin prices at $35 a month in 2022, but he argued that it was an arbitrary cap that would lead to pharmacies and companies buying prescription drugs from other countries where the medicine is cheaper and potentially worse.

**David Valadao, Rudy Salas clash on costs in debate for tossup California House race**
In a debate for the hotly contested 2024 California House race, Rep. David Valadao and former Assemblyman Rudy Salas clashed over their records on reducing costs in the San Joaquin Valley. Valadao tied Salas to the Democratic supermajority in the state legislature, while Salas countered by bringing up legislation Valadao voted against in Congress. The debate also touched on issues such as high-speed rail, immigration, homelessness, water, and abortion. When asked about their views on Israel and Gaza, Valadao said it's not his place to set a red line, while Salas said Israel needs to defend itself and be given the tools to do so. Neither candidate mentioned the names 'Donald Trump' or 'Kamala Harris' during the debate. The November rematch between Valadao and Salas in California's 22nd Congressional District is a tossup, with Democrats needing to flip just four seats to take a majority in the House of Representatives in 2025.

**Breaking down the CD-22 race and its candidates ahead of high-stakes Wednesday debate**
The upcoming debate between Republican incumbent David Valadao and Democrat Rudy Salas for California's 22nd Congressional District is a high-stakes event. The district is considered a 'purple district', where either party can win. Despite being a largely Democrat and majority Latino district, Valadao has been re-elected multiple times since 2013. Experts say voter turnout will be crucial in determining the outcome of the election. 'It's a truly purple district,' said Democratic political analyst Neel Sannappa. 'How much can really change just based off this one district, that could be the difference between who has the majority in the House.' The candidates have different priorities, with Valadao focusing on water, crime, homelessness, and drugs, and Salas focusing on cost, healthcare, and choice. 'The community has been fantastic. People have been great. We just need them to turn out in November,' said Salas. The election is considered one of the most expensive races nationwide, with millions being spent by the campaigns and outside groups to sway voters.

**New poll shows Valadao-Salas race will, once again, be a difficult-to-predict toss-up**
A new Emerson College/Nexstar poll shows that the race for California's 22nd Congressional District between Republican incumbent David Valadao and Democrat Rudy Salas will be a difficult-to-predict toss-up. The poll of 350 'very likely' voters shows that 45% would vote for Valadao, 45.4% for Salas, and 10% are undecided. Despite the district leaning Democratic and Latino, a Republican has repeatedly held office, and Valadao is behind Salas by only 0.4 percentage points. The poll also reveals that male voters lean toward Valadao, while women lean toward Salas, and that immigration and the economy are top issues for CA-22 voters. 'This is not the rest of America ... All politics is local,' said Frontier High School history teacher James Maddox. 'Those problems with [Democratic] turnout are the only reasons it's really competitive at all,' Maddox added. 'Anytime that Trump's on the ballot, you get a pretty big turnout,' Maddox stated, noting that Valadao has won every time Donald Trump was simultaneously on the ballot.

**Central Valley Democrats slightly lead Republican incumbents in new tossup House race polls**
In a recent poll, Democratic challengers are narrowly leading Republican incumbents in two highly competitive San Joaquin Valley congressional races. The polls, conducted in California's 13th and 22nd Congressional Districts, show that turnout will be key to who wins in November. In the 22nd district, former Assemblyman Rudy Salas, D-Bakersfield, led Rep. David Valadao, R-Hanford, by 4.2 percentage points. In the 13th district, former Assemblyman Adam Gray, D-Merced, led freshman Rep. John Duarte, R-Modesto, by 2 percentage points. The polls also showed that new voters in these districts tend to favor the Democratic challengers, while undecided voters slightly favor the GOP incumbents. These districts are crucial to deciding who wins control of the House, and Democrats would need to flip four seats nationwide to gain a majority.
