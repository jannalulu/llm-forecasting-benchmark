Loveland Ski Area opened today. Wolf Creek has the best base depths at nearly 3 feet, with 95% of its terrain open.

**Will multiple systems allow B.C. ski resorts to open early?**
An active weather pattern is expected to bring favorable conditions to British Columbia's ski resorts, potentially allowing them to open early. Multiple systems are forecasted to sweep through the region, bringing abundant moisture and snow to the alpine areas. This year's conditions could be similar to those in 2022, when resorts like SilverStar opened earlier than expected. Whistler Mountain Resort has already received 38 cm of snow in the past 7 days, with similar totals at Revelstoke. The tentative opening dates for Whistler, Big White, and Revelstoke are Nov. 22, Nov. 28, and Nov. 30, respectively, while Kicking Horse is scheduled to open on Dec. 6. As one observer noted, 'This year could echo the conditions we saw back in 2022 as several systems are on track to bring abundant moisture to the region.'

**Ski Resorts in Bavaria Prepare for the Upcoming Season**
The ski season is approaching in and around Munich, with many ski resorts preparing for the upcoming season. The Zugspitze, Germany's highest mountain, plans to open on November 29, 2024, while Brauneck and other resorts are set to open on November 30, 2024. However, these dates are weather-dependent and may be postponed if conditions are unfavorable. The 'Ski Juwel Alpbachtal WildschÃ¶nau' will open on December 6, with the 'Garmisch-Classic' following in mid-to-late December, depending on the weather and snow conditions. Many ski resorts are investing in artificial snowmaking to ensure a successful season, with Brauneck's Antonia Asenstorfer saying, 'We are well-prepared, thanks to our powerful technical snowmaking equipment.' The Alpbachtal WildschÃ¶nau has invested 1.5 million euros in new snowmaking equipment, which has increased efficiency by 20% and reduced energy consumption. However, some resorts, like the Zugspitze, rely solely on natural snow, while others, like the 'Garmisch-Classic', are limited by the volume of their snow storage lakes.

**Snowmass Ski Resort's Lynn Britt Cabin to reopen**
Snowmass Ski Resort's Lynn Britt Cabin, also known as 'The Cabin,' is set to reopen in December after a summer-long renovation. The renovation increased the deck capacity from 115 to 260 guests, supporting 200 outdoors and 60 indoors. According to Aspen Snowmass, Snowmass lacks a total of 460 to 650 seats to meet the increased on-mountain dining demand. The Cabin's increased capacity will better disperse the high volume of dining guests across the mountain, as stated in the Snowmass 2022 master Development Plan. The renovated Cabin will offer creative comfort food and European-inspired dishes, and will feature live entertainment, aprÃ©s parties, and snowcat dinners. 'The project has been approved as construction has been happening all summer and it is set to open in December,' said SkiCo Director of Communications Hannah Dixon. 'The planned changes to The Lynn Britt Cabin and the Spider Sabich Picnic/Race Arena areas will increase utilization of those areas, taking pressure off of other restaurants,' SkiCo wrote in the plan.

**Ski season has officially started: First US ski resort is now open**
The 2024-2025 ski season has officially started with the opening of Ski Ward in Massachusetts on October 19, but it's not the first resort to offer a full mountain experience.

Breckenridge, Brian Head, and Copper Mountain have announced an opening date of November 8, while Vail, Mammoth, Winter Park, and others plan to open by mid-November.

**Austrian Ski Resort Opens in September Due to Unprecedented Snowfall**
The Hochkeil ski resort in the Austrian Alps has opened its slopes on September 15, 2024, a month earlier than usual, due to heavy snowfall caused by the storm Boris. According to the Kronen Zeitung, the decision to open was made spontaneously after seeing the large amount of natural snow on the slopes. The first 300 skiers were able to enjoy the slopes for over 4 hours from an altitude of 1500 meters. The resort will continue to adapt its opening to the changing snow conditions and visitor numbers. In contrast, French ski resorts are expected to open in December, with the first ones opening on December 1, 2024.
