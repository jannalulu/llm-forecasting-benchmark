**A brutally cold air mass is coming. How chilly will it get in your region?**
A cold air mass from the Laptev Sea north of Russia is moving towards the eastern United States, bringing temperatures in the single digits or lower to more than two dozen states. The polar plunge is expected to last into mid-December, affecting areas from Minot, North Dakota to Miami, Florida. Temperatures in the teens could reach as far south as Alabama and Georgia, while northern Florida could reach the twenties. No state is forecast to be spared from sub-freezing temperatures. The cold air will be fueled by the record warm waters of the Great Lakes, leading to heavy lake effect snow in some areas. Winter Storm Watches have been issued for areas downwind of Lake Ontario and Erie. The cold spell is not a sign of a reversal in the long-term warming trend, but rather an unusual event in a warming world.

**Warmer, drier winter forecast for South Florida with La Niña expected to emerge by year's end**
Scientists predict a 57% chance of La Niña emerging by the end of 2024, which would bring a warmer and drier winter to South Florida. According to Robert Molleda, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, 'Forecast models are all pointing to warmer than normal temperatures extending to April.' However, La Niña has been tardy in developing, and it may not have a significant impact this winter. Emily Becker, associate director of the University of Miami's Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies, said that only two La Niña events in the 75-year historical record have formed in the October to December time frame. A weak La Niña means other weather patterns can usurp its dominance, leading to raucous thunderstorms despite lower chances for severe weather.

**South Florida's first cool snap of winter season will last several days, with overnight lows in 50s**
South Florida is experiencing its first significant cooldown since last winter, with temperatures expected to dip into the 50s on Thursday night. A cold front that pushed through the region on Wednesday night is bringing dry and cool air that will last for several days. Highs will hover around the low-70s and low- to- mid-50s across Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties from Friday to the weekend. National Weather Service Miami meteorologist Ana Torres-Vazquez said temperatures will start 'inching back up' early next week but will still stay relatively cool. 'It's going to be a gradual warmup, but it's going to remain more like the average temperatures that we see during this time of year,' Torres-Vazquez said. Highs from Monday to Wednesday will range from the upper-70s to mid-80s with overnight low temperatures in the mid-60s. 'It's a good break from all the warmth that we had over the summer,' she said. With hurricane season winding down and South Florida's dry season now in full swing until May, conditions are likely to be colder and drier over the next few months.

**Cold Front Brings Unseasonable Cold to Miami**
A cold front is approaching southern Florida, bringing with it the lowest temperatures of the season. The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued a warning for a cold front that is expected to bring rain, strong winds, and a significant drop in temperature, with lows potentially reaching the mid-50s (around 10°C) over the weekend. According to the NWS, 'Before the cooler temperatures we've been expecting, a cold front will pass today and bring scattered rain and isolated thunderstorms. Thursday and later, the weather will be dry and temperatures will drop to between 45 and 50 degrees on Friday and Saturday.' The NWS predicts that if this forecast comes to pass, residents of Miami and southern Florida will experience the coldest morning of the year since February, the peak of winter in the US. 'The coolest weather the southern Florida region has experienced since last winter will arrive by the end of this week and during the weekend. The greatest chances of temperatures falling below 50 degrees will occur in the interior of southern Florida on Friday morning,' insists the NWS forecast for the next few days.

A cold front has brought cooler temperatures to Florida, with lows expected to drop to 40 in Tallahassee. While it may look like snow, the white substance is actually Florida pusley, a type of weed that blooms all year. However, the largest 'blankets' of Florida snow occur from September to January. According to the Climate Center, there have been over 80 months with at least a trace of snow reported in the state since 1886. In fact, snow has fallen in Homestead and Miami Beach, with the largest snowstorm in history occurring in 1989. As one resident noted, 'It may look like snow, there are some things we just can't do with Florida pusley, including...'

**La Niña expected to deliver warmer, drier South Florida winter**
A weak and short-lived La Niña is expected to emerge in December, leading to a warmer and drier winter in South Florida. According to Robert Molleda, chief meteorologist for the National Weather Service's Miami office, 'So warmer and drier from now all the way through April. In fact, the models are indicating that it's possible that the February to April period could tilt a little drier.' La Niñas typically push the jet stream further north, resulting in less stormy weather. The region is in good shape for water supply, but water managers are keeping an eye on Lake Okeechobee, the primary dry season source for freshwater. The Army Corps will allow the lake to recede to help it recover from high wet season levels, said Maj. Cory Bell, district deputy commander for the Corps' Jacksonville District. 'As we move forward in the dry season, we're looking at lake recovery operations, and we will communicate that with our stakeholders,' he said. With a rainy season delivering about 120% of normal rainfall, water restrictions look unlikely, according to South Florida Water Management District officials.

**Winter 2024: Countries to be Covered by Snow and Reach Freezing Temperatures**
The National Center for Atmospheric Prediction (CPC) expects a 60% chance of a phenomenon called 'nina' to occur in the United States from December 2024 to February 2025, which can cause significant temperature fluctuations and precipitation in the upper Mississippi River Valley. The CPC also predicts that the phenomenon of 'nina' will continue until March 2025, making it more likely for the world to experience colder temperatures than usual. The CPC notes that the shift from the 'nino' phenomenon to the 'nina' phenomenon will bring changes to the global climate, with some regions experiencing more variability than others. In the United States, 17 states have been issued winter weather warnings, with parts of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, and South Dakota expected to experience cold temperatures. Heavy snowfall is expected in the Oregon Cascades, with up to 2 feet of snow, and 15-18 inches of snow in the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming and the Colorado Mountains. Temperatures are expected to drop below freezing in areas affected by freeze warnings, with temperatures reaching as low as 21°F in parts of New Mexico and 22-23°F in parts of Colorado.

**2024: A Virtual Certainty for a Record-Hot Year**
The chances of 2024 being the hottest year globally are extremely high. The 2023 year was already a record year, and the combined effect of a rapid transition from La Nina to El Nino, along with the long-term warming trend, likely contributed to the significant temperature increase. With two months left in 2024, which was influenced by the now-ended El Nino phenomenon, the current cooling trend is unlikely to prevent 2024 from becoming the new record year. To avoid breaking the 2023 record, the temperature anomalies for November and December 2024 would need to be unusually low, at -0.25°C, which is highly unlikely given the previous anomalies. In fact, the anomalies for the two months would need to decrease by 0.5°C compared to the first 10 months to not exceed the 2023 average. Therefore, it can be said that 2024 is virtually certain to be the new record year, just one year after the previous one.

**2024 will be the hottest on record and the first to exceed 1.5°C of the pre-industrial average**
According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), 2024 is set to be the hottest year on record, surpassing 2023, and the first year to exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This is based on a preliminary analysis of global temperatures in October, which showed a 1.65°C increase above pre-industrial levels. Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of C3S, stated that 'it is now virtually certain that 2024 will be the hottest year on record and the first year with more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.' The ERA5 dataset indicates that 2024 will likely exceed 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels. Climate change is already resulting in intense droughts and floods, with above-average precipitation conditions observed in several regions, including the Iberian Peninsula, France, and Norway. The Arctic sea ice recorded its fourth lowest average extent in October, and sea ice extent in Antarctica was the second lowest on record. The mean sea surface temperature (SST) for October 2024 was 20.68°C, the second highest value recorded for the month.

**Tampa and Earth Break All-Time Heat Records**
The year 2024 has been extremely hot in the Tampa Bay area and around the world. According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service of the ECMWF, it is almost certain that 2024 will be the hottest year on record globally. The Tampa airport reached a record high temperature of 91°F and a record heat index of 101°F on Wednesday, adding to the summer's record heat. This brings the total number of days in Tampa with a heat index of at least 100°F to 100, breaking the previous record of 88 set in 2023 and 2022. While 2024 may not be the hottest year on record for the Tampa Bay area, it will likely be among the top five hottest years for many neighborhoods. However, globally, 2024 will be the hottest year on record since temperature records began in the 1940s. The average global temperature for the month of October 2024 was 1.65°C above pre-industrial levels, and this is the 15th month in a row where the global average surface air temperature has exceeded 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This is a critical threshold, as the Paris Climate Agreement aims to keep global temperatures below this level to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. While the planet has exceeded this threshold, it does not necessarily mean that we have failed... yet. There is a possibility that global temperatures could drop below +1.5°C next year, as a La Niña event is forming in the Pacific. However, in the long term, exceeding this threshold seems inevitable, as we continue to emit greenhouse gases that trap heat from fossil fuel burning. Due to human activities, it is likely that the Earth has not experienced global temperatures this high in over 120,000 years. These higher temperatures bring additional energy and moisture, leading to more intense storms, larger floods, and more severe heatwaves. The only way to stop the warming and return temperatures to pre-industrial levels is to reduce our use of fossil fuels.

**Tampa and Earth shattering all-time heat records**
Tampa, Florida, has broken its all-time heat record with a daily high of 91°F and an all-time November record high heat index of 101°F. This brings the total number of days with a heat index of at least 100°F to 100, breaking the previous record of 88 set in 2023 and 2022. According to ECMWF Copernicus Climate Change Service, 2024 is virtually certain to be the hottest year on record for Earth, with a global average surface air temperature of 1.65°C above the pre-industrial level in October 2024. This marks the 15th month in a 16-month period where the global average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Jeff Berardelli, WFLA's Chief Meteorologist and Climate Specialist, notes that while the planet has technically not failed to meet the 1.5C threshold, breaching it now seems inevitable due to continued greenhouse gas emissions. Berardelli emphasizes that the only way to stop the warming and bring temperatures back down to pre-industrial levels is to slow our use of fossil fuels.

**2024 Set to Be Hottest Year Ever Recorded, C3S Data Shows**
The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) has released new data showing a new record of the ongoing climate crisis. According to Samantha Burgess, C3S deputy director, 'After 10 months, it is now almost certain that 2024 will be the hottest year ever recorded and the first to exceed the 1.5°C threshold above pre-industrial levels according to ERA5 data. This record should be a catalyst to intensify efforts in view of the next COP29.' October 2024 was the second hottest October ever recorded, with a global average temperature of 15.25°C, 0.80°C above the 1991-2020 average. This October was 1.65°C above pre-industrial levels (1850-1900) and was the 15th month in a 16-month period where the global average temperature has exceeded 1.5°C. The global average temperature for the past 12 months (November 2023 - October 2024) was 0.74°C above the 1991-2020 average and 1.62°C above the pre-industrial average of 1850-1900. The global temperature anomaly for the first 10 months of 2024 was 0.71°C above the 1991-2020 average, a record value. According to C3S scientists, it is now certain that 2024 will be the hottest year ever recorded. To avoid this, the temperature anomaly would need to drop drastically to almost zero in the next two months. The 2023 anomaly was 1.48°C above pre-industrial levels, and predictions for 2024 indicate that this value will rise above 1.5°C, likely reaching 1.55°C. In Europe, October 2024 was the fifth hottest October ever recorded, with a temperature anomaly of 1.23°C above the 1991-2020 average. The record remains the October 2022, with an anomaly of 1.92°C. The most marked anomalies were recorded in northern Canada, central and western United States, Tibet, Japan, and Australia. The only regions with temperatures below average were central Greenland and Iceland. The sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly was 0.80°C above the 1991-2020 average, the second highest value ever recorded in October. Despite the passage through La Niña conditions in the Pacific equatorial eastern and central regions, SSTs remained unusually high in many areas. The Arctic sea ice extent was the fourth lowest ever recorded for October, 19% below average. The concentration of sea ice was particularly low in all marginal areas of the Arctic Ocean, with significant anomalies in the Barents Sea, Canadian Archipelago, and north of the Svalbard Islands. The Antarctic sea ice extent was also at record lows, 8% below average, the second lowest value ever recorded for October, surpassed only by October 2023 (-11%). This confirms the persistence of strong negative anomalies that have characterized both 2023 and 2024. In the Antarctic Ocean, sea ice concentrations remained very low, especially in the Indian Ocean area. The hydrological variables showed that the Iberian Peninsula, France, northern Italy, Norway, northern Sweden, and the eastern part of the Black Sea had above-average precipitation. In contrast, many areas of eastern Europe, such as western Russia, Greece, and western Turkey, had below-average precipitation and soil moisture. Unusually wet conditions were also observed in southern China and eastern China, Taiwan, Florida, some areas of western Australia, and southern Brazil. In Florida, Hurricane Milton struck the coast less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene. On the other hand, drier-than-usual conditions were observed in most of the United States, the central Australian plains, many areas of southern Africa and Madagascar, as well as parts of Argentina and Chile, where the persistent drought in the United States is affecting a record number of people.

**2024 Set to be Hottest Year on Record, Global Temperature to Exceed 1.5°C Threshold**
According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, 2024 will be the hottest year on record, with the second warmest October globally, after 2023. For the first time in history, the Earth's average annual temperature will exceed the 1.5°C threshold above pre-industrial levels. The average global temperature for the past 12 months (November 2023-October 2024) was 0.74°C above the 1991-2020 average, and 1.62°C above the pre-industrial average of 1850-1900. Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, stated, 'This marks a new milestone in global temperature records and should serve as a catalyst to increase ambition ahead of the next Climate Change Conference, COP29.' The average sea surface temperature (SST) within the 60°S-60°N coordinates reached 20.68°C in October 2024, the second highest value on record for that month, and only 0.10°C below the October 2023 value. Precipitation and soil moisture were below average in most of Eastern Europe, particularly in western Russia, Greece, and western Turkey, but were above average in southern and eastern China, Taiwan, Florida (USA), parts of western Australia, and southern Brazil. The extent of Arctic sea ice reached its fourth lowest value for an October, 19% below average, and the extent of Antarctic sea ice remained the second lowest for that month, 8% below average, continuing a series of large negative anomalies observed throughout 2023 and 2024.

**2024 to be the warmest year on record, according to Copernicus**
According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), 2024 will be the warmest year on record, surpassing the 1.5°C threshold above pre-industrial levels. The temperature anomaly for the rest of 2024 would have to drop to almost zero for 2024 not to be the warmest year. October was the second warmest October globally, with a mean air temperature of 0.80°C above the 1991-2020 average. The global temperature for the past 12 months (November 2023 - October 2024) was 0.74°C above the 1991-2020 average and 1.62°C above the pre-industrial average of 1850-1900. Copernicus also reported above-average precipitation in the Iberian Peninsula, France, northern Italy, Norway, northern Sweden, and the eastern Black Sea. However, heavy precipitation led to severe flash floods in the Spanish province of Valencia, resulting in over 200 fatalities. Temperatures were higher than average in almost the entire continent, with the highest anomalies recorded in northern Canada and the central and western United States, the northern Tibetan Plateau, Japan, and Australia. The sea surface temperature (SST) within the coordinates 60°S-60°N reached 20.68°C in October 2024, the second-highest value on record and only 0.10°C below the October 2023 value. Temperatures were below average in the eastern and central Pacific, indicating the onset of the La Niña phenomenon. Precipitation and soil moisture were below average in most of Eastern Europe, particularly in western Russia, Greece, and western Turkey. Globally, conditions were wetter than average in southern and eastern China, Taiwan, Florida, the United States (where Hurricane Milton made landfall), parts of western Australia, and southern Brazil. Copernicus observed drier-than-average conditions in most of the United States, the central lowlands of Australia, much of southern Africa, and Madagascar, and parts of Argentina and Chile. The Arctic sea ice extent reached its fourth-lowest value for an October, 19% below the average, and the Antarctic sea ice extent was the second-lowest for the month, 8% below the average, continuing a series of large negative anomalies observed throughout 2023 and 2024.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its U.S. Winter Outlook, predicting a warm and dry trend for Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia from December 2024 through February 2025. According to the report, the region will be 'drier-than-average', with drought likely to develop or worsen across portions of the Southwest and Gulf Coast. The greatest likelihood for drier-than-average conditions is in states bordering the Gulf of Mexico, as well as in Texas and southern New Mexico. Warmer-than-average temperatures are favored from the southern tier of the U.S. to the eastern Great Lakes, eastern seaboard, New England, and northern Alaska. The average daily high temperature at Jacksonville International Airport is expected to be just below 70 degrees. NOAA's Climate Prediction Center updates the three-month outlook monthly, with the next update available on November 21.
