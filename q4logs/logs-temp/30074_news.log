**Euro Closes at $1.0550 as Dollar Gains Momentum**
The Euro (EU0009652759) closed at $1.0550 in the late New York foreign exchange market on Thursday, slightly below the level in the late European market. The European Central Bank had previously set the reference rate at $1.0533 (Wednesday: $1.0629). The dollar was worth 0.9493 (0.9408) euros. Market nervousness remains high, with the dollar gaining significant momentum after Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election on November 5. Trump's campaign promises of tax cuts and higher import tariffs could increase inflation and make the US Federal Reserve more cautious in future interest rate cuts.

**Euro Falls Below $1.05 Amid Trump's Presidential Win**
The euro has fallen below $1.05 and is at its lowest level since October 2023, depreciating 4% against the US dollar since Donald Trump's presidential election win on November 5. According to analysts at Ebury, the rise in the dollar is due to investors anticipating a rise in US tariffs, elevated geopolitical risks, and increased global uncertainty under Trump's presidency. Experts at Renta4 note that the dollar's appreciation is intensified by Trump's confirmation as president, giving him two years to implement his policies without opposition, as the 'Republican wave' has also taken control of the US House of Representatives.

**Dollar climbs to one-year peak; Powell's speech in focus By Investing.com**
The US dollar has reached a one-year high, trading at 106.807, after consumer inflation data raised doubts over the extent of Fed interest rate cuts. Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election and his likely policies of lower taxes and trade tariffs have added to the uncertainty over likely Fed rate decisions. Analysts at ING said, 'We think this week's price action has given us a taste of what's to come in FX markets in this second Trump term, with brief dollar corrections taken as an opportunity to enter structural USD longs at more attractive levels.' The dollar's rise has been driven by the uncertainty over likely Fed rate decisions and Trump's policies, which are seen as inflationary. The euro, on the other hand, has struggled due to the political uncertainty in Germany and the potential for tariffs against Europe from the new Trump administration. The single currency is also facing challenges due to the German economy's fragility, with the German Council of Economic Experts cutting its growth forecasts for Europe's biggest economy for 2024 and 2025.

**Why is the euro falling and could it hit $1? By Reuters**
The euro has fallen to one-year lows, sparking concerns it could hit the $1 mark. Donald Trump's U.S. election win has raised the prospect of a hike in tariffs that could deal a fresh blow to the euro zone economy. According to JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank, a drop to parity could happen, depending on the extent of tariffs. A weak currency typically raises the cost of imports, leading to higher prices for food, energy, and raw materials. However, most economists see inflation back at its 2% target next year after some volatility at the end of 2024. A fall in the euro makes exports cheaper, which is good news for Europe's automakers, industrials, and luxury retailers. Benjamin Melman, CIO of Edmond de Rothschild, said, 'Everyone is gloomy on Europe and we understand the gloominess but we could have some positive surprises.' The ECB is in a better position than the last time the euro weakened sharply, with inflation trending lower and a relatively small pass-through from currency moves to inflation.

**Euro Could Fall to 1.0 Against US Dollar by 2025, Capital Economics Predicts**
Capital Economics predicts that the Euro could fall to 1.0 against the US dollar by the end of 2025. Economist James Reilly believes that US President-elect Donald Trump's potential introduction of tariffs next year could reduce demand for Euro region exports to the US. Reilly also notes that tariffs could shift the US-Eurozone yield gap in favor of the dollar. Reilly expects the Fed to respond to the inflationary effects of tariffs by lowering interest rates more slowly and less than previously expected, while the ECB is likely to lower interest rates more than expected due to the economic impact of slowing exports.

**Economist Predicts Dollar to Reach 102 Rubles by End of 2025**
Economist Andrei Sirotkin predicts that the US dollar will reach 100-102 rubles by the end of 2025, while the euro will be around 110 rubles. He stated, 'If the dollar is around 92-93 rubles by the end of 2024, the euro around 100 rubles, and the yuan around 11.50-12 rubles, that would be good.' Sirotkin believes that the ruble will likely weaken by the end of the year due to high inflation factors. He also stated that the situation with the ruble's exchange rate will not improve significantly in 2025. According to Sirotkin, the Russian government has announced the budget structure for 2025, which allows for high inflation. Therefore, he does not expect any positive trends in the ruble's exchange rate by the end of the year or in 2025. He concluded, 'The best-case scenario is if the situation remains at the current level or the ruble slightly strengthens.'

**Dollar Expected to Reach 100-102 Rubles by End of 2025, Euro to Reach 110 Rubles**
According to Andrey Sirotkin, a senior lecturer at the University of Synergy's department of banking, the dollar is expected to be worth between 100-102 rubles by the end of 2025, while the euro is expected to be around 110 rubles. Sirotkin stated, 'If the dollar stabilizes at around 92-93 rubles by the end of 2024, the euro at around 100 rubles, and the yuan at 11.50-12 rubles, that would be a good sign. However, it seems unlikely that these levels will be reached, as there are many inflationary factors that will likely cause the ruble to weaken by the end of the year.' Sirotkin also noted that the situation with the ruble's exchange rate in 2025 will not improve significantly. He stated that the Russian government has announced the budget structure for 2025, which allows for high inflation, and therefore, he does not expect any positive trends in the ruble's exchange rate by the end of the year or in the following year. The best-case scenario, according to Sirotkin, is if the situation remains stable or the ruble slightly strengthens.

**Belarusian Ruble Strengthens Against Russian Ruble and Yuan, Dollar Reaches Record High**
The Belarusian ruble has strengthened against the Russian ruble and the yuan. The euro has risen by 0.34% to Br3.58. The US dollar has reached a record high of Br3.2965, but failed to break the psychological mark of Br3.30. Experts believe that the average exchange rate for 2025 will be Br3.35-3.37 per dollar, as all influencing factors are already in place. According to economists, 'if nothing extraordinary happens, the status quo will be maintained.'

**Dollar pauses for breath after US data, eyes on French and British economies**
The dollar paused near a two-month high against a basket of peers on Friday, as traders digested the latest inflation and jobs data. The euro was down 0.06 per cent at US$1.10931, while the dollar was up 0.3 per cent on the Japanese yen at 149.02. Lee Hardman, senior currency analyst at MUFG, said, 'The data yesterday from the US has taken some of the upward momentum out of the dollar, though in terms of the impact on Fed policy making, we think it’s pretty limited.' Britain's economy grew in August, but the pound was broadly steady on the dollar and little changed on the euro. Traders are watching French politics, after the government delivered its 2025 budget with plans for US$65.5 billion worth of spending cuts and tax hikes. The budget is unlikely to pass until December, and ratings agency Fitch is scheduled to update its view on France's debt late on Friday, which could trigger a short-term reaction. Markets are also awaiting a news conference from China's finance ministry on fiscal policy on Saturday. The Australian dollar was last down 0.1 per cent on the day at US$0.6734, and set for a weekly fall of 0.9 per cent. The New Zealand dollar was at US$0.6092, set for a weekly fall of more than 1 per cent, due to the central bank slashing rates by a half point and hinting at further cuts to come.

**Exchange Rate Fluctuations: Implications for the Global Economy**
The exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro has significant implications for the global economy, as both currencies are widely used in international transactions. Monitoring this exchange rate is crucial for minimizing risks and maximizing benefits in a globalized environment. According to the latest data, 1 US dollar is equivalent to 0.91025 euros, while 1 euro requires 1.09855 US dollars to purchase. These fluctuations in the exchange rate are indicative of how economic changes, Federal Reserve and European Central Bank policies, and geopolitical and socio-economic events affect currency valuations. Staying up-to-date with the exchange rate is essential for global economic agents, facilitating informed and appropriate decision-making in a complex economic landscape. This adjustment reflects the impacts of various challenges, such as declining purchasing power and decreasing external demand. Despite these challenges, a gradual recovery is anticipated, driven by improvements in inflation conditions and a stable labor market. Additionally, a slowdown in inflation is expected, contrasting with previous high expectations. The EU's annual inflation rate is estimated to fall to 3.0% in 2024 and 2.5% in 2025, with a similar trend in the eurozone. This change is largely due to a decline in energy prices and a relaxation of price pressures on goods and services. This trend represents a relief for the economy, paving the way for a gradual stabilization of prices. However, the economic landscape is marked by notable uncertainty, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and potential impacts of commercial disruptions. Factors such as climate risks and increased incidence of extreme weather events also contribute to this uncertainty, presenting additional challenges for the EU and eurozone economies, affecting potential growth and inflation projections, and complicating medium-term economic recovery prospects.

**Euro Celebrates 25 Years: A Resilient Currency in a Turbulent Global Economy**
The recent exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro has placed the dollar at 0.90405 euros and the euro at 1.10615 dollars. This type of exchange rate is a thermometer of the global economy, affecting not only the commercial relations between Europe and the US, but also investment decisions and citizens who seek to change their currencies for travel or other conveniences. The euro is the official currency of 20 European Union countries and has shown notable resilience in the face of global economic instability. According to Consilium Europa, the euro is the currency chosen by some countries for loans and reserves in central banks worldwide, representing 20.5% of global foreign exchange reserves in 2022, compared to 58.4% for the US dollar. The European Commission's recent review of economic forecasts for 2024 indicates a slowdown in the economic recovery of the European Union and the eurozone, adjusting growth rates to lower levels than previously anticipated. For 2023, a growth rate of 0.5% is expected, with a slight improvement in 2024 but still below previous expectations. This slowdown is influenced by several adverse factors, including reductions in purchasing power and weaker external demand, although a gradual recovery is expected, supported by declining inflation and a favorable labor market. In relation to inflation, projections point to a more rapid reduction than estimated, with a downward trend expected to continue until reaching more sustainable levels by 2025.

According to recent data, 1 US dollar is equivalent to 0.89955 euros, while 1 euro requires 1.11165 US dollars. These fluctuations in the exchange rate are indicative of how economic changes, policies from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, and geopolitical and socio-economic events impact currency valuation. Staying up-to-date with exchange rates is essential for global economic agents, facilitating informed decision-making in a complex economic landscape. Economic forecasts for 2024 indicate a slowdown in the European Union's economic recovery and the eurozone, adjusting growth rate expectations to lower levels than previously anticipated. The European Commission's recent review of economic forecasts for 2024 suggests a 0.5% growth rate for 2023, with a slight improvement in 2024 but still below previous expectations. This slowdown is influenced by several adverse factors, including reduced purchasing power and weaker external demand, although a gradual recovery is expected, supported by declining inflation and a favorable labor market. Inflation projections point to a more rapid decline than estimated, with a downward trend expected to continue until reaching more sustainable levels by 2025. This decrease is primarily due to falling energy prices and reduced pressure on consumer prices, suggesting a path towards economic stabilization. However, the economic context is affected by significant uncertainty due to external factors, such as ongoing geopolitical tensions and potential effects of trade disruptions, as well as climate change and extreme weather events. These factors could influence the projected growth and inflation trajectories, adding an element of risk to expectations of economic recovery in the EU and eurozone in the short to medium term. The euro has proven to be a robust currency, maintaining its position as the second most important currency in the international monetary system, 25 years after its launch. According to Consilium Europa, the euro constitutes 20.5% of official foreign exchange reserves worldwide, compared to 58.4% for the US dollar.

**US Dollar vs Euro Exchange Rate: A Crucial Measure of Economic Stability**
The exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro plays a crucial role in serving as a measure between the economy and stability between Europe and the United States. This exchange rate can affect international trade transactions, determining purchasing power and competitiveness. Its follow-up is vital for investors, multinational companies, and economic authorities, but also for those who want to make transactions at exchange offices for everyday situations such as a trip abroad. In the last session, the foreign exchange market presented movements in both currencies: the US dollar and the euro. According to the latest data, 1 US dollar is equivalent to 0.89580 euros, while to acquire 1 euro, 1.11635 US dollars are needed. This exchange rate reflects how economic fluctuations, monetary policies adopted by the Federal Reserve of the United States and the European Central Bank, as well as geopolitical and socio-economic events, can influence the valuation of currencies. A deep and updated knowledge of the exchange rate is essential for those participating in the global economy, allowing for more informed and timely decisions in an economically constantly evolving environment. The European economy and the euro zone experienced a weaker start than expected in 2024, adjusting growth expectations to 0.5% for 2023 and projecting a moderate increase for the following years, with 0.9% in the EU and 0.8% in the euro zone in 2024, before reaching a more robust growth in 2025. This adjustment reflects the impacts of various challenges, such as the weakening of purchasing power and a decreasing external demand. Despite these challenges, a gradual recovery is anticipated, driven by improvements in inflation conditions and a stable labor market. On the other hand, a predictable deceleration of inflation is observed, contrasting with higher forecasts from last autumn. The annual inflation rate in the EU is estimated to fall to 3.0% in 2024 and 2.5% in 2025, with a similar trend in the euro zone. This change is largely due to the decline in energy prices and a relaxation in price pressures on goods and services. This trend represents a relief for the economy, opening the way to a gradual stabilization of prices. Finally, the economic landscape is marked by notable uncertainty, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and potential impacts of commercial disruptions. Factors such as climate risks and an increased incidence of extreme weather events also contribute to this uncertainty. These elements present additional challenges for the EU economy and the euro zone, potentially affecting growth and inflation projections and complicating medium-term economic recovery prospects. The euro has demonstrated notable resilience against marked economic instability worldwide. A quarter of a century after its launch, it is the second most influential currency after the US dollar. According to Consilium Europa, the euro is the currency that some countries have chosen to make loans and reserves in central banks worldwide, representing 20.5% of global foreign exchange reserves in 2022, according to constant exchange rates, compared to 58.4% of the US dollar.

**Euro Exchange Rate and Economic Projections: A Complex Picture**
The exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro has significant implications for the global economy, as both currencies are widely used in international transactions. Monitoring this exchange rate is crucial for minimizing risks and maximizing benefits in a globalized environment. According to the European Commission, the EU and eurozone economies have started 2024 with slower growth than expected, revising down growth forecasts to 0.5% and 0.9% respectively for 2023, and 0.8% for 2024 in the eurozone. However, a recovery is expected for 2025, with growth forecasts of 1.7% in the EU and 1.5% in the eurozone. Factors such as declining household purchasing power and falling external demand have contributed to the slowdown, but a rebound is anticipated driven by lower inflation, real wage growth, and a resilient labor market. Inflation is also showing signs of deceleration, with predictions indicating a significant decrease from 6.3% in 2023 to 3.0% in 2024 and 2.5% in 2025 in the EU, and a similar trend in the eurozone. This decline in inflation is attributed mainly to the reduction in energy prices and a general decrease in price pressures. However, these economic projections face uncertainties, particularly due to prolonged geopolitical tensions and the risks associated with rising transportation costs and potential new bottlenecks in supply. These factors, along with climate-related risks and the possibility of extreme weather events, could influence economic growth and inflation, adding to the uncertainty in current predictions. As the euro celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2024, it remains a symbol of the freedom that the European Union provides to its citizens, reflecting the path towards greater economic unification and stability in Europe, despite the challenges it has faced, such as the pandemic and Brexit. The euro has also maintained its position as the second most important currency, after the US dollar, and is preferred by several countries for use in their central banks' reserves.
