2024-11-06 13:16:36,275 - INFO - Question: Will the CDC report more than 80% of the tested influenza sequences as influenza A during the 2024-25 season through the week ending Dec 21, 2024?
2024-11-06 13:16:36,276 - INFO - Reasoning for question 29591:
To generate a prediction, let's first evaluate the historical percentages for the proportion of influenza A versus all influenza cases, using the available background data for influenza A % at the end of prior seasons:

1. **Historical Reference Comparison**: 
    - In the 2023-24 season, the final percentage was 69.1%.
    - The 2022-23 and 2021-22 seasons had significantly higher final percentages, 98.2% and 98.4%, respectively.
  
2. **Vaccine Effectiveness**: 
    - Current reports suggest that the flu vaccine may be less effective this year, particularly with a 35% efficacy reported in South America. Lower vaccine effectiveness could influence which flu virus types become more prevalent.

3. **Current Season Context**:
    - Articles indicate a potentially intense flu season, influenced by factors like new COVID variants and the possibility of more influenza A variants in circulation.
    - Data from Australia, often a precursor for trends in the Northern Hemisphere, shows record-high case numbers, which might suggest similar surges in influenza A, given that Australia sees similar virus strains.

4. **Recent Trends and External Advice**:
    - News references escalate health concerns related to influenza, guided largely by strains within influenza A, specifically types like A(H1N1) and A(H3N2), often suggesting a larger proportion of influenza A variants, but not decidedly skewed entirely toward influenza A.

5. **CDC Surveillance Data**: 
    - The season just starting and early indicators for influenza types have not yet pointed distinctly toward one type reaching predominant levels like those seen in some past years where over 90% of cases were influenza A.

6. **Balanced Analysis**:
    - The current situation suggests that influenza A is likely to be a significant proportion of cases, but various factors, including potential vaccine inefficacy and historical oscillation, indicate the percentage might not exceed 80% by late December 2024.
    - Given the historical fluctuation and combined potential trends for both influenza A and other factors (e.g., unpredictable variance in influenza B activity), a prudential estimate slightly under the critical threshold is warranted.

My Prediction: Between 64.00% and 77.00%, but 74.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Historical Base Rates:
- 2023-24 season: 69.1% Influenza A
- 2022-23 season: 98.2% Influenza A
- 2021-22 season: 98.4% Influenza A

2. Key Evidence Supporting Higher Percentage (>80%):
- Recent history shows very high Influenza A percentages in 2021-2023
- Of hospitalizations in 2023-24, 84.6% were Influenza A despite lower overall prevalence
- The CDC report about South American countries suggests similar viral strains may circulate
- Early season tends to be dominated by Influenza A, with B waves typically coming later

3. Key Evidence Supporting Lower Percentage (<80%):
- Most recent season (2023-24) showed much lower Influenza A percentage at 69.1%
- Australian data shows record high flu cases, suggesting possible strain diversity
- The CDC's vaccine targeting decisions suggest they expect both A and B strains
- Historical pattern shows 11 of 25 years had two waves, with 8 having B waves

4. Current Situation Analysis:
- Season will only be measured through December 21, 2024
- Early-season timing favors Influenza A dominance
- Vaccine efficacy is expected to be lower (35% in Southern Hemisphere)
- CDC forecasts expect peak activity around December-January

5. Weighing Factors:
- The timing (through December 21) is crucial - this is typically before B waves emerge
- Recent years show very high A percentages, but 2023-24 broke this pattern
- The limited timeframe increases likelihood of A dominance
- Early season dynamics historically favor Influenza A

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 88.90%, with 82.30% being the most likely. Probability: 82.30%.

To forecast the probability that the CDC will report more than 80% of the tested influenza sequences as influenza A during the 2024-25 season through the week ending Dec 21, 2024, we need to analyze various factors and historical data related to influenza trends.

### Historical Context:
1. **Base Rates of Past Seasons**: 
   - In recent seasons, the percentage of influenza A cases was 69.1% for 2023-24, 98.2% for 2022-23, and 98.4% for 2021-22 during the peak flu season through the week ending in early May.
   - Historically, influenza tends to be predominantly type A, particularly in the earlier part of the flu season. The data indicates high variability in the dominance of influenza A.

2. **Current Season Trends**:
   - From the news articles and current season data, it's noted that respiratory illnesses are expected to pick up in December 2024.
   - Predicted vaccine efficacy for the Northern Hemisphere may be lower, which could influence influenza spread patterns and hospitalization, often dominated by influenza A.
   - In previous dual wave seasons, influenza B typically contributed to the second wave.

### Considerations:
1. **Influenza Trends and Vaccine Efficacy**:
   - Vaccine efficacy may influence which strains are more prevalent. If the vaccine is less effective against type B, we might see a higher proportion of type A early on.
   - Lower vaccine uptake in some regions may also contribute to higher transmission, often dominated by traditional circulating strains like A (H1N1).

2. **Causal Forces**:
   - In the Southern Hemisphere, Australia reported a severe season, providing some indication of potential similar trends in the Northern Hemisphere.
   - COVID-19 dynamics and their impacts on influenza patterns should also be considered, though historically influenza A has shown resilience in dominance in past pandemics.

3. **Public Health Responses**:
   - Encouraging vaccine uptake before peak seasons could potentially lessen the burden of influenza A, though behavioral factors might limit impact.

### Balancing Evidence:
- Historically, the dominance of influenza A remains strong, particularly early in the flu season.
- The majority of hospitalization cases historically align with influenza A, suggesting possible suppressive factors on influenza B spread.

### Extrapolation:
To extrapolate from these data points, as most of the features align with influenza A historically dominating, and given no unexpectedly strong indication of a significant shift favoring influenza B based on current evidence, it appears more likely that the percentage of influenza A by this date could exceed 80%.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 85.00%, but 82.50% being the most likely. Probability: 82.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let's establish the base rate from recent seasons:
- 2023-24: 69.1% Influenza A
- 2022-23: 98.2% Influenza A
- 2021-22: 98.4% Influenza A

2. Key factors favoring higher Influenza A percentage:
- Historical pattern shows Influenza A typically dominates early season
- CDC reports show 8 of 11 seasons with two waves had Influenza B as second wave, suggesting A dominates early
- Recent years (2021-2023) showed very high Influenza A percentages
- Current season started with high Influenza A numbers in Australia

3. Key factors favoring lower Influenza A percentage:
- 2023-24 season showed much lower Influenza A percentage (69.1%)
- CDC notes increasing genetic diversity in H3N2 clades
- Reports indicate vaccine effectiveness may be lower this year
- Recent data shows more balanced A/B distribution compared to previous years

4. Timing considerations:
- Question specifically asks about period through December 21, 2024
- Early season typically favors Influenza A
- Peak usually occurs December-February
- We're looking at early season data only

5. Recent trends and signals:
- Australian data shows high overall flu activity
- CDC forecasts similar or lower hospitalization rates compared to last season
- Early season reports show moderate activity levels
- Vaccine matching may be less effective this year

Given the early-season timing (through December 21) when Influenza A typically dominates, but considering the recent trend toward more balanced A/B distribution and lower vaccine effectiveness, I expect numbers higher than last year's 69.1% but lower than the 98%+ seen in 2021-2023.

To forecast whether the CDC will report more than 80% of tested influenza sequences as influenza A during the 2024-25 season through the week ending December 21, 2024, I will systematically assess the available data and relevant factors.

### Historical Context
1. **Base Rates**: Historically, high percentages of influenza cases are caused by Influenza A: 
   - 2023-24: 69.1%
   - 2022-23: 98.2%
   - 2021-22: 98.4%
   - Long-term historical data indicates that Influenza A often dominates early in the flu season compared to Influenza B.

### Current Data and Analysis
2. **Current Flu Season Dynamics**: The 2023-2024 data indicated a reduced proportion of Influenza A (69.1%) compared to the previous two seasons, possibly hinting at increased Influenza B presence.
3. **Australia’s Flu Season** (as an indicator for the Northern Hemisphere): This season saw a record number of cases, potentially suggesting a severe flu season, but the specific breakdown between Influenza A and B isn't fully detailed in the articles.
4. **Vaccine Composition**: The trivalent vaccine targeting two types of Influenza A might indicate a substantial expectation of Influenza A prevalence.
5. **Historical Dual Waves**: Historical patterns where influenza B led the second wave affect the probability, but before December typically sees prominence of Influenza A strains.

### Other Influencing Factors
6. **Vaccine Ineffectiveness**: Lower vaccine efficacy could indicate higher infection rates with Influenza A, particularly if it is dominant.
7. **Environmental and Societal Factors**: Warmer temperatures possibly delaying flu peaks and the mixed impact of COVID-19 on general immune system resilience could affect flu trends. 

### Evidence Weighing
- **In Favor of Low Influenza A Proportion**: The percentage in 2023-24 was significantly lower than the seasons before. The potential for an early Influenza B wave exists, given the historical context of dual-wave seasons. 
- **In Favor of High Influenza A Proportion**: The early flu season typically sees more Influenza A. Plus, the trivalent vaccine focus reinforces this. Historical data often shows a higher rate of Influenza A at this time of the season.

### Considerations on Current Trends
- The data from earlier flu seasons and experts suggesting a potential delay in the peak imply Influenza A's early visibility could fluctuate. However, historical data underscores likely dominance by the end of December.

### Final Probability Assessment
Considering these factors, the probability of more than 80% of the tested influenza sequences being Influenza A by the specified period remains relatively high but uncertain. Weighing historical dominance and present influencing factors leads me to favor a moderately high outcome but with an upward uncertainty range.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

- **In Favor of High Influenza A Proportion**: The early flu season typically sees more Influenza A. Plus, the trivalent vaccine focus reinforces this. Historical data often shows a higher rate of Influenza A at this time of the season.

### Considerations on Current Trends
- The data from earlier flu seasons and experts suggesting a potential delay in the peak imply Influenza A's early visibility could fluctuate. However, historical data underscores likely dominance by the end of December.

### Final Probability Assessment
Considering these factors, the probability of more than 80% of the tested influenza sequences being Influenza A by the specified period remains relatively high but uncertain. Weighing historical dominance and present influencing factors leads me to favor a moderately high outcome but with an upward uncertainty range.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To forecast whether the CDC will report more than 80% of tested influenza sequences as influenza A during the 2024-25 season through the week ending December 21, 2024, I will systematically assess the available data and relevant factors.

### Historical Context
1. **Base Rates**: Historically, high percentages of influenza cases are caused by Influenza A: 
   - 2023-24: 69.1%
   - 2022-23: 98.2%
   - 2021-22: 98.4%
   - Long-term historical data indicates that Influenza A often dominates early in the flu season compared to Influenza B.

### Current Data and Analysis
2. **Current Flu Season Dynamics**: The 2023-2024 data indicated a reduced proportion of Influenza A (69.1%) compared to the previous two seasons, possibly hinting at increased Influenza B presence.
3. **Australia’s Flu Season** (as an indicator for the Northern Hemisphere): This season saw a record number of cases, potentially suggesting a severe flu season, but the specific breakdown between Influenza A and B isn't fully detailed in the articles.
4. **Vaccine Composition**: The trivalent vaccine targeting two types of Influenza A might indicate a substantial expectation of Influenza A prevalence.
5. **Historical Dual Waves**: Historical patterns where influenza B led the second wave affect the probability, but before December typically sees prominence of Influenza A strains.

### Other Influencing Factors
6. **Vaccine Ineffectiveness**: Lower vaccine efficacy could indicate higher infection rates with Influenza A, particularly if it is dominant.
7. **Environmental and Societal Factors**: Warmer temperatures possibly delaying flu peaks and the mixed impact of COVID-19 on general immune system resilience could affect flu trends.

1. Historical Base Rates:
- 2023-24 season: 69.1% Influenza A
- 2022-23 season: 98.2% Influenza A
- 2021-22 season: 98.4% Influenza A

2. Key Evidence For Higher Percentage (>80%):
- Historical pattern shows very high Influenza A percentages in recent years
- Influenza A tends to dominate early season (through December)
- CDC data shows Influenza A causes disproportionate hospitalizations (84.6% in 2023-24)
- Vaccine composition targeting two Influenza A strains suggests expected prominence

3. Key Evidence For Lower Percentage (<80%):
- 2023-24 season showed much lower Influenza A percentage (69.1%)
- Australian 2024 data shows record high overall cases but doesn't specify type
- CDC predicting similar or lower severity compared to 2023-24
- Flu vaccine efficacy in Southern Hemisphere was only 35%, suggesting possible strain mismatch

4. Special Considerations:
- Question focuses specifically on period through December 21, 2024
- Early season typically favors Influenza A
- CDC reports showing low overall flu activity currently
- Multiple news sources indicating expected peak in December

5. Analysis:
- Base rate from recent years suggests high Influenza A percentage
- However, 2023-24 season shows potential shift in pattern
- Early season timing favors Influenza A
- Multiple indicators suggest moderate season similar to 2023-24
- Need to account for uncertainty given vaccine efficacy reports

To forecast whether the CDC will report more than 80% of the tested influenza sequences as influenza A during the 2024-25 season through the week ending Dec 21, 2024, let's analyze the situation with the available data:

### Base Rates and Historical Data
1. **Historical Trends:** Historically, the proportion of influenza cases identified as influenza A by the end of the flu season has been high. In the past three years, the percentage of influenza A was:
   - 2023-24: 69.1%
   - 2022-23: 98.2%
   - 2021-22: 98.4%

   Flu seasons starting in September often see a mix of influenza A and B, with influenza A usually dominant initially.

2. **Vaccine and Current Trends:** The trivalent vaccine targets two strains of influenza A and one of influenza B, possibly improving detection and control of influenza A strains. However, the vaccine efficiency appears to be somewhat reduced this year.

3. **Recent Reports and Insights:**
    - The high vaccination uptake in Australia and the number of cases might signal higher detection and circulation of influenza A, affecting the surveillance numbers.
    - Seasonal influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) are anticipated to be the most circulated strains based on vaccine composition.
    - Inconsistent vaccination enthusiasm among healthcare workers may influence the spread/detection of influenza strains but the significance is unclear.

4. **Present Context and Variable Analysis:**
   - The presence of other circulating respiratory viruses, such as RSV and potentially confusing symptoms, could reduce the proportion of influenza A in tested sequences.
   - Media and CDC concerns about the potential intensity of this flu season hint at unpredictable trends.
   - Although data supportive of high influenza A dominance have been observed in the past, CDC instructions show a substantial part of cases could derive from A in initial months.
   - Reports on record flu cases in Australia hint at volatility in strain distribution but suggest a high proportion of influenza A.

### Risk Balancing
- **Underreacting to Early Data:** The recent influenza data and influenza A dominance trends could be signaling an early pattern that holds as the season sets in.
- **Overreacting to Variability Concerns:** While record seasons and mixed virus signals might suggest uncertainty, historical patterns usually show strong early-season influenza A dominance.

### Forecast 
Based on the analysis, consistently high rates of influenza A in recent recovery phases suggest significant influenza A activity. However, variability in initial season uptake could result in values slightly below thresholds if late-arriving influenza B waves occur or strain competition varies.

My Prediction: Based on these considerations, the chance of the CDC reporting more than 80% of tested influenza sequences as influenza A through December 21, 2024 rests substantially on historical precedence and current reports, though recent trends hint at a decline probability magnitude. 

My Prediction: Between 68.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To forecast whether the CDC will report more than 80% of the tested influenza sequences as influenza A during the 2024-25 season through the week ending Dec 21, 2024, let's analyze the situation with the available data:

### Base Rates and Historical Data
1. **Historical Trends:** Historically, the proportion of influenza cases identified as influenza A by the end of the flu season has been high. In the past three years, the percentage of influenza A was:
   - 2023-24: 69.1%
   - 2022-23: 98.2%
   - 2021-22: 98.4%

   Flu seasons starting in September often see a mix of influenza A and B, with influenza A usually dominant initially.

2. **Vaccine and Current Trends:** The trivalent vaccine targets two strains of influenza A and one of influenza B, possibly improving detection and control of influenza A strains. However, the vaccine efficiency appears to be somewhat reduced this year.

3. **Recent Reports and Insights:**
    - The high vaccination uptake in Australia and the number of cases might signal higher detection and circulation of influenza A, affecting the surveillance numbers.
    - Seasonal influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) are anticipated to be the most circulated strains based on vaccine composition.
    - Inconsistent vaccination enthusiasm among healthcare workers may influence the spread/detection of influenza strains but the significance is unclear.

4. **Present Context and Variable Analysis:**
   - The presence of other circulating respiratory viruses, such as RSV and potentially confusing symptoms, could reduce the proportion of influenza A in tested sequences.
   - Media and CDC concerns about the potential intensity of this flu season hint at unpredictable trends.
   - Although data supportive of high influenza A dominance have been observed in the past, CDC instructions show a substantial part of cases could derive from A in initial months.
   - Reports on record flu cases in Australia hint at volatility in strain distribution but suggest a high proportion of influenza A.

### Risk Balancing
- **Underreacting to Early Data:** The recent influenza data and influenza A dominance trends could be signaling an early pattern that holds as the season sets in.
- **Overreacting to Variability Concerns:** While record seasons and mixed virus signals might suggest uncertainty, historical patterns usually show strong early-season influenza A dominance.

### Forecast 
Based on the analysis, consistently high rates of influenza A in recent recovery phases suggest significant influenza A activity. However, variability in initial season uptake could result in values slightly below thresholds if late-arriving influenza B waves occur or strain competition varies.

My Prediction: Based on these considerations, the chance of the CDC reporting more than 80% of tested influenza sequences as influenza A through December 21, 2024 rests substantially on historical precedence and current reports, though recent trends hint at a decline probability magnitude. 

My Prediction: Between 68.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Historical Base Rate Analysis:
- 2023-24 season ended with 69.1% Influenza A
- 2022-23 season ended with 98.2% Influenza A
- 2021-22 season ended with 98.4% Influenza A
- Early season (through December) tends to have higher Influenza A percentages compared to full season

2. Recent Evidence:
- Australian flu season (predictor for Northern Hemisphere) showed record high cases in 2024
- CDC reports current flu activity is low but increasing
- Vaccine effectiveness predictions are lower (35% in Southern Hemisphere)
- Experts predict peak in December 2024

3. Key Factors Supporting Higher than 80%:
- Early season timing (through Dec 21) historically favors Influenza A
- Past two seasons showed very high Influenza A percentages (>98%)
- Early season typically shows less Influenza B activity

4. Key Factors Supporting Lower than 80%:
- 2023-24 season showed much lower Influenza A percentage (69.1%)
- 11 of last 25 seasons had two waves, with 8 having Influenza B second waves
- Lower vaccine effectiveness could lead to more variant strains circulating

5. Special Considerations:
- Question focuses on early season (through Dec 21, 2024)
- Data from Southern Hemisphere suggests potentially different strain patterns
- CDC reporting indicates preparation for significant flu season

Looking at these factors:
- The early season timing strongly suggests higher Influenza A percentage than full season
- Recent years trend suggests >80% is likely
- However, last season's drop to 69.1% suggests increased variability

3. Key Factors Supporting Higher than 80%:
- Early season timing (through Dec 21) historically favors Influenza A
- Past two seasons showed very high Influenza A percentages (>98%)
- Early season typically shows less Influenza B activity

4. Key Factors Supporting Lower than 80%:
- 2023-24 season showed much lower Influenza A percentage (69.1%)
- 11 of last 25 seasons had two waves, with 8 having Influenza B second waves
- Lower vaccine effectiveness could lead to more variant strains circulating

5. Special Considerations:
- Question focuses on early season (through Dec 21, 2024)
- Data from Southern Hemisphere suggests potentially different strain patterns
- CDC reporting indicates preparation for significant flu season

Looking at these factors:
- The early season timing strongly suggests higher Influenza A percentage than full season
- Recent years trend suggests >80% is likely
- However, last season's drop to 69.1% suggests increased variability

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 88.90%, with 82.30% being the most likely. Probability: 82.30%

2024-11-06 13:18:04,804 - INFO - Reasoning for question 29591:
To forecast whether the CDC will report more than 80% of the tested influenza sequences as influenza A during the 2024-25 season through the week ending Dec 21, 2024, we can examine the following factors:

1. **Historical Base Rates**: Historically, influenza A has accounted for varying proportions of positive specimens at the end of flu seasons. Recent data shows that in prior years, Influenza A accounted for:
   - 69.1% in 2023-2024
   - 98.2% in 2022-2023
   - 98.4% in 2021-2022
   
   While these figures pertain to full flu seasons, they offer insight into the prevalence of influenza A in prior years.

2. **Current Season Trends**: We must consider whether the current season may deviate from these trends. The vaccines developed for the 2024-25 season target two influenza A strains, suggesting a focus on combating influenza A's anticipated prevalence.

3. **Nature of Influenza Viruses**: Influenza A is typically responsible for more pandemics and larger outbreaks compared to influenza B, which can affect these percentages.

4. **News Reports and their implications**:
   - Reports indicate a severe flu season in Australia with a significant number of cases, which might suggest a strong presence of influenza A if similar strains are spreading in the U.S.
   - Articles indicate that a range of influenza viruses is circulating, with a greater focus on influenza A historically.
   - While there are mentions of non-influenza-like illnesses, these add complexity to overall severity but not necessarily to virus type proportions.
   
5. **Weather and Flu Season Timing**: Weather conditions and their impact on the timing of the influenza peak can influence the reporting percentages. Cool, damp conditions typically help the flu season gain momentum.

6. **Flu Vaccine Effectiveness**: Reports of potentially less effective vaccines and fluctuating vaccination rates might affect the overall spread of influenza A and B strains, impacting the detection rates.

7. **Current Vaccination Drive and Public Health Advisories**: High vaccination coverage against influenza A could potentially lower its spread but also means fewer hospitalizations, altering visible trends in results.

Based on these factors, I will start with a midpoint probability based on historical data (e.g., 69.1% to 98.4%) and adjust slightly downward recognizing the potential variability and uncertainty specific to this flu season. The existence of outlier years such as 2023-2024 must also be considered while adjusting this assessment.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

2024-11-06 13:18:04,819 - INFO - Reasoning for question 29591:
Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Looking at recent seasons through Week 18:
2023-24: 69.1% Influenza A
2022-23: 98.2% Influenza A
2021-22: 98.4% Influenza A

2. Timing Considerations:
- Question asks about period through December 21, 2024 (early season)
- This is different from the full-season numbers above
- Early season typically has higher Influenza A percentages

3. Key Evidence For Higher Percentage:
- Early season timing favors Influenza A
- Australian data shows record flu season in 2024
- CDC reports from Southern Hemisphere suggest similar virus strains
- Historical pattern shows Influenza B waves typically come later in season

4. Key Evidence For Lower Percentage:
- Vaccine effectiveness is predicted to be lower (35% vs 51.9% last year)
- Last season showed lower Influenza A percentage (69.1%)
- CDC forecasts suggest possibly milder season overall
- Some reports indicate changing patterns post-pandemic

5. Special Considerations:
- Post-pandemic patterns may be less reliable
- 11 of 25 past seasons had two waves
- 8 of those had second wave as Influenza B, but typically later than December
- Current season starting slower than usual due to warm fall

Given:
- Early season timing strongly favors Influenza A
- Historical patterns suggest >80% for early season
- But recent season showed lower percentages
- Southern Hemisphere data suggests strong flu season

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 88.90%, with 82.30% being the most likely. Probability: 82.30%.
2024-11-06 13:18:04,819 - INFO - Reasoning for question 29591:
Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Looking at recent seasons through Week 18:
2023-24: 69.1% Influenza A
2022-23: 98.2% Influenza A
2021-22: 98.4% Influenza A

2. Timing Considerations:
- Question asks about period through December 21, 2024 (early season)
- This is different from the full-season numbers above
- Early season typically has higher Influenza A percentages

3. Key Evidence For Higher Percentage:
- Early season timing favors Influenza A
- Australian data shows record flu season in 2024
- CDC reports from Southern Hemisphere suggest similar virus strains
- Historical pattern shows Influenza B waves typically come later in season

4. Key Evidence For Lower Percentage:
- Vaccine effectiveness is predicted to be lower (35% vs 51.9% last year)
- Last season showed lower Influenza A percentage (69.1%)
- CDC forecasts suggest possibly milder season overall
- Some reports indicate changing patterns post-pandemic

5. Special Considerations:
- Post-pandemic patterns may be less reliable
- 11 of 25 past seasons had two waves
- 8 of those had second wave as Influenza B, but typically later than December
- Current season starting slower than usual due to warm fall

Given:
- Early season timing strongly favors Influenza A
- Historical patterns suggest >80% for early season
- But recent season showed lower percentages
- Southern Hemisphere data suggests strong flu season
