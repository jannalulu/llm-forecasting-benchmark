**Romania's Presidential Election: Far-Right Candidate Surges into Runoff with TikTok's Help**
Romania's presidential election first-round vote saw a surprise rise of a far-right candidate, Calin Georgescu, who is pro-Russian, into the runoff. The country's telecom regulator has called for a temporary ban on TikTok until an investigation into allegations of election interference is completed. According to Reuters, Georgescu, 62, was polling in single digits before the vote, but surged into the runoff after the vote, and will face centrist candidate Elena Lasconi in the second round on December 8. Georgescu's campaign heavily relied on TikTok, a video-sharing platform, to reach young people and overseas Romanian expats. Pavel Popescu, deputy head of Romania's telecom regulator, said, 'I urge the temporary suspension of TikTok in Romania from November 28 until the completion of the investigation into the manipulation of the electoral process.' The National Audiovisual Council of Romania has already asked the European Commission to investigate TikTok's role in the election, citing allegations of 'manipulating public opinion.'

**There’s a simple explanation for Calin Georgescu’s ‘shock’ triumph in Romania**
Calin Georgescu, a 'far-right, pro-Russian candidate', has taken a surprise lead in Romania's presidential election. Georgescu, who won almost 23% of the vote, tapped into the concerns of ordinary Romanians, particularly elderly people, who are struggling with high inflation and economic hardships. He made a link between the war in Ukraine and Romania's economic struggles, and promised to reduce imports and give more support to agriculture. Georgescu's campaign was focused on Romania's interests, rather than loyalty to supra-national organizations like the EU and Nato. His success has been met with shock and horror from western liberal-elite circles, but it is understandable given the disconnect between the concerns of ordinary Romanians and the policies of the incumbent parties. Georgescu's message of social conservatism, patriotism, and economic populism has resonated with voters, and he is likely to do well in the second round of voting on December 8.

Around one thousand students and activists gathered at University Square in central Bucharest to protest against pro-Russian independent candidate Calin Georgescu, who led in the first round of the presidential race with 22.94 percent of the total number of votes. The protesters are concerned about Georgescu's views, which they see as a threat to Romania's democracy. The second round of the presidential election will be held on December 8, 2024. According to the protesters, Georgescu's victory would be a 'disaster' for the country. 'We cannot let a pro-Russian candidate win the presidency,' said one of the protesters. 'It would be a disaster for Romania's democracy and sovereignty.' The protesters are calling for Georgescu to be disqualified from the election. 'We demand that the electoral authorities take action against Georgescu and ensure that the election is fair and transparent,' said another protester. The protesters' message is clear: they will not let Georgescu win without a fight.

**Pro-Russian Candidate Calin Georgescu Wins First Round of Romanian Presidential Elections**
In a surprise turn of events, pro-Russian candidate Calin Georgescu won the first round of the presidential elections in Romania with 22.94% of the votes, followed by right-wing candidate Elena Lasconi with 19.17%. Current Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, who is a member of the Social Democratic Party, presented his resignation as party leader after the poor results. Georgescu, who has 3.4 million followers on TikTok, announced that he has 'lit the candle of hope and courage to be Romanian. The Romanian people have chosen to stop kneeling, not to be humiliated.' He also stated that 'the Romanian people shouted 'peace' tonight, and they did it very loudly.' Georgescu will face Lasconi in the second round on December 8. Lasconi, a former journalist and mayor of Campulung, has a strong nationalist, liberal, pro-European, and pro-NATO message. Ciolacu, on the other hand, will not participate in the second round, saying that 'the rules of democracy and the importance of this second round are much greater than our personal interests.' Georgescu's victory comes at a time when there is a growing fear of rupture in NATO and the European Union following Donald Trump's victory in the US. He has previously stated that Ukraine is 'a country invented' and that Vladimir Putin is 'a man who loves his country' and 'someone who understands very well the diplomatic angles, dominates them, and is surrounded by highly qualified professionals.' He also advocates for Romania's withdrawal from NATO, believing that the Alliance would not defend it in case of an invasion. Additionally, Georgescu is an open defender of known Nazi collaborators from World War II, including Ion Antonescu and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, whom he considers 'national heroes.'

Georgescu, who is not affiliated with any party, campaigned on the promise to stop aid to Ukraine and to 'end Romania's dependence on the EU and NATO.' Many have labeled Georgescu as 'pro-Russian,' and his victory has raised concerns about the possible outcome of the second round of the election.

Călin Georgescu, a populist candidate, has won the first round of the Romanian presidential election, surprising the political landscape in Romania. According to his website, Georgescu holds a Ph.D. in pedology and has held various positions in the Romanian Ministry of Environment in the 1990s. He received around 23% of the votes, more than double the predicted amount by polling institutes, surpassing Elena Lasconi of the 'Union sauvez la Roumanie' party and Marcel Ciolacu, the current Prime Minister, by a narrow margin. Ciolacu has resigned as leader of the PSD party, a historic and powerful party in Romania, marking the first time in 35 years that the party will not have a candidate in the second round of a presidential election. Georgescu's campaign focused on social media, particularly TikTok, where he gained significant support.

Lascornic came second with 26.82%, and George Simion, the leader of 'Alliance for the Union of Romanians', came third with 12.07%. Since no candidate reached the 50% threshold required to win in the first round, a second round will take place on December 8, in which Georgescu and Lascornic will participate. This marks the first time since the fall of the regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu that a social democrat has not participated in the second round of the presidential election in Romania. Georgescu's press secretary said, 'It was a great day.' However, in a statement, Georgescu's press secretary did not make this statement. The Kremlin is following the presidential election in Romania, but is not making any predictions, said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Georgescu, who is a supporter of a union with Russia, has outperformed Ciolacu in the presidential election in Romania, reports Financial Times. According to the Financial Times, a political earthquake has occurred in these elections. Political analyst Rar said, 'The liberal ideology of the EU cannot cope with modern challenges.'

**Călin Georgescu Wins First Round of Romanian Presidential Election**
Independent candidate Călin Georgescu won the first round of the presidential election in Romania, receiving 22.94% of the votes. Elena Lascu, the leader of the right-wing party 'Union for Saving Romania', came in second with 19.18% of the votes, while Marcel Ciolacu, the leader of the Social Democratic Party and Prime Minister, came in third with 19.15% of the votes.

Georgescu, a 62-year-old agronomist, has been called the 'Romanian Trump' due to his unconventional approach to politics. He has been a member of various organizations, including the UN, and has been a candidate for Prime Minister several times. Georgescu's economic program, 'Food, Water, Energy', aims to develop people's banks, production and consumer cooperatives, and enterprises where workers are owners. Lascu, a 52-year-old mayor of the city of Câmpulung Muscel, has been a journalist and has been involved in various reforms, including those related to Ukraine and Russia. Georgescu's victory has caused a shock in Romania and has led to panic among the 'system' parties, which have accused him of being 'anti-Western', 'pro-Russian', 'ultra-nationalist', and 'anti-Semitic'.

**Calin Georgescu: The Ultra-Nationalist Who Won Romania's First Round of Presidential Election**
Calin Georgescu, a 62-year-old university professor and ultranationalist, has caused a political earthquake in Romania by winning the first round of the presidential election without the support of any party and with a campaign centered on viral videos on TikTok. Georgescu, who has 200,000 followers on TikTok, has been a vocal critic of the European Union and NATO, and has expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin. He has challenged the traditional Romanian politicians and left the country, which shares a 650-kilometer border with Ukraine, with an uncertain political landscape. Georgescu's campaign has been focused on digital platforms, using viral videos, podcasts, and influencers to capture votes, particularly among young people. He has proposed reducing dependence on imports, supporting farmers, increasing domestic food and energy production, and offering tax benefits to Romanian producers. Georgescu's strategy has left analysts debating whether his surprise success is due to voter discontent with high inflation, disinformation, or even possible Russian interference, given his known support for Putin and his open criticism of NATO and the EU. Georgescu said in a press conference on election night, 'The Romanian people have awakened and refuse to be on their knees, invaded and humiliated.' He linked economic discontent to his success and, in a veiled message towards the war in Ukraine, said, 'The Romanian people have shouted 'peace' tonight.' His mystical rhetoric, in which he describes himself as a 'sent' by God, has generated shock. Cristian Tudor Popescu, a renowned Romanian journalist, said, 'On the night of November 24, 2024, the Russian invasion of Romania began.' After being eliminated in the first round, George Simion, leader of the ultraright Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), announced his support for Georgescu in the second round.

**Calin Georgescu: The Pro-Russian Candidate Who Won the First Round of the Romanian Presidential Election**
Calin Georgescu, a 62-year-old politician, has won the first round of the Romanian presidential election with 22.94% of the votes, according to the latest estimates. This unexpected result makes him the main opposition figure in Romania. Georgescu has a history of controversy, including a 2022 incident where he qualified Ion Antonescu, a principal perpetrator of the Holocaust in Romania, and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the founder of an openly antisemitic and homophobic organization, as 'heroes of the nation.' He is also critical of Romania's membership in the EU and NATO, claiming that the country has been 'neutralized economically.' During the 2024 election campaign, Georgescu used TikTok to promote his radical pro-Russian stance, which is particularly divisive given Romania's shared border with Ukraine. It remains to be seen if Georgescu and the far-right will confirm their rise to power in the second round of the election on December 8.

**Romanian Presidential Election: Calin Georgescu Surprises with Lead**
In a surprise turn of events, Calin Georgescu, a little-known politician with far-right views, has taken the lead in the first round of the Romanian presidential election with 22.91% of the vote, followed closely by Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu with 19.18% and Elena Lasconi with 19.15%. Georgescu's victory is attributed to his intense social media campaign, particularly on TikTok, which was not predicted by pre-election polls. According to commentators, Georgescu's success is a reflection of the public's dissatisfaction with the current political class and a protest against the mainstream parties. Georgescu's views are considered even more radical than those of George Simion, a far-right populist leader, and he has been criticized for his anti-NATO and anti-missile defense stance. 'Georgescu is one of the most categorical promoters of anti-Western narratives, beneficial to Russia's Vladimir Putin,' said Radio Europa Libera. The second round of the election will take place on December 8, and the parliamentary elections will be held on December 1.

**Calin Georgescu Wins First Round of Romanian Presidential Election**
Calin Georgescu, a candidate from the radical right, has won the first round of the presidential election in Romania with 22% of the vote, according to the Central Electoral Office. He was running as an independent candidate and was seen as a 'system outsider.' Georgescu's victory was a surprise, as he was not considered a front-runner in the polls. The media are shocked by the result, with many outlets publishing articles asking 'Who is Calin Georgescu?' Georgescu's campaign was highly active on social media, particularly on TikTok. Analysts and strategists had not anticipated the impact of social media on the election. Georgescu's victory is seen as a sign of discontent with the political class and a protest against the mainstream parties. He has been critical of NATO and the US, and has been accused of having pro-Russian views. Georgescu has said that he does not admire Vladimir Putin, but has been criticized for his anti-Western views. The second round of the election will take place on December 8, and the parliamentary election will be held on December 1.

**UPDATE - Romania presidential elections 2024: Huge shock in the first round as nationalist independent candidate Calin Georgescu wins first round. PM Marcel Ciolacu narrowly surpassed by reformist leader Elena Lasconi**
Independent candidate Calin Georgescu has won the first round of the Romanian presidential elections with 22.9% of the votes, a huge surprise in the country's electoral history. Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, who was the favorite according to opinion polls, is likely to be surpassed by reformist leader Elena Lasconi (USR) in the second round. With 99.93% of the votes centralized, Lasconi is currently leading by a narrow margin of about 400 votes over Ciolacu. The results indicate strong dissatisfaction with the establishment parties and leave the parliamentary elections set for next Sunday (December 1) open to more surprises. Georgescu's campaign focused on social media channels, where he gained a lot of traction, and his nationalist messages resonated with voters, who are profoundly unhappy with the governing parties - PSD and PNL. The nationalist current has reached a score of 36%, leaving the parliamentary elections open to a surprise result as well.
