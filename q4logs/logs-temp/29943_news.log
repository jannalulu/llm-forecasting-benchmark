**Is Trump Media Stock Heading Back to All-Time Highs?**
Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT) stock may see a surge in value after Donald Trump's election win, but it's a highly risky investment. The company's recent quarterly results showed a 6% decline in net sales and an operating loss of $23.7 million. The stock has been trading like a cryptocurrency and speculative buy, and its market cap of $6.6 billion is difficult to justify based on its financial performance and growth prospects. Analyst David Jagielski suggests not buying the stock, citing its uncertain future and high risk. However, the article also mentions that the company's social media platform Truth Social and streaming service Truth+ may see increased traffic and interest, which could lead to improved results for the company.

**Should You Buy Trump Media Stock Based on a Trump Victory?**
Trump Media & Technology Group's stock has surged following Donald Trump's presidential victory, but investors should consider whether the company can sustain growth without him. The company's concept, Truth Social, was created as a competitor to Twitter after Trump was banned, but Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter has invalidated this competitive advantage. With little incentive to leave X (Twitter) and repost to Truth Social, the company's managers have a difficult task to broaden the site's appeal beyond Trump. The company's financials show a significant increase in losses, and its high price-to-sales ratio and book value make it a stock to avoid. 'Unless Truth Social can draw considerably more activity unrelated to the past and future president, Trump Media stock is unlikely to drive market-beating returns.'

**Trump Media stock plummets 22% after five-week surge - UPI.com**
After a five-week surge, the stock of Truth Social's owner, Trump Media & Technology Group, plummeted 22.3% on Wednesday, resulting in a $1.3 billion loss in former President Donald Trump's net worth.

**Trump Media & Technology Group Shares Plummet 22.3% in Worst Daily Performance**
Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of social media platform Truth Social, plummeted 22.3% on Wednesday, reaching a price of $40.03. This represents the company's worst daily performance since its initial public offering, surpassing the 21.5% decline on April 1. The company has not issued a statement explaining the sudden drop, but some traders attribute it to the loss of momentum and technical factors. Matthew Tottle, CEO of Tottle Capital Management, believes that the failure to maintain momentum and reach new highs is the reason for the heavy selling seen on Wednesday. He told CNN, 'This is how these things happen, smart traders know how to make money and get out, while less intelligent traders bear the consequences.' Despite the company's market value of over $8 billion, its fundamentals remain modest. The stock appears to be prone to sharp fluctuations without official announcements from the company, indicating a lack of stability in the market.

**Trump Media Stock Soars as Election Day Nears**
Shares of Truth Social's parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), have surged 18% to $46, its highest level since June. The company, majority owned by former President Donald Trump, has become a 'meme stock' attracting investors betting on Trump's chances of defeating Vice President Kamala Harris. Despite a net loss of $16.4 million in the second quarter, some investors are looking ahead to the company's next financial results, which may include revenue of $837,000.

**What Happens To Your Investment in Trump Stock If He Loses the 2024 Election?**
Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT), the parent company of Truth Social, has been volatile since its public listing on March 26, 2024. The stock spiked 41% on its first day of trading but has since given back all gains and more. The company's financials are a concern, with $4.1 million in revenue in 2023 but a loss of $58.2 million. CEO Devin Nunes has stated that the company will continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future. Short sellers have also targeted the company, shorting about 12% of all outstanding DJT shares. Trump losing the November election may put additional pressure on the stock, making its future unpredictable. As of now, there is no Wall Street analyst coverage, and the stock will likely trade on emotion rather than fundamentals until it can show profitability.

**Trump Media & Technology Group Shares Reach New Peak**
The shares of the Trump Media & Technology Group, a social media company founded by former US President Donald Trump, have reached a peak in six weeks, according to Reuters. The company's stock has maintained a 16% increase over the past few days. Truth Social, the social network associated with the Trump Media & Technology Group, has seen a 45% increase in value over the past week, reaching $23.85. 57% of Truth Social's shares are owned by Republican candidate Donald Trump. This comes after the company faced a 10% decline following Trump's presidential debate with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris on September 10. Truth Social had also seen a 57% decline between March and August 2024, and a 33% decline the following month. 'The company has been able to recover from its previous setbacks,' said no one in the article, but it is clear that the recent surge in stock value is a positive development for the company.

**Trump Media's Stock Has Jumped From Its Recent Lows**
Shares of Truth Social's parent company, Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT), jumped 16% to around $24 on Thursday, reaching its highest level in months. The move was likely spurred by the company's announcement of a new app for watching its streaming video offering in Google's Play Store. The stock has been volatile, influenced by investor views on former President Donald Trump's political fortunes and company news. Despite the recent surge, the shares are still well off their 2024 highs near $80, but have recovered to levels last seen in August.

**Trump faces questions about whether he will dump his own media stocks as lockup date expires**
Former US President Donald Trump's 57% stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social, is set to be unlocked, allowing him to sell shares if he chooses. The company's stock price has plummeted by over US$4 billion in the past four months, from US$6.2 billion to US$1.8 billion. Trump has repeatedly claimed he has no intention of selling his shares, saying, 'No, I'm not selling. No, I love it.' However, other insiders, including co-founders Andy Litinsky and Wes Moss, are also eligible to sell their shares, raising the possibility that they could choose to exit. Trump's refusal to sell may steady investor confidence for now, but the company's future direction remains uncertain, putting Trump in a challenging position.

**Trump Media & Technology Group Stock Value Hits New Low**
The stock value of Trump Media & Technology Group, a company co-owned by Donald Trump, has fallen to its lowest level. The company, which includes the social media platform Truth Social, was created after Trump's accounts were temporarily suspended on Twitter and Facebook following the January 6, 2021 Capitol riots. According to regulatory documents, the company reported $4.1 million in revenue last year, but also $58.2 million in losses. The company's stock value has been volatile, with a 31% increase in mid-July after Trump was attacked in Butler, Pennsylvania, followed by a 10% drop after his presidential debate performance, and a 12% increase after he announced he would not sell his shares. The company's stock value has now fallen 8% in the latest decline, demonstrating the fragility of a company tied to Trump's fortunes. Trump owns approximately $115 million worth of shares in the company, valued at around $1.6 billion.

**Trump Media Stock Continues to Decline Amid Insider Sales**
Trump Media & Technology, the parent company of Truth Social, has seen its stock price continue to decline. The stock price dropped by over 3% to around $14.25 per share after spiking to nearly $18 last week. This decline is due to the expiration of lock-up agreements, which prevented insiders, including Donald Trump, and investors from selling their shares. Trump stated in an interview last week, 'I will not be selling my shares.' The sale of shares by large investors could put additional pressure on the already struggling stock price. The stock price was around $70 at the beginning of the year, particularly after the merger with a blank-check company. The expiration of lock-up agreements may also lead to increased short-selling of the stock, according to an analysis by S3 Partners. Trump Media was the worst-performing stock in the Russell 1000 index on Thursday, according to Bespoke Investment Group, despite the index as a whole increasing in value over the same period.

**Trump Media Stock Plummets to All-Time Low**
The actions of Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) plummeted to their all-time low on Friday, the first day of trading where its main shareholder, former President Donald Trump, is free to sell his stake in the company behind the Truth Social platform. TMTG's actions dropped by nearly 8% to close at $13.55 USD, valuing the company at less than $3 billion USD. Mr. Trump owns more than half of the company. Despite the volatile action, the billionaire and other insiders were unable to profit due to standard lock-up agreements that prevent major stakeholders from selling shares during a defined period after the company goes public. TMTG began trading on the stock exchange in March. According to SEC documents, Donald Trump owns approximately 115 million shares of the company, valued at around $1.6 billion USD based on the stock's price on Friday morning. It is generally not in the interest of major shareholders to try to sell large blocks of their shares, as it could risk a wider sale. Since TMTG's listing on the stock exchange, its actions have fluctuated greatly, often in response to news related to its first shareholder, the Republican presidential candidate. Last week, the company's actions surged by nearly 12% after Mr. Trump stated that he would not sell any shares when the lock-up period was lifted. The action dropped by over 10% after the debate at the beginning of the month between the Republican and Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris. In mid-July, the actions rose by over 31% on the first day of trading after the first attempt on Trump's life. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. is now worth significantly less than it was several months ago. When the company debuted on the Nasdaq in March, the actions reached a peak of $79.38 USD. The closing price on Friday represents an 83% drop from that peak. Truth Social was established when Donald Trump was banned from Twitter (now X) and Facebook following the January 6, 2021 Capitol riots. Based in Sarasota, Florida, Trump Media is losing money and struggling to generate revenue. It lost nearly $58.2 million USD last year while generating only $4.1 million USD in revenue, according to regulatory documents.

**In 'Major Moment' for Trump Media, Stocks Take a New Dip**
Shares for Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of Truth Social, fell nearly 7% to a record low of $13.73 on Friday, making the company worth less than $3 billion. This is a 75% drop from the end of March when shares hit a high of nearly $80. According to Baylor University finance professor Michael Stegemoller, 'He's smarter than that' for Trump not to sell his shares, as it would hurt the share price. Trump currently holds around $1.6 billion in TMTG, down from a high of $6.2 billion just a few months ago. 'No, I'm not selling,' Trump said last week, 'No, I love it.'

Trump said, 'I'm not going to sell my shares,' but the expiration of lock-up agreements that prohibited them from selling could facilitate increased short selling.

**Trump Media Stock Continues Sharp Plunge**
Donald Trump's Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (DJT) stock has been plummeting since July, dropping from a high of $79.38 to below $14 a share on Friday morning. The decline comes as a lock-up period ends, allowing Trump to sell shares for the first time. Trump formed the company in 2021 after being voted out of the White House and launched the Truth Social platform after being banned on X (then Twitter) and other social media outlets. Despite a strong launch, the company's stock prices have been volatile, and it has yet to turn a profit. Trump owns approximately 57% of the company and has tried to calm investors by saying he's not leaving, stating, 'People think that I'm leaving. That's why they're down, because it's different if I leave. But I'm not leaving.' However, if Trump decides to unload stock, investors will be notified due to SEC regulations requiring shareholders with more than a 10% stake to disclose any sales of their shares.

**Truth Social Wipeout: The $4 Billion Blow to the Donald Trump Media Empire**
Donald Trump's social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), is facing a significant decline in its market value, wiping out a substantial portion of Trump's personal wealth. Shares of the company, which owns Truth Social, have fallen by nearly 72% since reaching a peak in March, raising concerns about the enterprise's long-term viability. Analysts and experts have expressed concerns about the financial fundamentals of TMTG, citing its struggle to generate substantial revenue and its minor presence in the competitive social media landscape. As Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, said, 'If this wasn't Trump, this thing would be trading at $1.' The company's future hinges largely on Trump's success in the election, and experts warn that separating politics from profits is essential. Despite its stock market struggles, TMTG still holds over $300 million in cash and equivalents, giving it financial power to pursue acquisitions and support its operations. However, the lock-up period preventing Trump and other insiders from selling shares is set to expire on September 20, 2024, which could potentially flood the market and drive prices even lower.

**Trump Media stock hits new low — just as Trump, others are able to sell shares**
Former President Donald Trump and other insiders at Trump Media & Technology Group, the owner of Truth Social, can now sell their shares in the company after a lock-up period expired. This comes as the company's stock, trading under the ticker DJT, hit a new low, falling 92 cents or 5.9% to $14.70. The lock-up period, which was designed to prevent executives from immediately selling shares and causing a stock to tumble, had been in place since the company's public offering in March. According to Yahoo, the company's stock had an initial surge after the offering, providing a valuation of over $9.4 billion, but has since had a 'bumpy reception' from Wall Street.

**Truth Social's Stock Keeps Sliding This Week. Here's Why**
Shares of Truth Social's parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), have been declining since its public listing in March, falling from a high of $70 to around $15. The stock's latest decline is attributed to the expected end of a lock-up period, which has prevented former President Trump and other insiders from selling their shares. Trump, who owns nearly 60% of the company's outstanding stock, has expressed his support for the stock, stating 'It is my intention to own this stock for a long period of time' and 'I don't want to sell my shares. I'm not going to sell my shares.' Despite this, DJT stock has fallen nearly 6% this week, finishing Thursday at $15.

Trump personally owns nearly 57% of the company's outstanding shares, worth an estimated $1.7 billion. Trump said, 'No, I'm not selling,' but the gains were short-lived, and the share price has continued to decline.

**As Its Stock Nosedives, Truth Social Sounds Like an Absolute Wreck Behind the Scenes**
Truth Social, owned by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), is facing financial struggles despite its multibillion-dollar valuation. The company's revenues are declining, profits are non-existent, and it is facing multiple lawsuits. With the six-month lockup period expiring, former president Donald Trump is likely to sell his 114.5 million shares of TMTG, which could trigger a fire sale and further tank the company's already low share value. University of Florida business professor Jay Ritter said, 'The only bull case for the stock that I can think of is the greater fool theory of investing.' This theory suggests that investors can make money by buying an overvalued stock if they can find an even greater fool who is willing to buy it at an even higher price.
