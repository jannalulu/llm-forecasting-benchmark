**10 Movies Releasing In 2025 That Are Major Box Office Risks**
The 2025 movie release schedule is full of box office risks, with several high-budget films that may struggle to turn a profit. Some of the most notable risks include the $400 million Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning, the $269.4 million Snow White remake, and the $150 million Mickey 17. Other films, such as Wicked Part Two and Sinners, may also face challenges at the box office. However, some films, like Jurassic World Rebirth and Saw XI, are expected to be hits. The success of these films will depend on various factors, including their marketing, production quality, and audience reception. 'It's a tough time for the box office,' said a Hollywood insider. 'Even the biggest franchises are struggling to make a profit.'

**'Red One' made $34 million on a $250 million budget in its first weekend. That sounds bad  --  but Amazon MGM never planned to make its profit in theaters.**
Amazon MGM's 'Red One' made $34 million in its opening weekend in North America, which may seem disappointing given its $350 million budget. However, media experts say the film's theatrical release was never intended to turn a profit, but rather to generate buzz before its release on Amazon Prime Video. The film has received positive word of mouth, with an A- CinemaScore and 90% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Amazon hopes the positive reception will attract new subscribers and viewers who will watch ads, recouping the investment. As one expert noted, 'No doubt if this bet does not pay off, there could be reluctance in future to repeat, as reported, paying a star like Johnson $50 million for his involvement.'

**Spirit Airlines Files For Bankruptcy, Aims To Exit Chapter 11 In Early 2025**
Spirit Airlines, the largest ultra-low-cost carrier in North America, has filed for bankruptcy protection after years of losses and several failed mergers. Despite this, the airline assures customers that it will be business as usual. Spirit expects to emerge from a streamlined chapter 11 process in the first quarter of 2025. CEO Ted Christie said, 'The most important thing to know is that you can continue to book and fly now and in the future.' The airline has struggled with rising costs, a Pratt & Whitney engine recall, and a limited market, leading to a 92% drop in its stock price over the past year. Spirit's financial woes have grown, and it is expected to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in the near term.

**German Vehicle Dealer Files for Bankruptcy Amid Decline in Demand**
A major German vehicle dealer, 'Auto und Freizeit Nord', has filed for bankruptcy. The company, which specializes in motorhomes and caravans, is offering significant discounts on its remaining stock, with prices reduced by up to €20,000 on some models. The exact cause of the bankruptcy is unknown, but it is thought to be linked to a decline in demand following the COVID-19 pandemic, which had led to a surge in sales. The company's managing director has not commented on the situation, but the news has left around 60 employees uncertain about their jobs. 'Auto und Freizeit Nord' has been in business since 1997 and had recently invested in a new headquarters in 2022.

**AMC is poised to ride the box office rebound, as long as its debt doesn't get in the way**
AMC, the world's largest movie theater chain, is poised to benefit from the domestic box office rebound, but its heavy debt load may hinder its ability to capitalize on the trend. Despite having a larger footprint than its rivals, AMC operates with over $4 billion in long-term debt, which continues to weigh on its bottom line. Analyst Eric Wold noted that while the company has taken steps to reduce its debt, it still has a lot of debt and is paying high interest rates. In the third quarter, AMC's revenue outpaced its spending, but interest payments pushed the company to a nearly $21 million loss. Wold predicts that AMC will not be consistently profitable for several years. However, the company is taking steps to improve its revenue and coax lapsed moviegoers back into its theaters, with improved movie slates prepared for 2025 and 2026.

**Spirit Airlines stock plunges 58% as company reportedly preps bankruptcy filing**
Spirit Airlines' stock plummeted 58% on Wednesday as the company explores a deal with creditors to restructure its debt amid a reported threat of bankruptcy after merger talks with Frontier collapsed. According to a Wall Street Journal report, Spirit is preparing to file for bankruptcy protection within weeks. Spirit has been in 'constructive discussions' with holders of its senior secure notes due in 2025, but if an agreement is not reached, the carrier will consider all alternatives. Spirit stock has fallen over 90% this year, and analysts have grown increasingly bearish on the airline, with eight Sell recommendations on the stock. TD Cowen analyst Tom Fitzgerald wrote, '[Tuesday's] news also creates the risk of customers booking away from the airline resulting in even greater pressure on liquidity.' In the event of a restructuring, Spirit is expected to sell off encumbered assets to pay off debt and reject leases on the rest of the fleet.

**DTEK Vostokenergo Declared Bankrupt**
The Economic Court of the Donetsk region has declared 'DTEK Vostokenergo', a company owned by Rinat Akhmetov, bankrupt. The company was involved in the production and sale of electricity and heat on three power plants in eastern Ukraine, which are now either inaccessible or not operating. The main assets of 'DTEK Vostokenergo' included the Zuevskaya TES, which the company lost control of in 2017 due to military actions in occupied territories, the Luhansk TES in Svatove, where production stopped in February 2022 due to occupation, and the Kurchatovskaya TES, which stopped working in 2023. The bankruptcy procedure began in February 2024, initiated by 'DTEK Dneproenergo' due to a debt of over 24.35 million hryvnia. As reported earlier, DTEK has concentrated around 70% of thermal generation, according to the conclusions of the AMCU. The company 'DTEK Vostokenergo' has been accused of monopolistic practices, along with 'DTEK Dneproenergo' and 'DTEK Zapadenergo'. 'DTEK' and 'Energoatom' have also been accused of creating a new scheme for earning money during the war, as reported by ZN.UA. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students,' said no one in this article, but it is a testament to the financial struggles of 'DTEK Vostokenergo'.

**DTKE Sichenergo Declared Bankrupt by Donetsk Oblast Court**
The Economic Court of Donetsk Oblast has declared 'DTKE Sichenergo', an energy company owned by Rinat Akhmetov, bankrupt. The company was responsible for producing and selling electricity and heat in eastern Ukraine, but its main assets, including the Zuevskaya TES, Luhansk TES, and Kuryakhivskaya TES, have been either occupied or shut down due to the war. The bankruptcy procedure began in February 2024, initiated by DTKE Dniproenergo, which claimed a debt of over 24.35 million hryvnia. This move comes as part of a larger investigation into DTKE's dominance in the Ukrainian energy market, with the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine (AMCU) finding signs of monopolization in several DTKE companies. 'DTKE has concentrated around 70% of thermal generation', according to the AMCU. As reported by ZN.UA, DTKE and Energoatom have also created a new scheme for earning profits during the war, as detailed in an article by Sergei Holovnev, 'How Akhmetov earned a billion hryvnia from Energoatom in March'.

**American Fast-Food Chain Announces Bankruptcy Amid Financial Struggles**
A well-known American fast-food chain has announced its bankruptcy, citing financial difficulties caused by the economic struggles of US consumers. The chain, which has 39 locations, has been struggling since the COVID-19 pandemic, when rising housing costs and inflation prevented customers from dining out for several months. According to the company's statement, the decision to file for bankruptcy was made after evaluating the company's assets, which are valued between $100 million and $500 million, and its liabilities, which are also between $100 million and $500 million. In January, the chain suddenly closed dozens of locations across the US, and has continued to do so quietly, with around 50 locations closing last week, leaving only 163 out of 270 locations in the US. The chain, which started in Manhattan in 1965 as a place for singles to meet, was one of the first major chains to popularize the concept of 'happy hour', and offers various types of chicken wings, potato skins, and burgers.

**STJ Clarifies Application of New Bankruptcy Law to Old Cases**
The Brazilian Supreme Court (STJ) has clarified the application of the new bankruptcy law (Lei 14.112/2020) to cases of bankruptcy declared before its entry into force. The law introduced a three-year deadline for late creditors to file their claims, but there was uncertainty about how this deadline would apply to bankruptcies declared before the law's implementation. The STJ recently ruled that the new law should be applied to avoid immediately eliminating the right of creditors to file previously acquired debts. As a result, the starting point for the three-year deadline is now January 23, 2021, allowing creditors to file claims that were previously pending. This decision has significant implications for the administration of old bankruptcies, providing a window for creditors with acquired rights under the previous regime to exercise their rights. The STJ's position avoids the immediate extinguishment of acquired rights under the previous legislation. The benefits of this decision include the protection of acquired rights, legal certainty, and the increase in the efficiency of the bankruptcy process.

**US Retail Icon Files for Bankruptcy and Closes 70 Stores Amid Pandemic-Driven Changes**
A legendary US company has filed for bankruptcy and will close at least 70 stores due to the significant changes in consumer behavior brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company, a retail icon in the US market, has been forced to restructure its business model and find new ways to operate in a rapidly evolving market.

'We are committed to adapting to the new market conditions and finding a balance between physical and digital sales to remain competitive.' The company's bankruptcy has generated mixed reactions from consumers and market analysts, with some lamenting the closure of a beloved brand and others seeing it as a necessary step for companies to survive in a changing environment.

**Texas Judge Will Decide Whether Talcum Powder Lawsuit Bankruptcy Filing Can Move Forward After Hearing in January 2025**
A federal judge in Texas will decide in January 2025 whether Johnson & Johnson's latest attempt to use the bankruptcy system to resolve 62,000 talcum powder cancer lawsuits can move forward. The company has repeatedly tried to use the 'Texas Two-Step' tactic, which involves creating a new subsidiary and transferring liabilities to it, to artificially cap financial damage. This has been criticized by legal experts, judges, and the Justice Department as an abuse of the bankruptcy system. Johnson & Johnson has filed for bankruptcy in Texas, despite being headquartered in New Jersey, and claims it has received approval from over 75% of claimants, a claim disputed by plaintiffs' attorneys.

**Sevastopol Contractor 'Smartstroy' Files for Bankruptcy, Leaving One Active Contract**
The Moscow-based company 'Smartstroy' has lost all its active state contracts in Sevastopol, except for one, worth almost 2 billion rubles, to develop and restore the Dramatic Theatre named after Lunacharsky. The company was supposed to design and build a new wing of the 4th city hospital, but the project's cost increased eightfold and was not approved by the city's customers. As a result, the company withdrew from the project, and the contract was officially terminated in 2023. The company also had four other medical contracts worth around 400 million rubles, but they were all terminated on the same day due to the company's failure to fulfill its obligations. The company has filed for bankruptcy and several lawsuits have been filed against it, seeking to recover unpaid advances and fines. The remaining contract is for the development and restoration of the Dramatic Theatre, which is expected to be completed by December 2025. However, the company's bankruptcy proceedings may pose a threat to the contract's execution. 'Smartstroy' has been accused of violating the terms of the contract and has been fined 5.5 million rubles. The company's representatives have acknowledged that the organization is insolvent and have filed for bankruptcy. The court has accepted the case and a hearing is scheduled for November. It is worth noting that the contract was signed by the former head of the Sevastopol Directorate of Capital Construction, Vasily Babkin, who was recently sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for exceeding his authority. The current general director of 'Smartstroy' has the same name and has been in office since last year.

**German Company Lilium Files for Bankruptcy**
German company 'Lilium' announced its intention to file for bankruptcy on Friday. The company, a leader in electric aircraft manufacturing, informed the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it no longer has the necessary financial resources to continue operations. As a result, its board of directors will submit a request for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which will allow the company to restructure its debt and potentially attract new investors. However, it is unclear whether the court will approve the request. Lilium has been developing an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and plans to conduct its first manned flight in the spring of 2025, with the first deliveries to customers expected in 2026. According to Lilium, 'the company is taking this step to ensure the long-term viability of its business and to create a sustainable future for its employees, customers, and stakeholders.'

Investors have poured in €5.1 billion into the Nasdaq-listed company, but obtaining licenses and developing production has required significant additional costs. Lilium spent around €200 million in the first half of 2024 alone. The Berlin government coalition refused a request for a €50 million government loan guarantee. Although the Social Democratic Party and the Liberal Party supported the request, the Green Party rejected it. Bavaria has already pledged a €50 million loan guarantee, but only if the federal government also contributes to the company in the same way.

**Lilium Files for Bankruptcy Due to Failed Government Loan Guarantee**
Lilium, a German developer of electric flight taxis, has announced that it will file for bankruptcy due to the failure of a 50 million euro government loan guarantee. The company had been seeking financial support from the German state, but the proposal was blocked by the Greens in the coalition government. SPD's Dennis Rohde said, 'Germany cannot afford to lose industrial jobs of the future. We would have liked to support this climate-neutral technology with state funding, but unfortunately, there was no majority in the current coalition.' Lilium has developed an all-electric, vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) flight taxi, with plans for a manned first flight in early 2025 and commercial delivery of the first aircraft in 2026.

**Another giant auto parts brand files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy**
American Tire Distributors, a leading tire and wheel replacement company, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection seeking a sale of its assets, burdened with over $1.9 billion in funded debt. The company, which operates 15 distribution centers and serves over 80,000 retail customers in North America, listed $1 billion to $10 billion in assets and liabilities in its petition. The debtor and 12 affiliates are seeking to obtain $1.45 billion in debtor-in-possession financing from its prepetition lenders to fund operations during the bankruptcy case. According to the company's chief restructuring officer, Ronald J. Bienias, the financial distress was caused by soaring inflation after the Covid-19 pandemic and a decline in demand for auto products beginning in 2022. The company had previously marketed itself for sale in May 2024, but the nonbinding letter of intent was terminated on October 9, 2024.

Despite the decline of movie theaters in Quebec, Cineplex is investing in new and improved cinemas. The company is opening five new screens at the Royalmount complex, which will feature large, comfortable seats and a variety of amenities. However, the number of movie theaters in Quebec has been declining, with three cinemas and 35 screens closing between 2019 and 2023. According to Eric Bouchard, coprésident of the Association des propriétaires de cinémas du Québec, the industry has been affected by the pandemic, the rise of streaming services, and the decline of movie attendance. However, the industry is optimistic about the future, with many owners investing in renovations and new technologies. Armand Lafond, president of Axia Films, expresses concern about the lack of independent movie theaters, citing the closure of the Excentris cinema in 2015. The future of the Guzzo cinema chain is also uncertain, with the company facing financial difficulties and a possible bankruptcy. Raffaele Papalia, president of the Association des cinémas du Canada, wishes Guzzo well and believes that the industry will recover in 2025 with the release of new movies.

**Major Cinema Chains Unveil $2.2 Billion Transformation Strategy**
A group of eight major cinema chains, including AMC Entertainment and Regal Cinemas, has announced a massive $2.2 billion transformation strategy, which will affect around 21,000 screens, approximately 70% of the North American box office. This makeover covers every aspect of the cinematic experience, from visual ads to snacks and luxury seats. This three-year investment was launched during a recent box office recovery, after two Hollywood strikes and the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to closures and reduced film releases. Traditional cinemas are reacting to luxury rivals offering premium viewing experiences, such as IPIC Theaters and Alamo Drafthouse, which was recently acquired by Sony Pictures Entertainment. According to the National Association of Theaters (NATO), the fight for audience spending dollars is more intense than ever. This extensive makeover is seen as a way to showcase these improvements to the public firsthand. The updates include modernizing and elevating cinemas of all sizes, adopting advanced projection systems, superior audio technologies, improved seating, and updated concessions. Additional recreational structures, such as game rooms and bowling alleys, may also be introduced. The makeover includes fresher air conditioning, new signage, and refinished floors. The individual amounts spent by the cinema chains have not been disclosed. The money comes from growing profits and fresh investments, according to the industry association. In the summer of 2021, Regal promised $250 million for the makeover of its 400 cinemas after its parent company's bankruptcy. This $2.2 billion commitment demonstrates 'unwavering optimism' in the future of cinemas, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior analyst at Comscore. 'Throughout its history, the cinema business has faced its share of fluctuations like any other, but the intention behind the big-screen experience has remained and continues to be an integral part of global entertainment culture,' Dergarabedian commented. The renewed interest in cinemas benefits various activities, including advanced projection system providers and premium seating suppliers. This massive transformation strategy aims to attract more customers and retain their loyalty by offering a superior cinematic experience.
