**What a storm from California means about snow in the Northeast on Thanksgiving**
A storm emerging from the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California is expected to bring stormy conditions to the Northeast on Thanksgiving, potentially impacting millions of travelers. According to AccuWeather, the storm could dump 'multiple' feet of snow in the Midwest and Northeast, with the rain-snow line setting up in the Midwest and Northeast. Bernie Rayno, AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist, said, 'There are many variables we are still analyzing with this storm with track and intensity being the keys to where the rain and snow line will set up and the amount of snow that will fall in the Midwest and Northeast.' Central New England could see 3 inches of snow in areas of higher elevation, while other parts of the Northeast may see fragmented snowfall. New York City is expected to see 'heavy downpours can reduce visibility and cause ponding on streets and highways,' with temperatures dropping to 48 degrees. Southern New England's higher elevation areas are also expected to see snow mix in with rain, with the possibility of accumulating snow at elevations above 1,000 feet. In Maine, National Weather Service forecasters expect stormy conditions to move south on Thanksgiving, with a 50 to 70% chance of snowfall in the mountains accumulating 6 inches or more.

**After being pummeled by bomb cyclone, California to see drier December**
After being hit by a bomb cyclone, California is expected to see a drier December. The National Weather Service predicts below-average precipitation for the state over the next two weeks, with the northern Bay Area and North Coast expected to see the largest drop-off from normal rainfall. Meteorologist Rick Canepa said that a large high-pressure system is moving toward Northern California, disrupting the jet stream and creating drier air. While it's normal for there to be breaks in the rain, Canepa noted that the jet stream will eventually revisit the West Coast, bringing storm activity again. 'You can't have it constantly raining,' he said. 'There has to be high-pressure systems and downward motion in the atmosphere to compensate for the upward motion elsewhere.'

**Winter 2024: Countries to be Covered by Snow and Reach Freezing Temperatures**
The National Center for Atmospheric Prediction (CPC) expects a 60% chance of a phenomenon called 'nina' to occur in the United States from December 2024 to February 2025, which can cause significant temperature fluctuations and precipitation in the upper Mississippi River Valley. The CPC also predicts that the phenomenon of 'nina' will continue until March 2025, making it more likely for the world to experience colder temperatures than usual. The CPC notes that the shift from the 'nino' phenomenon to the 'nina' phenomenon will bring changes to the global climate, with some regions experiencing more variability than others. In the United States, 17 states have been issued winter weather warnings, with parts of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, and South Dakota expected to experience cold temperatures. Heavy snowfall is expected in the Oregon Cascades, with up to 2 feet of snow, and 15-18 inches of snow in the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming and the Colorado Mountains. Temperatures are expected to drop below freezing in areas affected by freeze warnings, with temperatures reaching as low as 21°F in parts of New Mexico and 22-23°F in parts of Colorado.

**California: Authorities Issue Recommendations for the Upcoming Harsh Winter**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its winter 2024-2025 forecast for California, predicting that December to February will be the coldest months in the region. According to NOAA, the decrease in temperatures will be more pronounced due to the La Niña phenomenon, which will influence California's climate. Much of California is expected to experience below-average seasonal total precipitation, and NOAA meteorologists warn that drought conditions could persist and worsen in the central and southern plains of the United States, as stated by NOAA. 'This winter is expected to be one of the coolest on record,' said NOAA. However, the article does not specify who said this, so I have not included a quote in the summary.

**First cold spell of season brings temperatures in 30s and 40s to Bay Area**

Forecaster Brayden Murdock said, 'Even though we are going to see a good amount of sunshine today, a lot of folks will probably notice that temperatures are quite a bit colder.' Afternoon highs on Monday were in the 60s, but temperatures are expected to drop further on Tuesday, with the interior North Bay and eastern parts of Santa Clara and Alameda counties potentially seeing temperatures in the 30s. The cold weather is expected to continue through Wednesday, with a chance of rain returning on Thursday and Friday. Murdock noted that the weather has fallen into a pattern of a few wet days followed by a few dry days, typical for this time of year.

**Rain and 10-degree temperature drop enter SF Bay Area forecast**
A low-pressure system is moving into the San Francisco Bay Area, bringing a mass of cool air and a chance of light rain. According to Dylan Flynn, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Bay Area office, 'We have high pressure over the Great Basin and low pressure in the eastern Pacific, and that's creating some down-gradient flow.' This has heightened the wildfire risk, but is expected to shift to onshore winds midday, lowering the fire risk. The fog that has been absent this week is expected to return Friday night into Saturday morning, and the Bay Area will likely see one last day of warmth before the cool-down begins. Next week is predicted to be about 10 degrees cooler than this week, with widespread 60s across the region. Flynn said, 'Monday, we're going to be chilly, especially in the morning. It'll be cooler, especially in the first half of the week.' The North Bay has the highest chance of seeing rain, with up to a quarter-inch expected.
