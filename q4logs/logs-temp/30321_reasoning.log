To forecast whether South Carolina will have 300,000 or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024, let's analyze the information:

1. **Base Rates and Historical Trends:** Droughts in South Carolina have been a recurring issue, but the intensity and duration can vary significantly. Historically, drought conditions in this region can last several months, especially under the influence of climatic patterns like La Niña.

2. **Current Situation:** Recent reports indicate a decrease in areas under drought from 100% to 72% in the state, with moderate drought in certain counties. However, there is an ongoing concern about insufficient rainfall, exacerbated by La Niña patterns, predicting below-normal precipitation for South Carolina in the winter months.

3. **Causal Forces:** The La Niña weather pattern is expected to persist, which historically correlates with drier than usual conditions in the Carolinas. Despite occasional improvements in drought conditions due to short periods of rain, sustained and significant precipitation is necessary to alleviate drought conditions.

4. **Recent Improvements and Prognosis:** There has been some rain and a slight drop in drought-affected areas recently. Yet, forecasts suggest continued below-normal rainfall, potentially maintaining or worsening drought conditions. Despite temporary improvements, the long-term outlook remains uncertain due to the persistent La Niña effect.

5. **Population in Drought:** With 72% of the state under drought, it's reasonable to estimate that the number of residents affected remains significant. South Carolina's current population trends (rapid growth) and redistribution due to housing pressures make it likely that a substantial number of residents could be impacted.

6. **Balancing Under- and Overreaction:** While recent rains have slightly improved conditions, the overall climatic outlook is less promising. However, weather predictions can be uncertain, and any unexpected changes could shift conditions favorably.

Considering the outlined factors and the current situation in South Carolina, I will weigh these against historical patterns and the potential persistence of La Niña conditions through the end of the year.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Recent drought trends show worsening conditions:
- As of Nov 14, 2024, 72% of SC was in drought conditions
- Just a week prior, 100% of state was in drought
- Moderate drought conditions affect several counties

2. Climate/Weather Forecasts:
- La Niña conditions expected for winter 2024/25
- Past La Niña winters brought 25% below normal rainfall
- Forecast calls for dry, cold weather in coming days
- No significant rainfall expected in immediate future

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Recent Improvement Trends:
- Drought conditions showed some improvement (from 100% to 72%)
- Recent rainfall has helped somewhat
- State has experience managing drought conditions

2. Seasonal Factors:
- Winter typically brings more precipitation opportunities
- Above-normal precipitation predicted for Southeast region
- Cold snaps forecast could bring precipitation

Breaking Down The Problem:
1. Current Status: Already significant drought coverage but improving
2. Time Frame: About 40 days until resolution
3. Population Threshold: 300,000 residents (relatively low given SC population)
4. Historical Context: Area prone to drought cycles

Critical Considerations:
- Short timeframe limits dramatic changes
- Recent improvement trend is significant
- But La Niña influence suggests continued dryness
- Winter patterns could either help or exacerbate
- Population threshold is achievable even with modest drought conditions

Given the confluence of factors - recent improvement but underlying dry conditions, La Niña influence, and relatively low population threshold - there's a moderate to high probability of reaching 300,000 residents in drought areas by year-end.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 75.80%, with 70.50% being the most likely. Probability: 70.50%.

For the forecasting of whether South Carolina will have 300,000 or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024, let's begin with the analysis of the current situation and the factors that could influence the outcome.

**Background Analysis:**
1. **Current Drought Status:** South Carolina is experiencing drought conditions, with varying severity across the state. Recent reports show that approximately 72% of the state is under drought conditions, although improvement has been noted recently. The drought monitor information is frequently updated, and the number of people affected aligns with these changes in drought conditions.

2. **Weather Forecasts and Patterns:** La Niña conditions are mentioned as influencing the climate in South Carolina, typically leading to drier conditions. This factor, historical trends, and the fact that La Niña has recently been prevalent may suggest continued drought conditions. However, the forecasts also indicate above-average precipitation in the southeast, tempered by periodic colder phases, which might buffer against prolonged dry conditions.

3. **Population Data and Trends:** The state has experienced significant population growth, which implies that more people may live in areas affected by drought. Thus, the absolute number of residents in drought-stricken areas might increase simply due to higher population densities in those zones.

4. **Historical Drought Data:** Review of historical data provides a baseline. We derive an initial estimate based on how often similar levels of drought affected more than 300,000 residents. It's essential to anchor the forecast in these base rates and adjust accordingly as per the latest evidence.

**Adjustment of Initial Estimate:**
- **Environmental and Climate Data:** Given the La Niña conditions and historical precedents, the situation may trend towards persisting or worsening drought, though recent reports indicate some improvement.
- **Rainfall Expectations:** Short-term forecasts speak of certain improvements, but not enough to rapidly alleviate long-term drought conditions.

**Resolution Likelihood:**
- Consider recent improvements in drought conditions and forecasted precipitation. If drought continues to improve, fewer residents may be affected. However, persistent dry conditions, exacerbated by La Niña, would lead to more than 300,000 being affected.

Combining these elements, while maintaining an awareness of potential changes, allows us to strike the right balance by not overreacting to temporary reports but recognizing sustained trends.

**Final Prediction:**
My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Current Situation:
- As of November 14, 2024, 72% of South Carolina is experiencing drought conditions, down from 100% the previous week
- This shows conditions are improving, though gradually
- Current rainfall has helped but more is needed

2. Weather Patterns & Forecasts:
- La Niña conditions are expected for winter 2024/25
- Southeast region predicted to have above-normal precipitation
- However, previous La Niña winters brought 25% below-normal rainfall in coastal areas

3. Historical Context:
- Drought conditions have been fluctuating throughout 2024
- In October, conditions worsened with 99% "Abnormally Dry"
- By November, improvement was seen but still significant drought presence

4. Key Factors to Consider:
- Only about 6 weeks until resolution date
- Winter typically brings more precipitation
- Above-normal precipitation predicted for winter
- But La Niña could reduce rainfall effectiveness

5. Population Analysis:
- South Carolina has grown by 250,000+ since 2020
- Current drought affects large portions of state
- Population distribution matters for drought impact

6. Trend Analysis:
- Recent trend shows improvement
- But drought conditions can change rapidly
- Winter forecast suggests some relief likely

The question specifically asks about 300,000 residents. Given:
- Improving conditions
- Winter precipitation outlook
- But La Niña influence
- Recent drought improvement trends
- Population distribution

The most likely scenario suggests drought conditions will continue to improve but not completely resolve by December 31, 2024. However, the 300,000 threshold is relatively low given the state's population, and recent improvements suggest this number is likely to be undershot.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 45.50%, with 35.50% being the most likely. Probability: 35.50%

To forecast whether South Carolina will have 300,000 or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024, I'll follow a structured approach:

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates:**
   - Historically, drought conditions in South Carolina have varied, with fluctuations in severity. La Niña typically correlates with drier conditions in the Southeast United States, including South Carolina. The articles indicate that La Niña impacts are expected this winter, which could maintain or worsen existing drought conditions.

2. **Breaking Down the Problem:**
   - **Drought Status as of Nov 2024:** Reports indicate that South Carolina has been experiencing drought conditions, with a recent decrease from 100% to 72% of the state under drought. The number of residents affected corresponds proportionally to the area and severity of the drought.
   - **Future Weather Prediction:** Winter 2024/25 predictions show La Niña is likely, with expected below-normal rainfall in the Carolinas.
   - **Population Growth and Migration:** The influx of retirees could increase the number of people in drought-affected areas.

3. **Inside vs. Outside View:**
   - **Inside View:** Current drought conditions and expected La Niña impact suggest a continuation or worsening of the situation.
   - **Outside View:** Historical data on La Niña-induced droughts in South Carolina should be considered for baseline probability estimates.

4. **Evidence Evaluation:**
   - The increasing impact of moderate drought in specific counties and continued La Niña predictions support the idea of persistent drought conditions.
   - However, there has been some relief recently, with rain reducing the affected areas marginally.

5. **Clashing Causal Forces:**
   - **For Drought Persistence:** La Niña conditions, recent drought trends in the Carolinas, and expected below-normal rainfall align with continued drought conditions.
   - **Against Drought Persistence:** Recent improvements and expected rainfall in the Southeast could potentially offset the drought to an extent.

6. **Trend Extrapolation:**
   - With the anticipated continuation of La Niña and current drought conditions, a linear extrapolation suggests no immediate significant relief.

7. **Degrees of Doubt:**
   - While La Niña strongly suggests ongoing drought, variability in weather patterns could still influence final outcomes. Historical cases have shown unpredictability in weather forecasts.

8. **Confidence Calibration:**
   - Considering prevailing conditions and forecasts, the probability leaning towards drought conditions affecting a large population remains high but not absolute.

9. **Past Errors:**
   - Historica predictions have sometimes overestimated the persistence of droughts due to sudden changes in weather patterns. Maintaining a buffer for unexpected rainfall is prudent.

Based on the analysis above, the drought situation in South Carolina, driven by La Niña and current conditions, suggests a reasonable probability of having 300,000 or more residents in drought by December 31, 2024. This needs to be balanced with potential unexpected rainfall improvements.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

3. **Inside vs. Outside View:**
   - **Inside View:** Current drought conditions and expected La Niña impact suggest a continuation or worsening of the situation.
   - **Outside View:** Historical data on La Niña-induced droughts in South Carolina should be considered for baseline probability estimates.

4. **Evidence Evaluation:**
   - The increasing impact of moderate drought in specific counties and continued La Niña predictions support the idea of persistent drought conditions.
   - However, there has been some relief recently, with rain reducing the affected areas marginally.

5. **Clashing Causal Forces:**
   - **For Drought Persistence:** La Niña conditions, recent drought trends in the Carolinas, and expected below-normal rainfall align with continued drought conditions.
   - **Against Drought Persistence:** Recent improvements and expected rainfall in the Southeast could potentially offset the drought to an extent.

6. **Trend Extrapolation:**
   - With the anticipated continuation of La Niña and current drought conditions, a linear extrapolation suggests no immediate significant relief.

7. **Degrees of Doubt:**
   - While La Niña strongly suggests ongoing drought, variability in weather patterns could still influence final outcomes. Historical cases have shown unpredictability in weather forecasts.

8. **Confidence Calibration:**
   - Considering prevailing conditions and forecasts, the probability leaning towards drought conditions affecting a large population remains high but not absolute.

9. **Past Errors:**
   - Historica predictions have sometimes overestimated the persistence of droughts due to sudden changes in weather patterns. Maintaining a buffer for unexpected rainfall is prudent.

Based on the analysis above, the drought situation in South Carolina, driven by La Niña and current conditions, suggests a reasonable probability of having 300,000 or more residents in drought by December 31, 2024. This needs to be balanced with potential unexpected rainfall improvements.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To forecast whether South Carolina will have 300,000 or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024, I'll follow a structured approach:

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates:**
   - Historically, drought conditions in South Carolina have varied, with fluctuations in severity. La Niña typically correlates with drier conditions in the Southeast United States, including South Carolina. The articles indicate that La Niña impacts are expected this winter, which could maintain or worsen existing drought conditions.

2. **Breaking Down the Problem:**
   - **Drought Status as of Nov 2024:** Reports indicate that South Carolina has been experiencing drought conditions, with a recent decrease from 100% to 72% of the state under drought. The number of residents affected corresponds proportionally to the area and severity of the drought.
   - **Future Weather Prediction:** Winter 2024/25 predictions show La Niña is likely, with expected below-normal rainfall in the Carolinas.
   - **Population Growth and Migration:** The influx of retirees could increase the number of people in drought-affected areas.

Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Current Situation (as of November 2024):
- 72% of South Carolina is experiencing drought conditions (down from 100% recently)
- Moderate drought still affects several counties
- The latest data shows improvement but still significant drought coverage

2. Relevant Trends:
- La Niña conditions are expected to develop, typically bringing:
  * Below-normal rainfall across coastal Carolinas
  * About 25% below normal rainfall historically
- Current forecasts predict a "calmer, gentler" winter but with above-normal precipitation for Southeast

3. Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
- Historical precedent of droughts persisting through winter
- La Niña pattern typically reduces rainfall
- Current significant drought coverage
- No significant rainfall expected in short term

4. Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
- Recent improvements in drought conditions
- Above-normal precipitation predicted for Southeast
- Winter typically brings more consistent precipitation
- Current trend is showing slow improvement

5. Population Considerations:
- South Carolina's population is growing (250,000+ since 2020)
- Population shifts could affect number of residents in drought areas
- Coastal areas (where some drought exists) are heavily populated

6. Timeline Analysis:
- We need to forecast about 40 days ahead
- Winter patterns typically establish by late December
- Recent trend is improvement but could reverse

Given:
- The recent improvement from 100% to 72% coverage
- The competing factors of La Niña (negative) vs winter precipitation (positive)
- The population distribution in current drought areas
- The threshold of 300,000 residents (relatively low given SC's population)
- The historical persistence of drought conditions

My Prediction: Between 55.20% and 75.80%, with 65.50% being the most likely. Probability: 65.50%

To forecast whether South Carolina will have 300,000 or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024, I begin by establishing the reference class and base rate for drought occurrences. Historical data regarding South Carolina's drought conditions can be insightful, though variability in climate and weather conditions can complicate prediction.

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates**: South Carolina tends to experience cycles of drought. The present data shows drought conditions have fluctuated, with a significant portion of the state under drought as recently as early November.

2. **Current Situation Analysis**: As of November 2024, drought conditions appear to be improving slightly but still affecting a substantial portion of South Carolina. Even with a decrease from 100% to 72% of the state being under drought, this still represents a significant amount, potentially impacting the population count in affected areas.

3. **Impact of La Niña**: La Niña is expected to bring below-average rainfall, exacerbating drought conditions. However, the forecast for above-normal precipitation in parts of the eastern U.S. during winter is a counterbalance, but it may not significantly alter drought status by the end of December.

4. **Population and Settlement Patterns**: South Carolina's population is growing, including an influx of new residents that could be settling in areas already prone to drought. This demographic shift can influence the number of people residing in drought-affected areas.

5. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views**: While the local forecasts and current conditions should be considered heavily, global climate patterns like La Niña should not be dismissed entirely as they are a significant factor in predicting weather patterns.

6. **Extrapolation of Trends**: Given the improvement in drought classification and expected climate trends, there is potential for ongoing changes in drought severity, though complete drought eradication by year's end seems unlikely.

7. **Degrees of Doubt**: There is uncertainty regarding how the drought cycle will evolve with changing weather patterns and the potential for significant precipitation in December.

Given these considerations:

- The articles highlight varying drought conditions but a recent trend towards improvement. However, full relief seems unlikely due to climatic influences and forecasted precipitation patterns.
- Historical and news analysis suggest caution, though there is room for more residents to not be in drought compared to being affected if precipitation forecasts materialize positively.

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 85.00%, but 77.00% being the most likely. Probability: 77.00%.

- The articles highlight varying drought conditions but a recent trend towards improvement. However, full relief seems unlikely due to climatic influences and forecasted precipitation patterns.
- Historical and news analysis suggest caution, though there is room for more residents to not be in drought compared to being affected if precipitation forecasts materialize positively.

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 85.00%, but 77.00% being the most likely. Probability: 77.00%.
2024-11-21 13:16:05,544 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30321:
To forecast whether South Carolina will have 300,000 or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024, I begin by establishing the reference class and base rate for drought occurrences. Historical data regarding South Carolina's drought conditions can be insightful, though variability in climate and weather conditions can complicate prediction.

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates**: South Carolina tends to experience cycles of drought. The present data shows drought conditions have fluctuated, with a significant portion of the state under drought as recently as early November.

2. **Current Situation Analysis**: As of November 2024, drought conditions appear to be improving slightly but still affecting a substantial portion of South Carolina. Even with a decrease from 100% to 72% of the state being under drought, this still represents a significant amount, potentially impacting the population count in affected areas.

3. **Impact of La Niña**: La Niña is expected to bring below-average rainfall, exacerbating drought conditions. However, the forecast for above-normal precipitation in parts of the eastern U.S. during winter is a counterbalance, but it may not significantly alter drought status by the end of December.

4. **Population and Settlement Patterns**: South Carolina's population is growing, including an influx of new residents that could be settling in areas already prone to drought. This demographic shift can influence the number of people residing in drought-affected areas.

5. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views**: While the local forecasts and current conditions should be considered heavily, global climate patterns like La Niña should not be dismissed entirely as they are a significant factor in predicting weather patterns.

6. **Extrapolation of Trends**: Given the improvement in drought classification and expected climate trends, there is potential for ongoing changes in drought severity, though complete drought eradication by year's end seems unlikely.

7. **Degrees of Doubt**: There is uncertainty regarding how the drought cycle will evolve with changing weather patterns and the potential for significant precipitation in December.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- As of November 14, 2024, drought conditions are improving with 72% of SC experiencing drought, down from 100%
- Earlier in November, only 36% of the state was under moderate drought
- The trend shows fluctuation but general improvement

2. Future Weather Patterns:
- La Niña is expected to impact the Carolinas this winter
- Historical data shows La Niña typically brings below-normal rainfall (25% below normal)
- Farmers' Almanac predicts above-normal precipitation for Southeast region
- Forecasts indicate potential cold snaps but mixed precipitation outlook

3. Key Factors:
- Population exposed to drought varies with both drought severity and population distribution
- SC's population is growing, especially in coastal areas
- Historical patterns show drought conditions can change rapidly with weather systems

4. Timeline Analysis:
- We need to predict conditions on December 31, 2024 (about 40 days from current data)
- Winter months typically show different drought patterns than summer
- Recent improvements suggest positive momentum

5. Risk Factors:

To forecast whether South Carolina will have 300,000 or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024, I must consider multiple factors using Tetlock & Gardner's superforecasting principles.

Initial Assessment:
Historical data indicates that drought conditions fluctuate with climatic patterns, especially with phenomena like La Niña. The reference class would include previous years with similar climatic conditions. South Carolina has experienced varying degrees of drought in recent years, making it sensitive to weather changes.

Evidence Analysis:
- Recent reports indicate 72% of the state is experiencing drought, a reduction from 100%, pointing to improvement but still a significant concern regarding persistence.
- Articles hint at La Niña's potential impact, often leading to drier winters in the Carolinas.
- Winter 2024/25 is projected to be "calmer, gentler," but historical La Niña winters suggest below-normal rainfall for the Carolinas.
- Previous drought conditions have sometimes taken considerable time to alleviate.

Balancing Inside and Outside Views:
The situation requires aligning the long-term climatic trends with current developments. While drought conditions seem to be improving, the dominance of La Niña suggests a cautious approach with possible challenges in reaching a clear non-drought status.

Clashing Causal Forces:
- Climatological factors (La Niña) suggest potential for persistent dry conditions.
- Current improvements and predicted precipitation in the short term could mitigate the extent of drought by year-end, but not fully resolve it.

Linear Extrapolation:
Current trends suggest some degree of mitigation, but the persistence of drought conditions hints that enough residents might still be affected by year-end, even if some relief is observed.

Degrees of Doubt:
Given the variability in climatic conditions and the uncertainty brought by predictions, there is significant variability and uncertainty, allowing for a more cautious forecast leaning towards drought persistence.

Forecasting Range:
Taking into account improvement in drought conditions but also considering that La Niña could hamstring complete relief, I propose a probability range where the state might still have a considerable number of residents living in drought by December 31, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

- Current improvements and predicted precipitation in the short term could mitigate the extent of drought by year-end, but not fully resolve it.

Linear Extrapolation:
Current trends suggest some degree of mitigation, but the persistence of drought conditions hints that enough residents might still be affected by year-end, even if some relief is observed.

Degrees of Doubt:
Given the variability in climatic conditions and the uncertainty brought by predictions, there is significant variability and uncertainty, allowing for a more cautious forecast leaning towards drought persistence.

Forecasting Range:
Taking into account improvement in drought conditions but also considering that La Niña could hamstring complete relief, I propose a probability range where the state might still have a considerable number of residents living in drought by December 31, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.
2024-11-21 13:16:32,600 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30321:
To forecast whether South Carolina will have 300,000 or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024, I must consider multiple factors using Tetlock & Gardner's superforecasting principles.

Initial Assessment:
Historical data indicates that drought conditions fluctuate with climatic patterns, especially with phenomena like La Niña. The reference class would include previous years with similar climatic conditions. South Carolina has experienced varying degrees of drought in recent years, making it sensitive to weather changes.

Evidence Analysis:
- Recent reports indicate 72% of the state is experiencing drought, a reduction from 100%, pointing to improvement but still a significant concern regarding persistence.
- Articles hint at La Niña's potential impact, often leading to drier winters in the Carolinas.
- Winter 2024/25 is projected to be "calmer, gentler," but historical La Niña winters suggest below-normal rainfall for the Carolinas.
- Previous drought conditions have sometimes taken considerable time to alleviate.

Balancing Inside and Outside Views:
The situation requires aligning the long-term climatic trends with current developments. While drought conditions seem to be improving, the dominance of La Niña suggests a cautious approach with possible challenges in reaching a clear non-drought status.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- As of November 14, 2024, drought conditions were improving with 72% of SC experiencing drought conditions, down from 100%
- Earlier in November (Nov 7), 36% of the state was under moderate drought
- La Niña conditions are expected to develop, which typically brings above-normal precipitation to the Southeast

2. Historical Context:
- SC has experienced fluctuating drought conditions throughout 2024
- The state saw improvements in drought conditions during fall 2024
- Drought conditions can change significantly over 1-2 months

3. Future Indicators:
- Farmers' Almanac predicts above-normal precipitation for Southeast region in winter 2024/25
- La Niña development (60% chance) suggests increased rainfall potential
- Cold snaps predicted for late January 2025, but this is after resolution date

4. Population Considerations:
- SC has grown by ~250,000 people since 2020
- Current population concentrated in urban areas
- Population growth could increase number of people affected by drought

5. Key Factors for December 31, 2024:
- Improving conditions as of latest data
- Seasonal patterns typically show winter as wetter
- La Niña influence likely to increase precipitation

6. Risk Factors:
- Drought conditions can persist despite predictions
- Historical volatility in drought patterns
- Population growth increases exposure

The trend shows improving conditions, and seasonal/La Niña patterns suggest continued improvement. However, given population growth and historical volatility, there's still a significant chance of reaching 300,000 affected residents.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 45.50%, with 35.50% being the most likely. Probability: 35.50%.

- Earlier in November (Nov 7), 36% of the state was under moderate drought
- La Niña conditions are expected to develop, which typically brings above-normal precipitation to the Southeast

2. Historical Context:
- SC has experienced fluctuating drought conditions throughout 2024
- The state saw improvements in drought conditions during fall 2024
- Drought conditions can change significantly over 1-2 months

3. Future Indicators:
- Farmers' Almanac predicts above-normal precipitation for Southeast region in winter 2024/25
- La Niña development (60% chance) suggests increased rainfall potential
- Cold snaps predicted for late January 2025, but this is after resolution date

4. Population Considerations:
- SC has grown by ~250,000 people since 2020
- Current population concentrated in urban areas
- Population growth could increase number of people affected by drought

5. Key Factors for December 31, 2024:
- Improving conditions as of latest data
- Seasonal patterns typically show winter as wetter
- La Niña influence likely to increase precipitation

6. Risk Factors:
- Drought conditions can persist despite predictions
- Historical volatility in drought patterns
- Population growth increases exposure

The trend shows improving conditions, and seasonal/La Niña patterns suggest continued improvement. However, given population growth and historical volatility, there's still a significant chance of reaching 300,000 affected residents.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 45.50%, with 35.50% being the most likely. Probability: 35.50%.
