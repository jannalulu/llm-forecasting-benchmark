**How a second Trump presidency is likely to threaten abortion rights and women's healthcare globally**
A second Trump presidency is likely to threaten abortion rights and women's healthcare globally, particularly in countries that rely heavily on US aid. The US is the largest donor of global health aid, providing $15.8 billion in 2022, and restrictions on this aid can have significant consequences. Trump is expected to reinstate the Mexico City Policy, also known as the global gag rule, which bans organizations providing abortion services from receiving US aid. This policy has been shown to have devastating effects on women's health, including increased maternal and child mortality, reduced access to contraception, and increased rates of unsafe abortions. Research has shown that when the global gag rule is in place, health organizations are forced to close services, stocks of contraceptives decline, and organizations stop providing services to reduce death from unsafe abortions. Leading reproductive health charity Marie Stopes International saw its funding fall by 17% in 2017 due to its refusal to agree to the terms of the global gag rule. It is critical that donors, especially those in Europe, announce their plans to step up their support to protect women's health and access to safe abortions, in order to prevent the closure of vital services. 'These restrictions create the precise opposite of what they set out to achieve, resulting in more abortions and more deaths. But more than that, they are deeply harmful and dangerous to women who have no say over a policy that presents a danger to their lives,' said a researcher.

**Trump Picks RFK As Health Secretary, Xi In Peru, Most Polluting City**
Donald Trump has selected vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the Secretary of Health and Human Services in his second White House administration. The World Health Organization has responded, stating that vaccines are 'absolutely critical' to global health. Meanwhile, Israel has struck south Beirut after the U.S. delivered a truce proposal, and U.S. President Biden has arrived in Peru for an APEC summit and meeting with Xi Jinping. In other news, Sri Lanka's ruling leftist coalition has won by landslide, and thousands have joined a march in New Zealand's capital over an Indigenous treaty overhaul. Shanghai has been ranked as the world's most polluting city, emitting 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases. Tennis star Frances Tiafoe has been fined $120,000 for swearing too much during a match. Additionally, Nissan is facing a record bond maturity wall in 2026, with $5.6 billion in debt due next year. Iranian officials have stated that another Trump presidency could not change their policies, and Jordan's leadership is holding its breath for Trump's return to the White House. The German longing for Italy has become a cliché worth analyzing, and North Korean strongman Kim Jong-un has called for speeding up the mass production of attack drones.

**Machado Warns Maduro: Negotiate Before January 10 for a Better Situation**
Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has urged President Nicolás Maduro to negotiate a peaceful exit from power before January 10, 2025, warning that his situation will be 'better' if he does so. Machado stated, 'One thing is a negotiation before January 10 and another thing is a negotiation after. For the regime, if they cling to power, the situation will be substantially more complex from that day on.' She emphasized that the Plataforma Unitaria Democrática (PUD) is working to create pressure, both inside and outside the country, to ensure that Edmundo González Urrutia, the PUD's candidate, is sworn in as president-elect in January. Machado believes that there is still time for a negotiation with Maduro, but that it must focus on a 'regime change' that ends the chavismo that has governed since 1999. She noted that Maduro's support is 'infinitesimal' among security forces, civilians, and military personnel, and that many actors close to the regime are aware that the sooner they negotiate, the better their situation will be. Machado stated, 'I truly believe that after January 10, the scenario changes completely. So, I do think that the incentives are for them to understand that the sooner they assume the irreversibility of the political change, their situation can be better.'

**Will the US Administration Provide Ukraine with the Allocated Aid Before January 20, 2025?**
Professor Igor Ayzenberg from the Manhattan University believes that the outgoing administration of US President Joe Biden will use all the allocated funds for Ukraine before January 20, 2025, to provide several large packages of military aid. The character of the military aid, particularly the provision of long-range weapons to Ukraine, will not change. Ayzenberg is confident that the Biden administration will not allow Ukraine to strike targets deep in Russia with American weapons, as this could lead to a nuclear attack by Russia. The expert expects that the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump will have a different policy towards Europe and Ukraine, which may lead to a decrease in support for Ukraine. Ayzenberg also notes that the position of the European Union on Ukraine will be influenced by the upcoming elections in European countries, which may lead to a shift to the right and a decrease in support for Ukraine. However, he also mentions that there are some exceptions among European politicians, such as the President of Poland Andrzej Duda and the Prime Minister of Italy Giorgia Meloni, who support Ukraine despite being from right-wing parties.

**Scholz Calls for Passage of Several Projects Before Early Elections**
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for the approval of several projects in the parliament before the upcoming early elections. During the government's statement to the parliament, Scholz said, 'We must make the most of the time left to us to pass laws that are very important and cannot be delayed.' He explained that the country is heading towards an election campaign, but noted that there are projects that can be agreed upon and have a democratic majority in the parliament. Scholz specifically mentioned the measures to alleviate the burdens related to the 'cold progress' on income tax, which is expected to come into effect on January 1, 2025. He also emphasized the need to speed up the approval of the government's growth initiative and to increase the child allowance by early 2025. Additionally, Scholz mentioned the need to amend the Basic Law to make the federal constitutional law more capable of addressing potential political influences. This comes after a week of the collapse of the governing coalition, following the withdrawal of the Free Democratic Party, the junior partner, from the coalition government. Scholz announced in his statement that he will request a vote of confidence in the government on December 16, paving the way for early parliamentary elections in late February 2025, about seven months before the scheduled regular elections in late September of the same year.

**German President Names 'Realistic Date' for Parliamentary Elections**
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has named 'a realistic date' for parliamentary elections as February 23, 2025, according to his official website. Before that, he plans to hold talks with the leaders of all parties represented in the Bundestag. Earlier, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had announced that he would request a vote of confidence from the parliament, which would allow for early elections in March. Then, the head of the opposition Christian Democratic Union, Friedrich Merz, demanded that they do this earlier, so that the elections could take place in January. Last week, Scholz announced that he had asked the President to remove the Minister of Finance, Christian Lindner, and he was forced to do so to prevent harm to the country, as stated by Scholz. 'I had to take this step to prevent damage to the country,' Scholz said. 'I had to ask the President to remove Christian Lindner as Minister of Finance.' Steinmeier's proposed date for the elections is seen as a compromise between the different parties. 'A realistic date for the elections is February 23, 2025,' Steinmeier said. 'I will hold talks with the leaders of all parties before that.'

**Simonovis: After January 10, Venezuela Will Change**
Former Commissioner Iván Simonovis stated that January 10, 2025, when the newly elected president is sworn in before the National Assembly in Venezuela, will be a turning point in the country's history: 'it will change the movie.' He believes that after this date, things in Venezuela will change, and the situation will shift in favor of the Venezuelan people. Simonovis emphasized that a negotiation with the chavismo to consolidate the opposition's 'break' with the regime should be with Vladimir Padrino López, as he is the one who can convince Maduro that the military will no longer support him, thus ending the revolution and dictatorship. Simonovis is convinced that the military wants to negotiate because they know that those who will be in trouble during a transition are those who have violated human rights, and the majority of the FAN is not implicated. He believes that the Venezuelan people have the right to be in their own country and that the current situation is unsustainable.

**Election Official Sandra Bauer on New Elections: 'It Would Be Crucial to Set a Date Soon'**
Miesbach's election official, Sandra Bauer, explains how new elections in January 2025 would affect the election offices in the district and how much lead time a typical election requires. Miesbach - After the collapse of the coalition government, the country is expecting new elections. Many are calling for these to be held as soon as possible in January. We asked Sandra Bauer, election official in Miesbach, how this would affect the election offices in the region and how much lead time a typical election requires. 'It's already a topic in our election office,' Bauer said. 'Since Thursday morning, preparations have been underway. I have parallel tasks as a civil servant and in the order office. Next week, I will move to a different office.' The federal election official has already said that new elections in January are possible. 'In principle, yes,' Bauer said. 'But for the election offices, it would be crucial to set a date for the new elections soon, because an election is associated with a huge amount of work. The rooms for the polling stations must be reserved in good time, so that no other event takes place there. We need to recruit election helpers. Fortunately, the city of Miesbach has a good pool of election helpers, and we always appoint election helpers, but it's a bit more difficult to do so at short notice. I also have to create the voter register, send out the election notices, and send out the postal vote documents. This takes some time. It can take up to two weeks for the election notices to be sent out. The notices must be sent out at least 21 days before the election. In addition, the parties are allowed to put up posters six weeks before the election. By then, the election boards must be in place. If we have snow in winter, this is a bit tight.' Bauer has never experienced early new elections before. 'No,' she said. 'In 2008, I was the deputy election official for the first time. Since 2018, I have been the community election official. Since then, I have often expected it, but it never happened.'

**Scholz Faces Pressure for Early Election as CDU and CSU Push for New Vote**
The CDU and CSU are putting pressure on Chancellor Olaf Scholz to hold a new election, which could lead to a earlier date for the confidence vote in the Bundestag. Scholz had previously stated that he would hold the confidence vote on January 15, 2025, but is now open to discussing an earlier date. However, there are significant hurdles to overcome, including the 60-day timeframe for the election, which would be shortened if the vote were held during the Christmas season or between the years. The Bundeswahlleiterin, Ruth Brand, has warned that a premature election could lead to 'unabwägbare Risiken auf allen Ebenen' and make it difficult to implement necessary measures. The Bundeswahlgesetz also poses a challenge, as it requires that election proposals for the constituencies and party lists be submitted 69 days before the election. CDU leader Friedrich Merz has called for the election to be held on January 19, 2025, just one day before the inauguration of the new US government. 'Am 20. Januar 2025, einem Montag, wird die neue amerikanische Regierung ins Amt treten', Merz said. 'Am 19. Januar könnte man in Deutschland Neuwahlen machen. Das sind von jetzt an gerechnet noch zweieinhalb Monate.'

**Navigating Uncertainties: A Call for Transition and Negotiations**
January 10, 2025, has become a deadline for everything to happen or nothing to happen. In reality, no one knows what will happen in the next two months, with desires and threats abound, and prophecies are plentiful. The online communication noise is high, but important events in history are complicated by the interests of those involved and are always unpredictable. The geopolitical context is complex, and as a country in the world, we weigh little, despite our oil and gold reserves. As an economy, we are among the last in the world. As a society, misfortunes abound, and pains are numerous, and it's not necessary to explain them because every Venezuelan worker and household has lived through them for many years, including forced emigration. In politics, there is only confusion, with a great fear and a great hope at the same time. The psychological climate is highly destabilizing for our psyche and daily life. As Immanuel Kant said, 'To prophesize is foolish,' but the future cannot be ignored, and we all need a horizon of life and goals. Politically, most of us made our decision on July 28 by voting for a democratic, necessary, and urgent change. Making it possible on January 10, in peace, is a general desire, but it will depend on the regime, whether it listens to the country or continues to listen to itself. The current situation of threats and repression is unsustainable in the long term, and the sensible thing is the transition proposed, with serious and realistic negotiations in the framework of mutual respect and with the constitution as a guarantee of compliance. Insisting on this may seem naive or idealistic, but history tells us that it is the best way to avoid greater evils. Thinking about the country, rather than our personal interests, and the common good, is necessary and sensible, and I still believe, despite everything, that politics and government are rational, civil, civic, and constitutional things. Moving from Machiavelli and Hobbes to Montesquieu, and from the 'man wolf' to politics and government as a matter of honest and competent people, subordinate to the constitution and right justice, and not to the tariffed, is allowed. Democratic alternability is vital for a robust democracy, and absolute respect for popular sovereignty.

**Germany May Change Its Economic Policy as Early as January**
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is facing increasing pressure to agree to early elections in January. According to a new ARD poll, two-thirds of voters want to hold national elections as soon as possible, while business groups are calling for an end to political turmoil. Scholz's decision to fire Finance Minister Christian Lindner, a representative of the FDP, has destroyed the 'Traffic Light' coalition (SPD, FDP, and Greens) and left the government without a majority in the lower house of parliament. The leader of the CDU, Friedrich Merz, and Lindner are both calling for early elections to end Germany's economic stagnation. Industrial lobbyists are also supporting the call for January elections, saying that 'every day with this government is a day wasted.' The SPD, Scholz's own party, also wants early elections. Scholz is advocating for elections in March, and is willing to face a vote of no confidence to allow President Steinmeier to dissolve the government. The CDU is leading in opinion polls, with over 30% of the vote, giving them a strong chance of winning the chancellorship after their defeat by the SPD three years ago. Other parties and factions are also supporting early elections, but for different reasons. It's worth noting that early elections in January would be a blessing for Germany, as the country will face an energy crisis starting in 2025 due to the end of Russian gas transit through Ukraine. Although Germany has stopped using Russian methane, it would be beneficial for the country to resume gas exports from Russia through the remaining 'Nord Stream 2' pipeline. However, it's unlikely that the right and conservatives will agree to this, but the left, represented by the Greens, have repeatedly expressed support for resuming direct gas supplies from Russia.

**Russian Elites Hope for Quick End to War with Trump Presidency**
Russian elites are counting on a quick end to the war, with some even suggesting that a Donald Trump presidency could lead to a peaceful resolution. According to sources close to the Russian government, Trump's election could bring about a change in the US stance on Ukraine, with the US exerting pressure on Kyiv to accept a compromise. 'When Donald Trump takes office, we can agree to start consultations,' said a Russian official. 'It would be convenient for him to negotiate, and there is no one to talk to now.' The sources also suggest that the Russian military will intensify its attacks on Ukraine in the coming months, with the goal of capturing as much territory as possible by January 2025, when Trump is expected to take office. 'We will advance before the inauguration [of Trump],' said a Russian official. 'It would be good to reach the administrative borders of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions by January.' Another official noted that if the Russian military is successful in its advances, and Ukraine retreats, it would be logical for the new US administration to suggest starting negotiations. 'When Donald Trump takes office and forms his team, we can agree to start consultations,' said the official. 'It would be convenient for him to negotiate.' However, not all Russian officials are optimistic about the prospects for a peaceful resolution. 'There will be no immediate turnaround,' said a source close to the Russian Foreign Ministry. 'Trump is also part of the system, and there will be no radical change.'

**Medvedev: US Presidential Elections Will Not Change Russia's Situation**
Russian Deputy Security Council Chairman Dmitry Medvedev stated that the upcoming US presidential elections will not change the current situation for Russia. According to Medvedev, Russia has no reason to have high expectations from the elections, as the positions of the candidates reflect the two-party consensus on the need for Russia's defeat. 'For Russia, the elections will change nothing, since the positions of the candidates fully reflect the two-party consensus on the need for our country's defeat,' Medvedev wrote in his Telegram channel. Former US Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker stated that if Trump wins the election, he may demand that Russian President Vladimir Putin withdraw Russian troops from the special operation zone. However, Volker noted that there are differing views on the conflict in Ukraine within Trump's administration, and Trump himself does not want to see the Kiev regime's defeat during his presidency. Trump has repeatedly stated that he can quickly resolve the conflict in Ukraine, and even claimed that he can do so before his inauguration in January 2025. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov welcomed any peaceful initiatives that could lead to a desired outcome, but emphasized that the conflict's root causes must be addressed for a full resolution. Putin stated that Russia is willing to make reasonable compromises to resolve the conflict, but the outcome must be in Russia's favor and take into account the country's realities.

**UK to Introduce New Electronic Travel Authorization System in 2025**
The United Kingdom will introduce a new Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) system for foreign visitors starting from 2025. The system will cover citizens of many countries, including those from the European Union (EU) and the United States (US). ETA applications will be made online and will be valid for two years. The application fee is set at 10 pounds. The ETA system aims to enhance the UK's border security and control the entry and exit of the country more effectively. This application is similar to the US ESTA system and the EU's ETIAS system. ETA will allow visitors to undergo security screening before their trip, helping to detect potential threats beforehand. The system will be phased in by 2025. Initially, ETA will be applied to citizens of seven Middle Eastern countries, and from January 2025, it will also cover citizens of the US, Australia, Japan, and Hong Kong. From April 2025, it will be mandatory for EU citizens. Irish citizens will be exempt from this application. This new regulation is also important for Turkish citizens planning to travel to the UK. Since the ETA system covers visitors from visa-exempt countries, there will be no change in the current visa application process for Turkish citizens.

**Belarusian Regime Warns Former Prisoners Ahead of Presidential Elections**
According to Euroradio.fm, the Belarusian regime is summoning former political prisoners to the militia before the presidential elections scheduled for January next year, where they receive 'official warnings' not to plan actions aimed at changing the government. The former prisoners, who have served sentences under 'political' articles or still have restrictions on their freedom, are required to sign a written commitment not to plan actions aimed at 'forcibly changing the constitutional order, seizing or maintaining power using unconstitutional methods.' Euroradio notes that it is unclear what specific actions are being referred to. The authorities have set the date for the new presidential elections on January 26, 2025. Since the rigged elections in 2020 and the refusal of Western countries to recognize Alexander Lukashenko as the winner, Belarus has been experiencing repression. The democratic opposition, forced into exile, has called the planned campaign by the regime 'non-elections.'

**Ukraine to Abandon Daylight Saving Time in 2025**
Only 40% of the world's countries change their clocks. In Africa, only Egypt adopts this change. In China, it is done except in the Xinjiang region. In Japan, New Zealand, and some parts of Australia, the time shift is not enabled. Now, another European country, Ukraine, has decided that 2024 will be the last year in which the clock will go forward and backward: a measure aimed at maintaining citizens' proactivity. Therefore, from 2025, Ukraine will officially join the list of countries that do not change their clocks, neither in winter nor in summer. Italy, Spain, and other European Union countries will continue to change their clocks at least until 2026, when the European Parliament is expected to make a final decision. The change in time affects people's biorhythm, having a negative impact on physical and mental health. 'After adjusting the clocks, citizens feel worse, their productivity decreases, and there is a worsening of chronic diseases,' says those who want to abolish this practice for a long time.'

**MSEC to Continue Working Until January 1, 2025, Says Ukrainian Parliament's Health Committee Head**
Ukrainian parliament's health committee head, Mikhail Raduts'kyi, announced that medical and social expert commissions (MSEC) will continue to work until January 1, 2025, when they are planned to be reformed. He stated this during a live broadcast. 'Thank you to the government, thank you to the minister. By the end of the week, the central MSEC in Kyiv should be liquidated', he said. Raduts'kyi emphasized that the central MSEC in Kyiv plans to be liquidated by the end of the week, while regional MSEC will continue to work under the old system until the end of the year. He hopes that new approaches to control will reduce the risk of scandals in this area. 'But under the control that will be there today, I hope that by the end of the year, there will be no loud scandals. I don't think these people are immortal and fearless. They need to understand that the whole country is watching them. So, I think it will be a bit easier. Because we cannot leave people without such a commission today', Raduts'kyi noted. He explained that 'we cannot say today that there is no MSEC, wait until January 1, while something new appears'. He also announced that the functions of the central MSEC in Kyiv, including control and consideration of complaints, will now be performed by the Institute of the Ministry of Health in Dnipro. This decision was made after the dismissal of the leaders, which took place on the backdrop of scandals. Raduts'kyi added that the government is doing everything possible to ensure that citizens do not feel the transition period in the MSEC system until the planned changes.

**Tight Schedule for Future Government's Budget 2025**
The future government of Michel Barnier will have to pass its budget through Parliament before January 1st and give it 70 days of debate. If it is not adopted before the end of the year, the functioning of the state will not be completely hindered, but it will have limitations. The countdown to the budget has started with several weeks of delay. According to the official calendar, the government should have already deposited its draft budget before the Council of State, before the official presentation in the Council of Ministers in mid-September, and then before the National Assembly on the first Tuesday of October. However, everything will be delayed due to the lack of a government. Two rules remain unchanged: the budget requires 70 days of debate and must be definitively adopted by December 31st at the latest. Without a budget by January 1st, 2025, the state could still continue to function. 'The principle of continuity of the life of the nation means that a government, even without a budget, can continue to pay civil servants, finance public services, based on the absence of income because, to collect taxes, it needs the authorization of Parliament', explains Benjamin Morel, a political scientist and professor at the University of Paris II.

**Russia and Belarus May Abolish Roaming from January 1, 2025**
According to Alexey Polischuk, director of the second department of CIS countries at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Russian and Belarusian mobile users in the Union State will be provided with communication services at comfortable rates, comparable to those in the mobile networks of both countries, starting from January 1, 2025. 'The significance of the complete abolition of roaming in the Union State is understood by both Russia and Belarus. This will have a positive impact on the development of tourism and the strengthening of contacts between people,' he said. Polischuk noted that significant work has been done to abolish the fee for incoming calls and simplify the lives of Russians and Belarusians who frequently travel between the two countries, starting from April 1, 2022. 'The next step is to ensure that Belarusian and Russian subscribers on the territory of the Union State are provided with communication services at comfortable rates, comparable to those in the mobile networks of both countries, starting from January 1, 2025. The relevant agreements were reached at the meeting of the High-Level Group of the Union State Government on September 27 in Minsk,' Polischuk added. He explained that the relevant government agencies are currently working with telecommunications companies to finalize the details.

**January 10: A New Date for Venezuela's Politics**
Venezuela is set to have a new date that could define the country's political future: January 10, 2025, the day when the new president will be sworn in. Both Nicolás Maduro, re-elected president, and Edmundo González Urrutia, his main contender, have stated that they will be sworn in before the National Assembly on that day. González Urrutia clarified that he will not be sworn in in exile, saying 'No es un escenario que lo tengo planteado en este momento. Mi juramentación es ante la Asamblea Nacional en Venezuela.' Maduro, on the other hand, has received an invitation from the Parliament to take office in January and has stated that he will 'Asistiré formalmente al cumplimiento del juramento constitucional.' Analysts believe that Maduro will likely start another term, as 'las opciones son absolutamente limitadas para la oposición si hablamos de ejercer el poder en el territorio venezolano y de materializar el control de las instituciones.' Benigno Alarcón, director of the Center for Political and Government Studies at the Universidad Católica Andrés Bello, suggests that the results of the July 28 election, which are still not detailed by the CNE, will be the factor of change within the political system. He also warns that if Maduro is sworn in, the people may lose interest in the electoral process and not attend future elections, leading to a 'espejismo electoral'.

**María Corina Machado: 'We're taking steps towards our freedom, but it's a hard road'**
María Corina Machado, leader of the Plataforma Unitaria, told millions of Venezuelans that they are living in dark times, but assured that they are taking important steps towards achieving the country's freedom. Machado expressed confidence in the Venezuelan people who are willing to 'build a free and luminous country', saying 'These are very dark times, but we know the size of our strength and determination. Every day we take a step forward towards our Liberty. It's very hard, and we knew it would be. Be assured that we will achieve it.' According to the Constitution, a new presidential mandate is scheduled for January 10, 2025. However, the CNE proclaimed Nicolás Maduro as the winner of the July 28 elections, and the chavismo has already stated that he will swear in before the National Assembly, despite the disputed results at the national and international levels. In contrast, Edmundo González, who allegedly won the election with over 7 million votes, has repeatedly stated that he plans to return to Venezuela to swear in as president, regardless of the chavista majority in Parliament.

**Basque Country Fiscal Reform Delayed Until 2025**
The fiscal reform in the Basque Country, which has been prepared by the foral governments of Araba, Bizkaia, and Gipuzkoa, will not be approved before 2025, according to the three regional presidents. The reform will be applied from January 1, 2025, retroactively. In a press conference, Ramiro Gonzalez, the president of Araba, Elixabete Etxanobe, the president of Bizkaia, and Eider Mendoza, the president of Gipuzkoa, were asked about the reform. In Araba and Bizkaia, the law will be presented before the end of the year. However, in Gipuzkoa, it is 'impossible' to present the reform before the end of the year, according to Mendoza, who also stated that Gipuzkoa is the only region that has formed a committee to examine the changes in taxes. The changes will be similar in the three regions, as the councils have a 'national perspective', but 'harmonization is not the same as unification', and small adjustments can be made in each region. The parliamentary process will not have a special impact on the Bizkaia Foral Council, as the EAJ and PSE-EE have a majority in the Basque Parliament. However, Etxanobe has extended her hand to the opposition. Regarding the offer made by EH Bildu to reach a general budget agreement in the institutions, Mendoza and Gonzalez, who are the two regional presidents who need an agreement, have considered it positive, although they have emphasized that the decision-making area is the region. 'Citizens ask for agreements to be reached', said Mendoza, and reminded that they have been negotiating with opposition parties in several areas since before the summer. 'If there is no agreement, we will not try', he added. Gonzalez has announced that the opposition will 'link' the fiscal reform to the budget negotiations, and although the two issues are separate, he does not see any obstacles to combining them. He hopes that the lack of elections in the short term will facilitate reaching an agreement.

**Akhara Parishad Proposes Renaming Shahi Snan and Peshwai at MahaKumbh 2025**
The Akhara Parishad has proposed renaming the Shahi Snan and Peshwai at the MahaKumbh 2025. According to the Parishad's president, Shrimahant Ravindra Puri, 'India is a secular country where the Constitution is supreme. Despite this, special facilities are being given to people of a particular caste and religion.' He emphasized the need for a uniform civil code in the country. The Parishad's members have also demanded that the government take strict action against love jihad and Hindu conversions. They have also proposed that the names of the Shahi Snan and Peshwai be changed before the MahaKumbh and sent to the Chief Ministers of the states where the Kumbh is held, so that they can take appropriate action. The Parishad's members have also made several other demands, including the protection of temples and the promotion of cow conservation. They have also demanded that the government ban the sale of meat and liquor in the areas surrounding the Kumbh. The Parishad's members have also proposed that the names of the ghats on the Ganga and Yamuna rivers be named after the deities of the 13 akharas. Shrimahant Ravindra Puri said, 'The names of the Shahi Snan and Peshwai will be changed before the MahaKumbh. We will send the new names to the Chief Ministers of the states where the Kumbh is held, so that they can take appropriate action.'

**Claudia Sheinbaum Announces Government Restructuring Before Taking Office**
Before taking office, Claudia Sheinbaum announced a complete restructuring of the Mexican government in January 2025 to reduce costs and adapt to new social programs. 'We will make a very important change in the government starting in January, so some colleagues who enter a position will then go to another one,' she said to the media upon arriving at her transition home. Sheinbaum stated that these changes aim to save money in the budget approved by the Mexican Congress each year for each department within the bureaucratic structure. Additionally, she explained that the changes also aim to work better with the new social programs she promised during her presidential campaign, such as economic support for women between 60 and 64 years old, children in basic education, and others. 'We will reduce government spending even more and also change its organizational structure so that it can work better with the new programs,' she expressed. Sheinbaum has already outlined some adjustments to the public administration she will lead for the next six years, including the creation of the Alimentación para el Bienestar department, which will concentrate the activities of Segalmex and Diconsa. The first has been involved in corruption and embezzlement accusations. She also changed the name of the Consejo Nacional de Humanidades, Ciencias y Tecnologías (CONAHCYT) and elevated its rank to Secretaría de Ciencias, Humanidades, Tecnología e Innovación (SCHTI), an institution that will be headed by Rosaura Ruiz. The changes announced by Sheinbaum come in the midst of the discussion of one of the last 20 reforms pushed by outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador in Congress to simplify the government's administration, which includes the elimination of seven autonomous bodies.

**Matviyenko Urges Businesses to Understand Tax System Changes**
Russian Senate Speaker Valentina Matviyenko has called for proactive, explanatory, and informative work with businesses ahead of the changes to the Russian tax system. According to Matviyenko, the tax system will undergo significant changes in 2025, and there are many nuances that businesses need to understand. She believes that training entrepreneurs and regional teams is necessary to help them grasp these complexities. Matviyenko emphasized the importance of explaining the new tax norms before they come into effect on January 1, 2025, saying, 'We should try to explain it as much as possible by January 1 next year. People don't always act with malicious intent; sometimes they act out of ignorance, lack of experience, or misunderstanding. To prevent this and avoid harming businesses, we need to constantly and actively conduct informational and explanatory work.'

**Ukrainian Parliament Passes Resolution to Change Names of 327 Populated Areas**
The Ukrainian parliament has passed a resolution to change the names of 327 populated areas as part of the country's 'decommunization' campaign. According to deputy Yaroslav Zhelensky, the resolution was adopted without discussion, with 281 deputies supporting it. The names of populated areas containing Russian and Soviet norms or Russianized names, such as Puschino, Michurin, Maxim Gorky, Kutuzovka, Suvorovo, and Nekrasovo, will be changed. Additionally, many names related to Soviet holidays or Soviet symbolism, such as Peretrovanka, Peremayske, and Maevka, will be renamed. Six populated areas were removed from the original bill, including Yuzhnoe, Yuzhno-Ukrainsk, Pavlograd, Sinelnikovo, and Peremaysk. The resolution was put to a vote in the Verkhovna Rada, but was initially blocked by some deputies. The renaming of streets and the removal of monuments to Soviet and Russian figures in Ukraine began in 2015 after the adoption of the 'decommunization' law. A new wave of anti-Russian and anti-Soviet sentiment swept the country in 2022, and in March 2023, the Verkhovna Rada passed a law on 'decolonization' of topographic names, requiring local authorities to change all geographic names related to Russia and the Soviet period.
