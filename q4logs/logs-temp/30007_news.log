**These 3 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2025 and Beyond | The Motley Fool**
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has reached a new high, and history suggests that bull markets last longer than bear markets. Three Dow stocks that have advanced this year and are set to soar in 2025 and beyond are Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA). Amazon has seen its stock soar 35% this year due to double-digit quarterly revenue growth and efficiency improvements, and a lower-interest-rate environment is expected to increase consumer buying power. Apple's solid moat has helped its iPhone stay on top, and the company is generating a new source of growth through services. Nvidia has reported triple-digit earnings growth quarter after quarter and is expected to benefit from the growth of the AI market, which is forecast to reach $1 trillion by the end of the decade. According to The Motley Fool, 'All of this should help Amazon's shares continue to march higher.' 'Apple has a long track record of growth and offers investors dividends.' 'Nvidia shares may not rise in one straight line, but the Blackwell launch and the billions of dollars in revenue the platform should generate might boost the stock next year.'

**Analysts Upgrade Apple Stock with Bullish Targets, Pushing Price Forecasts Higher**
Analysts have upgraded Apple's stock with bullish targets, pushing price forecasts higher. Monness Crespi & Hardt affirmed a buy stance and increased its target price to $245, citing Apple's high growth prospects and diversification of its product offering. Robert W. Baird raised its price target from $200 to $240, stating that new Apple products and leadership in the premium smartphone segment signal continuous revenue growth. Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating and increased its target price to $273, solidifying evidence that Apple can deliver considerable returns. The upgrades come as the broader market remains cautious, but give more credit to Apple and highlight its ability to continue selling its products, even in a credit crunch.

**Stocks Hit by Tech Rout as US Yields Climb Again: Markets Wrap**
The US stock market continued its losses for a third straight day, with the S&P 500 down about 1% and the Nasdaq 100 falling nearly twice as much. Nvidia Corp. led the decline among megacaps, while Apple Inc. sank after a closely followed analyst said iPhone 16 orders were cut by about 10 million units from the fourth quarter through the first half of 2025. Investors are cautious ahead of several key events, including big tech earnings, the US election, and the Fed meeting, which could be contributing to the market's skittishness. The term premium on 10-year Treasury notes has also reached its highest level since November, indicating that investors are demanding a higher yield for owning the debt rather than rolling over shorter-term securities.

**Prediction: Apple Stock Will Be Below $200 by the End of the Year**
Apple's stock is currently trading at $230, but a prediction suggests it will drop below $200 by the end of the year due to a lack of growth in the company's fundamentals. Apple's revenue has not increased since 2022, and the recent release of the iPhone 16 has not met expectations, causing Wall Street analysts to lower their earnings per share (EPS) projections from $1.60 to $1.55. Apple's stock is trading at a premium of 35 times trailing earnings and 31 times forward earnings, which is higher than most investors realize. According to the article, 'over the long haul, stock price movements are heavily correlated to earnings growth.' With Apple's EPS growth at 10% last quarter and expected to be 14% in the fourth quarter, the company's premium valuation may not be justified, and a correction in the stock price is possible.

**Prediction: Apple Stock Will Be Below $200 by the End of the Year | The Motley Fool**
Apple's stock is currently trading at $230, but a prediction suggests it could drop below $200 by the end of the year due to weak sales of the iPhone 16 and a lack of revenue growth since 2022. The company's fundamentals don't support its current stock price, and the pressure on Apple's business is high. Analysts have lowered their expectations for the upcoming quarter, and the stock's valuation is considered too high, with a 35 times trailing earnings and 31 times forward earnings premium. The author believes that there are better stocks to buy that trade at cheaper valuations and are growing faster than Apple.

**Apple's SWOT analysis: stock outlook amid CFO change and AI push By Investing.com**
Apple Inc. is undergoing a significant leadership transition with CFO Luca Maestri set to step down on January 1, 2025, and Kevan Parekh taking over. Despite this change, analysts expect a smooth transition, and Apple's financial performance remains strong, with projected growth in revenue and earnings. The company's aggressive share buyback program and upcoming iPhone 16 launch are expected to drive revenue growth and margin expansion. However, Apple faces intensifying competition in various product categories, and macroeconomic factors, regulatory challenges, US-China tensions, market saturation, and AI competition pose risks to its stock performance.

**Apple Shares Hit All-Time High: Time to Buy?**
Apple's shares have reached an all-time high, reflecting bullish momentum. The company is expected to report its next quarterly results on October 31, with modest growth forecasted, including a 5% climb in earnings per share and 5.6% higher sales than the year-ago figure. The Services segment, which has consistently exceeded expectations, is expected to be a key driver of growth, with a Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.8 billion in revenue, 15% higher than the year-ago mark. The valuation picture is a bit rich, with a forward 12-month earnings multiple of 30.5X, but the company's consistent earnings growth and strong cash-generating abilities make it a desirable investment. As one analyst noted, 'the stock continues to deserve a spot in any investor's portfolio.'

**Watch These Apple Price Levels as Stock Trades Near Record High**
Apple shares are near a record high after briefly touching $237.49 yesterday. Investors should monitor key overhead levels at $237 and $270, and crucial support levels at $233, $225, and $218. The stock has gained over 20% this year, but has traded sideways for three months due to concerns about the delayed rollout of Apple Intelligence. A bullish golden cross signal in June led to a continued uptrend, and the price broke above the ascending triangle's upper trendline on high volume. Investors should watch for follow-through buying to test $237, a decisive breakout above the all-time high to reach $270, and support levels during retracements.

**Apple Stock Awaits Next Move After Breaking Through Resistance**
Apple's stock was able to break through the short-term resistance at $233.09 on Tuesday, reaching new all-time highs. However, the recent price action suggests that the stock may be consolidating at these levels before continuing its upward trend. If the stock closes above $237.23, it would confirm the start of a new upward impulse. Without any resistance, the stock could potentially extend its gains to $260. As long as it remains above $221.33, the stock's minimum level after the last correction, there is no sign of weakness.

**Apple's Stock Price Hits New Historical High Amid iPhone 16 Demand**
Apple's stock price briefly exceeded $3.6 trillion, setting a new historical high, after the company announced an updated iPad mini and positive forecasts for iPhone 16 production expansion. However, the gains were limited to 1.1% at the close of the session, with the stock price settling at $233.85. Over the past six months, Apple's stock has risen by over 35%, more than twice the growth of the Nasdaq 100 index. The company's new iPhone 16 models are expected to be in high demand, with some features of Apple Intelligence becoming available to US users in late October and expanding in December. Outside the US, clients will not have access to these features until March 2025. Analysts at Morgan Stanley noted that the waiting times for iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models are shorter than their predecessors, but have increased slightly in recent days. The overall waiting times for ordered iPhone 16 models are approximately one week shorter than those for iPhone 15 models at a similar stage in the market cycle. Experts attribute this to Apple's desire to quickly saturate the market with its new smartphones, unlike in previous periods. As Bloomberg notes, 'the company's capitalization briefly exceeded $3.6 trillion, setting a new historical high.'

**Apple stock hits record intraday high on bullish Wall Street outlooks, positive iPhone sales data**
Apple's stock hit a record intraday high of $237.49 on Tuesday, surpassing its previous record of $237.23. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, Bernstein, and Evercore ISI have reiterated their Buy ratings on Apple stock. Positive preliminary iPhone shipment data from International Data Corporation (IDC) showed strong demand for Apple's previous smartphone models, with sales also boosted by the rollout of the iPhone 16. IDC's Nabila Popal said, 'Despite the staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence in markets outside the U.S., Apple will continue to grow in the upcoming holiday season.' Morgan Stanley noted that Apple's supply chain checks suggest that the company has asked its suppliers to prepare component inventories earlier than typical patterns to avoid supply constraints. Apple will begin its rollout of Apple Intelligence on Oct. 28, with more significant updates expected in December and March 2025. Analysts see the stock climbing further to $245.40 over the next 12 months, with earnings expected to rise 9% from last year to $1.59 per share.

**Apple's Stock Reaches All-Time High on AI-Powered iPhone Optimism**
Apple's stock reached an all-time high on Tuesday, driven by optimism that the company will benefit from the launch of AI-powered iPhones. The stock rose 2.7% to $237.49, surpassing its previous high in July. This surge has solidified Apple's position as the world's largest company, with a market value of over $3.6 billion. Apple's stock has risen 37% in the past six months, more than double the 15.5% gain of the Nasdaq 100 index. The company has been supported by the enthusiasm for its AI-powered iPhone, which was released last month, and its new iPad mini with similar features. Evercore ISI and Melius Research have both issued positive recommendations on Apple's stock, citing its 'unprecedented buyback' and 'strong upgrade cycle in the US, driven in part by AI'.

**Apple's Stock Price Reaches New All-Time High**
Apple's stock price reached a new all-time high on Tuesday, October 15. Analysts say that surpassing the previous record suggests that the market is positively valuing Apple's recent initiatives, such as new product launches and strong quarterly financial results. However, it's worth noting that reaching an intraday high does not guarantee that the stock will close at that level by the end of the session. As Apple has significant weight in indices like the Nasdaq and S&P 500, this could potentially boost them. 'Superar el récord anterior sugiere que el mercado está valorando positivamente las recientes iniciativas de Apple, como el lanzamiento de nuevos productos o los resultados financieros del último trimestre', expresaron analistas de mercado.

**Two Apple stock rivals to turn $100 into $1,000 in 2025**
With Apple (AAPL) stock reaching a new all-time high in July, some analysts expect it to hit a market capitalization of $4 trillion next year. However, other stocks like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) have the potential to bring substantial profit to their investors, possibly allowing them to turn an investment of $100 into $1,000 in 2025. Microsoft's significant investments in artificial intelligence and its vast product portfolio have led BMO Capital Markets to raise its price target to $500. Amazon's diversified income flows and recent launch of Project Amelia, an AI-backed selling assistant, make it a strong contender. Currently, MSFT stock stands at $418.16, while AMZN stock is at $184.55. While these stocks have strong foundations, trends in the stock market can easily change, and doing one's own research is critical.

**Wall Street SWOT: Apple stock faces transition as AI-driven upgrades loom**
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is undergoing a period of transition as it prepares for a change in financial leadership and positions itself for an anticipated wave of artificial intelligence-driven upgrades. The company's CFO, Luca Maestri, will step down on January 1, 2025, and be succeeded by Kevan Parekh. Analysts expect continuity in Apple's capital allocation strategy, which has prioritized share buybacks and dividends. The company's revenue is forecasted to grow at a 5.8% CAGR from fiscal year 2023 to 2025, with gross and operating margins expected to improve. Apple's near-term prospects are closely tied to the upcoming iPhone 16 launch and the integration of AI features into its ecosystem. Analysts are particularly focused on the potential for AI to drive a multi-year upgrade cycle for iOS devices. However, the initial reception of the iPhone 16 has been mixed, with some reports indicating muted demand for both pro and base models. Apple's stock closed at $229.00 on August 30, 2024, with a market capitalization of approximately $3.5 trillion. Analyst price targets vary widely, ranging from $186 to $276, reflecting differing views on the company's growth potential and market positioning.

**Apple Shares Are Trading Higher Today: What You Need To Know**
Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares are trading higher on Wednesday following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 4.75%–5%. This unexpected move reflects the Fed's increased confidence in managing inflation. The Fed also revised its economic growth forecast for 2024 down to 2% and lowered inflation projections for the same year. Apple's key supplier, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn), is advancing in the electric vehicle (EV) market, unveiling the LDK+ electric vehicle prototype with a room-like interior. Foxconn has approved a $246 million investment in Northern Vietnam for manufacturing EV parts, with operations expected to start in January 2025. Apple shares closed up 1.80% at $220.69 on Wednesday.

**Apple Stock Drops as iPhone 16 Sales Fell Short of Expectations**
Apple's stock dropped 2.4% after reports revealed that sales of the new iPhone 16 fell short of expectations, down 12% compared to last year's iPhone 15 launch. The main factors contributing to poor demand were the lack of new features and the absence of Apple Intelligence, which will not be available in the new phone until next October. According to Apple, Apple Intelligence will not be available in China until 2025, a time when the company is facing strong competition from Chinese companies in the Chinese market. Despite this, Apple's stock has still seen a 12.4% increase since the start of the year.

**S&P Static, Dow at All-Time High**
The S&P 500 remained relatively unchanged on Monday as investors await the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, during which interest rates are expected to be cut for the first time since 2020. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a new all-time high, increasing by 228.30 points to 41,622.08. Apple shares declined nearly 3% after analysts noted that shipping times could indicate lighter demand for iPhone 16 Pro models. Chip stocks, including Nvidia, Broadcom, KLA, and Marvell Technology, also fell due to investors taking off some of their bets. The S&P 500 is around 1% away from its July record and could notch a new all-time high this week. The Fed is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday and is widely anticipated to make its first interest rate cut since March 2022, which could lower borrowing costs and improve economic growth.

**Apple shares are breaking down and could be under pressure for months, according to the charts**
Apple shares are expected to break down and could be under pressure for months, according to charts. The weekly MACD signal has turned negative for the first time since January, indicating a loss of intermediate-term momentum. The weekly stochastics have also turned decisively lower since Apple failed to clear resistance from its July high. Initial support for Apple is near $213, but the company's largest component of the S & P 500, comprising nearly 7% of its weighting, would be a drag on the major indices if it experiences a corrective phase. Katie Stockton with Will Tamplin from Fairlead Strategies notes that long-term overbought conditions are in place for Apple, presenting an additional headwind for the company over the next few months.

**US Stock Market Experiences Mixed Performance Ahead of Federal Reserve Meeting**
The US stock market experienced a mixed performance on Monday, ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting, which is expected to lower interest rates for the first time since 2020. Apple's stock decline also affected the market. The S&P 500 index fell by 0.17%, while the Nasdaq composite index fell by 0.83%, and the Dow Jones index rose by 0.44%. Apple's shares fell by 3.23% after analysts, including Bank of America and J.P. Morgan, indicated that shipping times may indicate lower demand for the iPhone 16 Pro compared to the previous year. The S&P 500 index is within 1% of its highest level in July and is expected to reach its highest level ever this week. After a difficult start to the weak historical month of September, the three main US indices ended last week's trading session in the green, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices recording their best week of 2024. The Federal Reserve meeting is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, and it is widely expected to be the first interest rate cut since March 2022. This week's cut is a critical step, as many investors hope it will lead to lower borrowing costs for companies and improved overall profit growth, boosting economic growth. The current borrowing rate is between 5.25-5.5%. Market participants are divided on whether the central bank will cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points, according to the FedWatch tool from CME. Brian Belsky, a senior investment strategist at BMO Capital, said, 'Stocks tend to record strong gains during cycles, where initial rate cuts can support economic expansion.' He added in a note released on Friday, 'As long as nothing breaks in the economy, US stocks remain stable within an advancing market, but with significantly strong performance over a full year before the first interest rate cut, future gains are likely to be more subdued compared to historical standards, in our view.'
