**Trump Names Elon Musk to Lead 'Department of Efficiency'**
US President-elect Donald Trump has appointed billionaire Elon Musk, owner of X, Tesla, and SpaceX, to lead the Department of Efficiency in his second term, which begins on January 20, 2025. According to Trump, Musk will work in partnership with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who made his fortune in biotechnology and finance and is a climate crisis denier. Trump stated, 'Together, these two great Americans will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, reduce excessive regulations, cut unnecessary expenses, and restructure federal agencies.' Trump added, 'It will be potentially the 'Manhattan Project' of our era.' Trump said, 'To lead this kind of drastic change, the department will provide advice and recommendations from outside the government and collaborate with the White House to guide a large-scale structural reform and create a never-before-seen business approach. I'm looking forward to Elon and Vivek bringing changes to federal bureaucracy.' Trump stated that the work of the two appointees will end 'at the latest on July 4, 2026.' Trump said, 'It will be the perfect gift to America on the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.' Musk was one of Trump's main campaign supporters, but his arrival in government raises questions about potential conflicts of interest. Musk's companies have large contracts with the US administration, particularly in the aerospace field, and their activities are subject to federal regulations, such as the development of autonomous cars by Tesla.

**Elon Musk to Lead 'Department of Government Efficiency' in Trump's Incoming Administration**
US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, will lead the 'Department of Government Efficiency' alongside Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump said, 'Together, these two Americans will pave the way for my administration to dismantle bureaucratic red tape, reduce unnecessary regulations, cut wasteful spending, and reorganize federal agencies - a crucial step for the 'Save America' movement.' This appointment is part of a series of appointments for Trump's incoming administration, including the appointment of his campaign manager, Susie Wiles, as the head of the White House staff. Trump has decided not to include his children in his new administration, unlike his first term, when his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner held advisory positions in the White House. Trump is preparing to return to the White House after winning the 2024 presidential election and is set to take office officially on January 20, marking the beginning of his second term after a four-year absence. The expectations are high for the policies Trump will adopt in his second term, which include issues related to the economy, trade, foreign policy, and immigration.

**Will the Alliance Between Trump and Musk Break Down?**
Elon Musk and Donald Trump, the world's two most powerful men, have formed a strong alliance in recent months. However, experts predict that a disagreement between the two is inevitable due to their strong personalities. According to CNN, Trump will not share the spotlight with Musk during his 2024 presidential campaign, despite praising Musk in the past. Musk played a significant role in Trump's campaign, particularly in the key state of Pennsylvania, and shared pro-Trump content on social media platform X. Insiders close to Trump say, 'Elon is very temperamental and Trump is too. I don't think Trump will enjoy the attention Elon will bring. He's an attention-seeker.' Musk's net worth increased by approximately $12 billion after Trump's landslide victory, fueling speculation that Musk may have a role in Trump's new administration.

**CNN's Kaitlan Collins Reports Elon Musk Is At Mar-a-Lago Influencing Trump, But Unlikely to Get an Official Role**
CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins reported that Elon Musk has been a frequent presence at President-Elect Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home, influencing his decisions and weighing in on staffing choices. Collins stated, 'Musk has been in the room when world leaders have called Trump. And tonight, we've learned he's also weighing in on staffing decisions, making clear his preference for certain roles even publicly.' While Musk is not expected to take a formal position in Trump's administration, he is reportedly having a significant influence from the outside. According to ABC News, Musk was present on at least two phone calls Trump had with foreign leaders, including a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during which Trump handed the phone to Musk so he could speak to Zelenskyy as well. Musk is also backing Florida Senator Rick Scott as the next leader of the Republican conference to replace Mitch McConnell.

**Trump's White House circle takes shape amid fears over extremist appointments**
Donald Trump's second administration is taking shape, with a range of names being considered for key roles. Susie Wiles has been appointed as White House chief of staff, with Trump praising her as 'tough, smart, innovative... universally admired and respected'. However, the role is seen as a thankless task, with Trump's previous four chief of staffs failing to flourish. Other figures linked to the role include Mike Davis, a lawyer and former Senate aide who has made headlines for threatening New York Attorney General Letitia James and has been linked to the role of attorney general. Davis has also asked for 'pardon and commutation lists' and has expressed a desire to 'drag the dead political bodies of Trump's opponents through the streets'. Trump is also considering Robert F Kennedy Jr for a prominent role in health policy, despite his vaccine conspiracy theories and support for removing fluoride from public drinking water. Other figures linked to the administration include Elon Musk, who has backed Trump's campaign and has said he expects a role in slashing the federal budget, and Stephen Miller, a far-right immigration hawk. Names in the running for secretary of defense include Christopher Miller, a former special forces officer and Project 2025 author, and Mike Waltz, a Florida congressman and former Green Beret. Marco Rubio is widely touted for secretary of state, while Bill Hagerty and Richard Grenell are also reported to be under consideration. Numerous plutocrats, including John Paulson, have been suggested for treasury secretary.

**Trump's Potential Cabinet: A Who's Who of Names and Positions**
Donald Trump's transition team is expected to announce a list of ministers and advisors in the coming days. Jason Miller, a Trump advisor, said, 'There are people who are returning, others who are new, not just big names, but also Democrats, independents, and business leaders.' Trump has already nominated Susie Wiles as his chief of staff, a highly strategic position that has never been held by a woman. Mike Lee and Eric Schmitt are mentioned as potential candidates for the position of Secretary of State. Richard Grenell, a former ambassador to Germany, is also being considered for the role. Grenell has been described as 'a diplomat from the shadows' and has a reputation for being tough. He has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the position of National Security Adviser, which could make Marco Rubio, a senator from Florida, the new Secretary of State. Mike Pompeo, a former Secretary of State, could be chosen to lead the Pentagon. The CIA directorship could go to John Ratcliffe, a former congressman from Texas, or Kash Patel, a former White House staffer. The position of Treasury Secretary could be disputed between Scott Bessent and John Paulson, two billionaires who are patrons of investment funds. Elon Musk, the world's richest man, could be tasked with reorganizing the federal administration, potentially leading to significant budget cuts. Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a nephew of President John F. Kennedy, could be responsible for public health policies, despite being critical of vaccination.

**Trump Begins Appointments, Names Susan Wiles as White House Chief of Staff**
US President-elect Donald Trump has announced the appointment of his campaign manager, Susan Wiles, as the White House Chief of Staff, his first appointment in his upcoming administration. Trump said in a statement, 'Suzi Wiles helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history.' He added that Wiles 'will continue to work tirelessly to make America great again,' referring to his campaign's slogan. Trump also reminded that Wiles will be the first woman in US history to hold this position, considering it 'a well-deserved honor.' The White House Chief of Staff is considered the most strategic center of power in the US executive branch, equivalent to the position of Head of the Presidential Office or Head of the Royal Court in other countries. It is expected that Trump's administration will feature several controversial figures, including Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Musk is likely to play a key role in the administration after his active involvement in Trump's campaign. Trump may also appoint Kennedy, the son of the late president and a former independent candidate who has become an ally, to oversee public health responsibilities. Kennedy has been critical of vaccination and stated on NBC that he 'will not prevent people from getting vaccinated,' but believes Americans should be able to 'make their own decisions.' Trump is also expected to appoint Musk to oversee a federal administration overhaul, as one of the world's richest men and a strong advocate for reducing government involvement.
