**Post-election poll shows economic confidence up; Biden ratings down**
A recent Gallup poll shows that American's confidence in the economy has improved, with a 9-point increase in the Economic Confidence Index to -17 in November. However, President Joe Biden's approval rating has dropped to 37%. The Republican Party has made historical gains nationwide, with increased optimism and a slight increase in approval for Congress. According to the report, 'higher economic confidence is being driven primarily by Republicans,' with a 29-point boost in confidence reaching -43 this month. The poll also shows that Americans are focusing on three main issues: the government, immigration, and the economy, with 11% naming inflation as a key issue. The results are from a Nov. 6-20 Gallup poll, where 26% rated the economy as excellent or good, while 32% say it is 'only fair' and 40% poor.

**Postelection: Economic Confidence Up; Biden Ratings Down**
A Gallup poll conducted after the 2024 elections found that Americans' confidence in the economy has improved, with 36% believing it is getting better and 55% thinking it is getting worse. This shift is largely driven by Republicans, whose economic confidence index score gained 29 points to -43. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden's job approval rating has dipped to 37%, with 80% of Democrats and 7% of Republicans approving of his job performance. Fewer Americans are satisfied with the way things are going in the U.S. now (22%) than before the election (26%). Congress' approval rating has ticked up to 19%, with political independents and Democrats viewing it slightly more positively than before the election.

**Trump's approval rating now 20 points higher as president-elect**
A recent Harvard CAPS/Harris poll found that 54% of Americans approve of President-elect Trump's job performance, while 40% disapprove. This is a 20-point increase from his final approval rating as president in January 2021. Trump's approval rating is highest among Republicans, with 91% approving of his job performance. However, nearly three-quarters of Democrats disapprove of his performance. The poll also found that a majority of those aged 18-54 approve of Trump's job performance, while a small majority of those older than 65 disapprove. Trump has nominated several unorthodox cabinet picks, including former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz as his attorney general and Fox & Friends weekend host Pete Hegseth as his secretary of defense. 'It's a good start he is above 50 in job approval so far -- it will be important for him to stay above that level to govern effectively,' said pollster Mark Penn. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden's approval rating stands at 42%.

**An ordinary election**
The 2024 election results show that Republicans won a significant victory, but it was not a sweeping repudiation of Democrats. Rather, it was an ordinary election, with little change from 2016. According to political scientists John Sides, Chris Tausanovitch, and Lynn Vavreck, national politics has been 'calcified,' with two equal-sized coalitions at loggerheads, resulting in repeat elections. Despite President Biden's low approval rating and voters' top concerns being the economy and immigration, which favored the GOP, Vice President Harris won 48.1%, beating Biden's approval by a wide margin and holding Trump to below 51%. Matthew Dowd notes that no modern incumbent president or vice president has run in the popular vote ahead of the president's approval rating until now. The election results mainly reaffirm voters' persistent anti-incumbent sentiment, and Republicans may be tempted to claim a stronger mandate than the voters intended, leading to policies that are more extreme and disruptive than the public wants.

**Biden vs. Trump latest approval ratings: Who is more popular?**
A week after his election victory, President-elect Donald Trump remains more popular than President Joe Biden, according to the latest tracking of poll averages. Trump's approval rating stands at 44% favorable and 52% unfavorable, a net of -8. Biden's numbers are worse, with 39% approval and 56% disapproval, a negative approval rating of 17 percentage points. Vice President Kamala Harris has the best approval rating of the three, but it is also underwater, with 46% approval and 48% disapproval. ABC News reported that state polls overestimated support for Harris by an average of 2.7 points in competitive states, which were eventually won by Trump.

**Joe Biden's popularity is sliding. Will it fall to a historic low?**
Joe Biden's approval ratings have been sliding, with a 3.6-point drop in less than six weeks, according to poll tracker site 538. His current rating of 38.7 percent is only slightly above his record average low of 36.9 percent, which he reached after a poor CNN debate performance against Donald Trump. Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, attributes the decline to negative media coverage and scrutiny of Biden's performance as an advocate for Kamala Harris. Reeher notes that Biden's legacy will not be significantly impacted by his slipping approval ratings, but rather by his decision to step down as the nominee at the 11th hour and the events leading up to that. The country has faced decades-high levels of inflation during Biden's time in office, which has been cited as a key reason voters backed Trump over Harris in the 2024 election. Biden's unpopularity is similar to that of Republican President George W. Bush's in the final stages of his second term in office.

**Biden's Approval Ratings Fall Ahead of US Election**
US President Joe Biden's approval ratings have fallen in the past two months, dropping from 42% in September to 38.5% currently, according to fivethirtyeight.com. This represents a decline of 3.4 percentage points. Additionally, only 30% of voters are satisfied with the current state of the economy, according to a CNN poll. Biden's popularity had briefly increased to 40% after he announced his decision not to seek re-election in July, but it has since declined to its current level. Following the party's defeat in the recent election, some Democratic Party members have criticized Biden, with Bill Ackman, a long-time Democratic donor, stating, 'The party needs a complete restart.' Others have accused the party of lying about Biden's mental fitness until a disastrous TV debate with Trump in June raised concerns.

**NBC Panel Questions Whether Democrats' Coup To Remove Joe Biden Was A Good Idea**
An NBC panel questioned whether the Democrats' push to remove President Joe Biden from the top of the Democrat ticket was a good idea after Republican nominee Donald Trump won key battleground states. The pressure from Democrats for Biden to drop out may have backfired, as former White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, 'It will begin, it will begin depending on the outcome.' The panelists noted that it is 'virtually impossible' for an incumbent party to win with an unpopular president, citing Vice President Kamala Harris's low favorability rating of -17 in June 2023 and her current disapproval rating of 49.2% and approval rating of 44.3%.

**CNN Exit Poll: Biden approval rating in Wisconsin worst of the swing states**
According to CNN's exit polls, President Joe Biden's approval rating in Wisconsin was the lowest among swing states, with only 38% of voters approving of his job performance, compared to 61% who disapproved. This is lower than other battleground states, including Arizona (43%), Georgia (41%), Michigan (42%), North Carolina (42%), and Pennsylvania (43%). Wisconsin's 21,000-vote margin for Biden in 2020 makes it a crucial state for former President Donald Trump's chances of victory, and could unlock a path to 270 Electoral College votes if he can also secure Michigan and Pennsylvania.

**US Presidential Election 2024: A Close Race and Limited Predictions**
The US presidential election 2024 is approaching, and polls are predicting a close race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. To understand the current state of the election, it's essential to look at the polls and their limitations. FiveThirtyEight aggregates national approval ratings for the presidential candidates, but even these averages are not precise predictions. Past elections have shown that polls and predictions have limited accuracy in the US. The 2016 election was a prime example, with many institutes predicting a landslide victory for Hillary Clinton, but the actual outcome was different. The 2020 election also had a close outcome, but the winner, Joe Biden, was correctly predicted. The election on November 5 will not only determine the next president but also the balance of power in the US Congress. The Electoral College will meet on December 17 to cast their votes, and the official results will be announced on January 6, 2025. To win the presidency, a candidate needs to secure a majority of the 538 electoral votes. The number of electoral votes each state receives is based on its population and the number of senators and representatives it has in Congress. Some states have a 'winner takes all' system, where the winner receives all the electoral votes, while others, like Nebraska and Maine, allocate their electoral votes based on congressional districts. The outcome of the election will depend on various factors, including the number of mail-in ballots and the timing of their counting. In some states, mail-in ballots can be counted immediately, while in others, they can only be counted on election day or later. This can lead to delays in the counting process and make it difficult to predict the outcome of the election.

**Why Is the US Presidential Race Even Close?**
The 2024 US presidential election is a close contest due to several factors. For Democrats, the incumbent party's nominee, Kamala Harris, is facing strong electoral headwinds, with President Joe Biden's low approval rating of 39% (according to Gallup) and the party's struggles with issues such as Ukraine, Gaza, and migrants crossing the southern border. Harris's approval rating as vice president is 45%, six points higher than Biden's. On the other hand, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has managed to center the election on himself, thrilling many voters while appalling many others. Trump's high unfavorability rating and low favorability rating since 2016 have made him a polarizing figure. The resistance to Trump has remained consistently high, with his Gallup approval rating never cracking 50% while in office. The American electorate's decision is being influenced by both quotidian concerns and Trump's outsize personality, with hundreds of thousands of voters putting aside their party loyalty and policy priorities to stand against a candidate they consider unfit for the presidency.

**Three Indicators Suggesting a Trump Victory: 'You Won't Be Able to Say You Weren't Warned'**
According to data analyst Harry Enten, three indicators could be unfavorable to Democrats. Enten, a leading data analyst at CNN, presented a segment on Wednesday, October 30, 2024, highlighting three elements that he considers 'obvious' signs of a potential Donald Trump victory in the presidential election. If Trump wins the election, 'you won't be able to say you weren't warned,' he told viewers. The three predictive indicators are 'voter satisfaction with the direction of the country, the low approval rating of current President Joe Biden, and the number of Republican voters registering to vote.' Based on these indicators, Kamala Harris would be in a weak position. 'Since 1980, the ruling parties have been re-elected when the approval ratings on the direction of the country were around 42%', Enten noted, adding that the approval ratings of losing parties usually range from 25% to 30%, which is close to the current average of 28%.

**CNN Data Reporter Spots 3 'Obvious' Signs That Could Point To Trump Win**
CNN's Harry Enten suggested that if former President Donald Trump wins the 2024 election, 'the signs all along will have been obvious.' Enten cited low voter satisfaction polls, President Joe Biden's poor approval rating, and Republican registration numbers in battleground states as key factors that could explain a Trump victory. According to historical data, incumbent parties have won reelection when approval ratings on the direction of the country are around 42%, while losing parties average around 25%. The current average is 28%, which Enten said has never been a winning factor for an incumbent party. Enten also noted that Biden's low approval rating and the high numbers of new Republican voters in battleground states could be critical factors in a Trump win.

**Biden proposed her name as Democratic Party candidate for U.S elections, but Kamala Harris repeatedly snubs his requests to campaign**
US Election 2024 is heating up as President Joe Biden's attempts to rally support for Vice President Kamala Harris face unexpected resistance. Harris has been consistently declining Biden's requests for joint campaign appearances, leaving many to speculate about the tension between the two leaders. Harris has emphasized, 'My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency,' during a recent interview, aiming to show voters her distinct vision for the future. Despite this, the White House has stated that they remain in close communication with Harris' campaign to determine how Biden can assist. Harris faces pressure from both Democratic strategists and voters to separate her image from Biden's, asserting her independence. According to RealClearPolitics, Biden's approval rating is struggling, sitting at 40.8% approval and 56.6% disapproval. Harris has consistently defended Biden in public, but behind the scenes, there is speculation that if she wins on November 5, she may overhaul her staff, which has led to some Biden loyalists feeling uneasy about their roles.

**Biden to Cast His Vote in Early Voting, but Campaign with Harris Remains Uncertain**
The White House announced that US President Joe Biden will cast his vote in the early voting for the US elections today. According to Axios, Biden wanted to campaign with his running mate and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in the days leading up to the election, but her campaign has not agreed to this. Harris' campaign has repeatedly told Biden that they will 'follow up with him'. Sources close to Axios said that Biden's team had scheduled time for campaign events, but Harris' team has not taken advantage of these opportunities. Harris' campaign believes that Biden is a political liability at a critical moment in the campaign, but they are hesitant to say so directly. One source described the situation as a 'slow separation' between two partners, as Harris' team and allies value Biden's services but are wary of associating Harris with the president, who has low public approval ratings. Biden's approval rating is at 39%, according to a poll average tracked by 538. A source said that Biden is reminding people of his past four years in office, rather than 'the new path forward'. There are currently no scheduled campaign events that bring Biden and Harris together before the November 5 election. Harris' aides have privately expressed frustration with Biden's focus on his own campaign rather than the presidential race that Harris is running in. Harris has faced increasing pressure in recent days to explain to voters how she would lead the country differently from Biden if she wins the presidency.

**CNN's Harry Enten Says Biden's 'Disapproval Rating' May Spell Doom For Harris' Election Bid**
CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said that President Joe Biden's low approval rating of 36% could signal a loss for Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming election. Historically, past presidents with net negative approval ratings have not been followed by a successor from their own party. Enten noted that presidents with negative approval ratings, such as Harry Truman and Lyndon Baines Johnson, were not succeeded by a Democrat. Enten said, 'Can Joe Biden actually be succeeded by a Democrat? Can Kamala Harris overcome Joe Biden's net negative approval rating? Only time will tell, but history ain't so kind, guys.' The New York Times/Siena College's national poll found Harris and former President Donald Trump tied at 48%, a shift from their previous poll which found Harris leading Trump 49% to 46% nationally.

**Wall Street Journal Poll for US Elections 2024: Will Donald Trump Actually Come Out Victorious over Kamla Harris in the 2024 Elections?**
The latest Wall Street Journal poll for the US elections 2024 shows Donald Trump gaining momentum and leading Kamla Harris by two percentage points. Trump's approval rating has increased to 52%, with voters citing immigration, crime, and the economy as major issues. In contrast, Harris's approval rating has dropped, with voters questioning her stance on these issues. Trump's campaign has linked Harris to former President Joe Biden's policies, and Trump has emphasized his own mastery of immigration issues. The poll suggests that Trump's constant press conferences and claims of bringing change to the country's economic conditions have resonated with voters, who may prefer the 'unhinged' Trump over Harris's more cautious approach. As the elections approach, Harris is trying to attract undecided voters, but the outcome remains uncertain.
