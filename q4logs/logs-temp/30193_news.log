**Could Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Grow 10x Over the Next 3 Years?**
Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is one of the 8 Stocks That Could 10X Over the Next 3 Years. As the new US presidency takes office in January 2025, investors are concerned about the impact of new policies on big tech. Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO of IBM, expects more innovation and less regulation in the tech sector, with 'guardrails.' William Kerwin, an analyst at Morningstar Technology, emphasizes that tariffs will be a crucial element, with a proposed 60% tariff on Chinese imports. However, he is optimistic about mergers and acquisitions and antitrust regulations, expecting more deals and regulations focused on platforms and use cases rather than specific companies or products. Kerwin also believes that companies well-exposed to artificial intelligence are overvalued, but sees opportunities in the chip equipment and semiconductor sectors, particularly in companies that are well-positioned despite cyclicality worries and fears of AI maturity. 'High exposure to China does not necessarily equate to high investment risk,' Kerwin notes. 'I do not expect significant breakups, but regulations that erode the competitive advantages big tech companies enjoy at the moment.'

**Meet the 3 Supercharged Growth Stocks That Will Be Worth $4 Trillion by 2025, According to a Certain Wall Street Analyst | The Motley Fool**
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes that three companies, Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft, will be the first to achieve a $4 trillion market cap within 12 months. Nvidia is currently the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of $3.38 trillion, and Ives thinks it will only take stock price gains of about 18% for Nvidia's value to surpass $4 trillion. Apple, with a market cap of roughly $3.35 trillion, needs stock price gains of just 20% to clear the $4 trillion threshold. Microsoft, with a market cap of $3 trillion, is just 32% below the $4 trillion benchmark. Ives notes that the companies are well-positioned to benefit from the growing adoption of generative AI, with Nvidia's GPUs being the 'new oil or gold in the tech world' and Microsoft's AI revenue on track to exceed a $10 billion run rate in Q2.

Ives believes that Nvidia is the most likely to reach $4 trillion first due to its dominance in the GPU market and its expanding margins. Apple's loyal customer base and improving macroeconomic environment could drive a new supercycle for the company. Microsoft's broad AI strategy and growing adoption of AI services could also drive the company's stock higher.

**Nvidia becomes world's largest company overtaking Apple, market cap crosses $3.43 trillion amid rise of AI**
Nvidia Corp. has become the world's largest company, surpassing Apple's market capitalization of $3.38 trillion with a market cap of $3.43 trillion.

**Microsoft Poised to Surpass Nvidia as Most Valuable Company Next Year**
A new analysis by 'Investor’s Business Daily' suggests that Microsoft could surpass Nvidia as the most valuable company in the world next year. According to the analysis, Microsoft's market capitalization is expected to reach $3.7 billion, surpassing Nvidia's $3.68 billion. The analysis is based on data from S&P Global Market Intelligence and MarketSurge. Megan Horneman, Chief Investment Officer at Verdence Capital Advisors, stated, 'It is expected that the information technology sector will have the highest growth rate of all S&P 500 sectors (15.6%) compared to the previous year.' If Nvidia were excluded from the information technology sector, the growth rate would be lower (8%). The analysts' current price targets for Nvidia leave little room for growth, with a potential increase of 4.4% in the next 12 months. In contrast, Microsoft's price targets suggest a potential increase of 17%. The majority of analysts recommend buying the Microsoft stock.

**Will IBM Be Worth More Than Microsoft by 2035? | The Motley Fool**
IBM was once worth more than Microsoft, but today Microsoft is the world's third-most valuable company with a market cap of $3.18 trillion. IBM's market cap is $214 billion. The two companies adopted different strategies over the past 13 years. IBM focused on cost-cutting and buybacks, but neglected the growing cloud-infrastructure market. Microsoft, under CEO Satya Nadella, adopted a 'mobile first, cloud first' mantra, expanding its cloud services and launching new hardware devices. Microsoft's strategy paid off, with its revenue growing at a 11% CAGR and EPS growing at a 16% CAGR from 2014 to 2024. IBM's revenue declined at a negative 6% CAGR and EPS shrank at a negative 9% CAGR from 2021 to 2023. However, under new CEO Arvind Krishna, IBM's revenue grew at a 4% CAGR and EPS increased at a 13% CAGR. Analysts expect IBM's revenue and EPS to grow at a 4% and 7% CAGR from 2023 to 2026, while Microsoft's revenue and EPS are expected to grow at a 14% and 15% CAGR from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027. Assuming IBM matches expectations, its stock might rise 80% and boost its market cap to $370 billion by 2035. However, if Microsoft also matches estimates, its stock price could double and drive its market cap to nearly $6.4 trillion by 2035, making IBM still less valuable than Microsoft.

**Microsoft to consider bitcoin investment in December, despite board opposition**
Microsoft, valued at over $3 trillion, is considering investing in bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, according to a new SEC filing. The company will vote on the proposal at its December annual meeting, despite opposition from its Board of Directors, who claim it is 'unnecessary' as management has already evaluated the option. The Board stated that volatility is a factor to consider in evaluating cryptocurrency investments, and that Microsoft has strong processes in place to manage its corporate treasury. Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, offered advice to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, saying 'If you want to make the next trillion dollars for [Microsoft] shareholders, call me.' Shareholders like Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street will be eligible to vote on the proposal in December.

**If Microsoft Invests in Bitcoin It Will Be Likely Via Spot ETFs**
Microsoft is considering investing in Bitcoin, with a proposal to be voted on by shareholders in December. Although the company's board recommends voting against the proposal, the management has stated that they 'already carefully consider' investing in Bitcoin. If Microsoft were to invest in Bitcoin, it would be a historic milestone, given its market capitalization of $3.208 trillion. Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, has reached out to Microsoft's Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella to discuss the possibility. Saylor believes that Microsoft may prefer to invest in Bitcoin through spot ETFs, such as those offered by BlackRock, rather than holding actual BTC on their balance sheet. Regardless, the article concludes that Bitcoin is now too large to ignore, even for the biggest companies in the world.

**The Race to a $4 Trillion Market Cap: Apple, Nvidia, or Microsoft**
Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft are the top three companies in the world by market cap, with Apple sitting at $3.6 trillion. Nvidia's market cap is just above $3.5 trillion, thanks to its essential role in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, while Microsoft's market cap is at $3.1 trillion. Apple's AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence, were unveiled at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, but were not ready for the iPhone 16 launch in September. Apple Intelligence will be available on newer iPhones, but hundreds of millions of iPhone owners will need to upgrade their devices to access it. Analyst Dan Ives predicts a 'super cycle' driven by AI interest, which could lead to record iPhone sales of 240 million in fiscal 2025. A stronger-than-expected upgrade cycle and progress toward direct monetization of AI features could propel Apple's stock to the $4 trillion level, but it needs to outperform single-digit percentage revenue growth expectations for next year to justify a $4 trillion valuation.

**Which market cap is right for you: Large-cap, mid-cap, or small-cap stocks?**
When investing in stocks, understanding market cap is crucial in determining the right choice for you. Large-cap stocks ($10 billion+), like Apple and Microsoft, offer stability and regular dividends but slower growth. Mid-cap stocks ($2 billion-$10 billion) have higher growth potential but come with more volatility. Small-cap stocks (<$2 billion) offer the highest growth potential but with increased risk. Consider your risk tolerance, financial goals, and time horizon when choosing between large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks. Diversifying across market caps can help manage risk and enhance returns. A well-balanced portfolio might include a mix of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks to ensure both stability and growth potential.

He estimates iPhone units will exceed 240 million this year.

Microsoft, the largest company in the world by market capitalization, is a key holding of Bill Gates' portfolio.

Microsoft's cloud services division generated $36.8 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, a 21% year-over-year increase. Analysts expect the company's Azure OpenAI service to gain 60% more clients, and Mizuho has maintained a positive outlook on MSFT stock with a $480 price target. Microsoft remains a growth stock to own long-term, with a significant market premium, but its valuation may become more appropriate for value-conscious investors over time.
