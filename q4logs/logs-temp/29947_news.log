**US STOCKS-Futures slip as markets await inflation data for clues on...**
U.S. stock index futures fell on Wednesday as Treasury yields rose, ahead of crucial inflation data that will provide clues on the Federal Reserve's interest rate reductions. The Dow, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq futures were down 0.14%, 0.14%, and 0.13%, respectively. Economists predict core inflation to rise 0.3% and the headline number to increase 0.2% on a monthly basis. Investors see a 66% chance of a 25-basis point interest rate cut at the Fed's December meeting. Rate-sensitive megacap stocks, such as Meta Platforms and Microsoft, were lower in premarket trading, while Tesla gained 2.6% after closing down 6.2% in the previous session. The S&amp;P 500 has gained about 3.5% since the close on Nov. 5, and is on track for year-to-date gains of more than 25%.

**Stock Market Today: Dow futures fall as traders eye CPI inflation data**
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 futures are down 0.2%, 0.1%, and 0.1% respectively, indicating a cautious start to equity trading on Wall Street. The post-election rally has run out of steam, with the S&P 500 up 3.5% from the election day close. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said, 'U.S. markets tapped on the brakes after a blistering post-election rally which propelled each of the main indices to record highs.' The increase in implied borrowing costs is due to concerns that the incoming Trump administration's policies may stoke inflationary pressures. The U.S. consumer price index report for October will be the main focus, and any sign of building inflationary pressures may reduce the chances of another 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve in December.

**Dow, S&P 500 Futures Falling After Hitting Record Highs**
U.S. stock futures are falling early Tuesday after the S&P 500 closed above 6,000 for the first time yesterday. The index is on course for its first back-to-back yearly gains of more than 20% since 1998. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are down 35 points, or 0.1%, after closing above 44,000 for the first time yesterday. The market is optimistic about lower taxes and looser regulation under Donald Trump's presidency, which is expected to boost company earnings over the next four years. With two months to go before Trump takes office, the market is already responding to his anticipated plans, as well as data and earnings such as inflation figures and Home Depot earnings out this week.

**S&P 500 Forecast: Can Bulls Maintain Momentum Ahead of Wednesday's CPI Data?**
Stock futures rose on Monday as Wall Street sought to build on last week's gains, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at all-time highs. The Dow surged above the 44,000 level for the first time, and the S&P 500 had its best week in nearly a year, driven by renewed investor confidence after the presidential election outcome. The rally spread broadly across sectors, with the Nasdaq and the small-cap-focused Russell 2000 also advancing. According to the article, the market is looking to maintain momentum ahead of Wednesday's CPI data.

**S&P 500 has bullish November-December seasonality: BofA By Investing.com**
Bank of America strategists believe that the S&P 500 index has a 'bullish November-December seasonality', historically performing well in those two months, particularly in election years. The index has risen 62% of the time in November with an average return of 0.96%, and 74% of the time in December with an average return of 1.32%. They also noted that if the S&P 500 is up year-to-date through October, it has historically continued to rise 79% of the time in the November-December period, with average and median returns of 4.00% and 4.27%, respectively. Strategists emphasized that this pattern of strength is particularly pronounced in Presidential election years. From a technical analysis perspective, the SPX has maintained its tactical support within the bullish trend, and needs to regain its October highs in the 5870s to continue the bullish trend. 'If the SPX struggles below the October highs, the risk would increase for a retest of the cup and handle breakout zone in the 5600s with the rising 50-day moving average (MA) near 5688,' strategists wrote. In terms of market sentiment, individual investor survey signals a decline in bullishness, but not yet bearishness, as indicated by the still positive Bulls versus Bears spread.

**S&P 500: This Seasonal MACD Buy Signal Points to a Strong Year-End Rally | Investing.com**
The S&P 500 index has triggered its seasonal MACD buy signal, marking the beginning of a historically strong period for the stock market. This signal, combined with Yale Hirsch's research on market seasonality, suggests that investors may want to consider increasing exposure to equities, particularly in large-cap stocks. However, it's essential to recognize that while the MACD signal aligns with historical trends, it does not guarantee future performance. Analysts have lowered earnings estimates, but this could lead to a high 'beat rate' by companies, fueling stock prices in the short term. Additionally, corporate share buyback windows will reopen in November and December, with nearly $1 Trillion in authorizations for 2024. As noted by Goldman Sachs, the pace of buybacks will be exceptionally strong this year, providing sufficient buying power to lift asset prices into year-end. However, the technical backdrop also poses near-term risks, with the market deviating well above MONTHLY moving averages and overbought, a correction or consolidation is becoming increasingly likely before the year-end advance can take shape.

**Here's something for the bulls to celebrate over the next 10 weeks**
Historical data suggests that if the S & P 500 ends October with a six-month trailing return above 10%, it will likely finish December higher than where it ended October. Since 1950, there have been 12 instances where the S & P 500 met this criteria, and in every case, the index gained an average of 7.4% in November and December. Steve Deppe of Nerad + Deppe Wealth Management notes that while the market is near all-time highs and has had an unusually strong first three quarters, the data suggests that discipline with an investment strategy is more appropriate than acting on emotional bias. Deppe expects the S & P 500 to finish 2024 above 6,000, which would leave around 3% more upside from its current level. He also believes that the market could continue rallying into the first half of 2025, but may 'run out of gas' next summer. 'Right now, I think we have a mostly goldilocks environment from a price action standpoint,' Deppe said, 'which would lead me to believe that the fundamental state is probably going to be better than we all think moving forward.'

**UBS Predicts S&P 500 to Reach 6,400 by End of 2025**
UBS predicts that the S&P 500 will reach 6,400 by the end of 2025. Strategist Jonathan Golub has raised his target for the S&P 500 to 6,400 from 6,000 in a note to clients published on Tuesday. The new forecast implies a 9.2% increase from the closing price on Monday. Golub cited 'economic support' as the catalyst for the change. 'UBS economists predict a nominal GDP of 3.7% in 2025 (1.6% real), approximately in line with long-term averages,' he said. Additionally, 'rate cuts should reduce interest expenses and default risk, adding to both earnings per share and valuations.' Golub's call comes a day after the S&P 500 reached a new record, with its year-to-date gains reaching nearly 23%. Stocks have been on a roll recently, as investors see more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve on the horizon. 'Valuations tend to expand when the Fed cuts rates in non-recessionary environments,' said the strategist. 'Despite high valuations, we expect P/Es to increase [half] a point additional.' Golub also noted that a 'strong drop in Fed Funds would likely increase profit margins by 20 basis points through lower interest expenses.' A basis point is 1/100 of a percent, or 0.01%. The FedWatch tool from CME Group shows that operators of futures contracts for federal funds at 30 days see an 88% probability of a quarter-point rate cut in November, followed by an additional reduction of 25 basis points in December. The Fed lowered its federal funds rate target by half a point, to a range of 4.75% to 5.00%, in September. Golub does not see the stock market making further gains for the rest of this year. Although he increased his estimate for 2024 in the benchmark index to 5,850 from 5,600, that actually signals a slight decline from current levels.

**S&P 500 to hit 'well north' of 6,000 by the end of 2024 amid stock FOMO: Goldman By Investing.com**
The S&P 500 has seen a remarkable surge, up 42.3% from its low on October 27, 2023, and has hit 46 new all-time highs in 2024. Strategists at Goldman Sachs believe that the index could be 'well north of 6K by the end of the year' due to the fear of underperforming benchmark equity indices, referred to as 'FOMU.' This sentiment is driving institutional investors to take on more aggressive positions, with US corporates expected to inject approximately $6 billion into the market daily until the year's end. Historically, the S&P 500 has seen a median return of +5.17% from October 15th to December 31st, which could suggest a year-end level of $6160 based on today's level, or $6270 in election years.

**UBS sees S&P 500 soaring to 6,400 by the end of 2025**
UBS strategist Jonathan Golub has raised his 2025 S & P 500 target to 6,400 from 6,000, implying a 9.2% upside from Monday's close. Golub points to a 'supportive' economic backdrop, including 3.7% nominal GDP in 2025 and rate cuts, as a catalyst for the change. He expects valuations to rise despite elevated levels, and a 'sharp decline in Fed Funds will likely increase profit margins by 20 basis points via lower interest expense.' The CME Group's FedWatch tool shows traders see an 88% chance of a quarter percentage point rate cut in November, followed by an additional 25 basis-point reduction in December. Golub doesn't see the stock market making further gains the rest of this year, and instead expects stocks to consolidate before scaling new heights in the new year.

**The S&P 500 Just Did Something for the 1st Time This Century. History Says the Stock Market Will Do This Next.**
The S&P 500 has seen a 20.8% increase in the first three quarters of 2024, with Nvidia accounting for nearly one-quarter of the gains. This is the first time in the 21st century the S&P 500 has returned at least 20% through the first three quarters. According to history, the index could see even higher gains in the fourth quarter, with a median return of 31% in years where the index has gained at least 20% through the first three quarters. This would put the S&P 500 at 6,249 by December 31, implying nearly 9% upside in the remaining weeks of the fourth quarter. However, investor sentiment and macroeconomic data will play a significant role in determining the stock market's performance in the coming weeks. Many stocks in the S&P 500 trade at historically expensive valuations, and several important data points will be announced later this month, including the Consumer Price Index report and job openings. The S&P 500 currently trades at 26.7 times earnings, a premium to the five-year average and the 10-year average. Wall Street strategists expect the S&P 500 to decline modestly in the weeks ahead, with a median year-end target of 5,600, implying 3% downside from its current level.

**September's Positive Trend Expected to Continue**
September has been an unusual month for the stock market, with the S&P 500 index rising by 2%. According to Josephine Cetti, chief strategist at Nordea, this positive trend is expected to continue in the coming months, despite some risk factors. The recent positive numbers, including a 0.5% decrease in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, have helped to boost optimism in the market. The tech sector has also made a comeback, which has contributed to the overall positive trend. Cetti notes that the large tech companies have a significant impact on the market, and when they perform well, they can pull the market up with them. The S&P 500 index has risen by 20% so far this year, and Cetti expects this trend to continue. However, there are still some risks to consider, including the upcoming US presidential election and ongoing geopolitical tensions. Cetti believes that the overall picture for the stock market in 2024 is positive, with inflation on the decline and economic growth on the rise. She also expects the 'Santa Claus Rally' to occur in November and December, which is a period of increased risk-taking and buying of underperforming stocks. 'We expect this to happen again this year,' Cetti says.

**SP500: The Q3 Topping Process Could Turn Into The Q4 Bubble Burst**
The S&P 500 Index is currently trading at a high P/E ratio of around 24, significantly overvalued by historical standards. Analysts expect a 14.3% earnings growth in 2025, but many indicators point to a recession in 2025, which would typically lead to negative earnings growth. The S&P 500 is entering Q4 2024 with a high valuation, overly optimistic earnings growth expectations, and a recession looming. The market's volatility has increased, with the S&P VIX Index rising 40% in Q3. The author believes the S&P 500 is in the topping process, with three peaks in Q3, and the current peak could be the top. The Q4 preview is uncertain, with the US election in November being a key variable. The author expects the economic data to deteriorate after the election, and the geopolitical situation to escalate. The Fed is likely to cut interest rates in November and December, which could signal a recession and cause a major selloff in the S&P 500. The Gen AI bubble burst is also a risk, with the author expecting a sharp selloff if there are earnings misses or guidance revisions from Gen AI mega-caps. The 2024 Q4 is particularly risky due to the uncertainties with the US election and the escalating geopolitical situation, and investors are advised to reduce their exposure to the stock market, especially those close to retirement.

**Brief Event-Driven: Prosus X Naspers: Discounts Catch Bid on China Stimulus, Trip.com Stake Fully Exited and more**
Prosus and Naspers' discounts have rallied on China's fresh stimulus measures, targeting the stock market and property sector. The PBoC reduced the main policy rate and cut the RRR, signaling further cuts for later this year. Additionally, the S&P 500 index is expected to undergo two regular changes in December 2024, with several live spin-off and M&A events potentially triggering intra-review index changes. The Korea Value-Up Index may undergo a special rebalancing in December 2024, with a high probability of 85%+, and KB Financial, Hana Financial, Samsung Life Insurance, SK Telecom, and KT being top candidates for inclusion. The SET50 index is also expected to undergo 3 changes in December 2024, with minor tweaks possible due to the 3-month reference period used for average market cap rankings. KRX faces challenges balancing the Value-Up Index as a benchmark while ensuring real disclosures, but passive inflows remain steady with local pension funds still interested.

Stocks are climbing on carryover support from a +4% surge in Chinese stocks after China announced additional stimulus measures.

As a result, Alcoa is up more than +7%. ECB Governing Council member Muller said ECB policymakers may lack sufficient data to make a decision on interest rates in October, but 'It will be easier to decide in December because then we'll have a full picture with an updated outlook.'

**Fed Takes Bold Move to Avoid Recession, Markets React Positively**
The Federal Reserve decided to take a bold move on Wednesday, September 18, by lowering its interest rates by half a point, to 4.75-5%. Two additional 25-point base interventions are planned for November and December, which should result in a total of 100 points of base easing in 2024, followed by another 100 points in 2025. The central bank's strategy is to act decisively now and then more moderately, in order to avoid a recession in the United States. Investors seemed convinced that this was the right approach, as the S&P 500 index rose 1.7% the next day, and the CAC 40 index rose 2.3%, erasing its losses since the beginning of the year.
