**D-FW home sellers may lack upper hand for first time in years in topsy-turvy market**
For the first time in years, home sellers in Dallas-Fort Worth may lack a strong upper hand due to rising inventory and fading competition among buyers. However, mortgage rates are approaching 7% again, which may define the remainder of 2024 and could impact the market in 2025. According to Shriram Villupuram, a real estate and finance professor at the University of Texas at Arlington, 'The weird factor comes in because, when interest rates go up and affordability goes down, prices should go down, but we’re not a normal market.' Despite this, Villupuram believes the market still favors sellers, but notes that mortgage rates are 'flattening the home price.' The median price of a D-FW home was $399,000 in October, up 2.5% from last year, and there were more than 30,200 active listings, a 37% jump from last year. Experts generally consider an inventory of five or six months as balanced between buyers and sellers, and there are currently 4.1 months of housing inventory in D-FW.

**Here's what the housing market will look like in 2025**
Zillow predicts a more active housing market in 2025 with more inventory and modest home value growth. According to Skylar Olsen, Zillow's chief economist, 'Buying a home in 2024 was surprisingly competitive given how high the affordability hurdle became. More inventory should shake loose in 2025, giving buyers a bit more room to breathe.' Zillow forecasts a 2.6% home value growth in 2025, with 4.3 million existing home sales. However, mortgage rates are expected to be volatile, with potential swings throughout the year. Additionally, Americans are shifting towards smaller homes and renting as a long-term lifestyle, with the term 'cozy' appearing in 35% more listing descriptions in 2024 compared to 2023.

**US Housing Market May Be the Best Time to Buy in Five Years**
According to a recent article on realtor.com, the current housing market in the US may be the best time to buy a house in five years. Despite high interest rates and limited housing supply, the market is showing signs of balance, with more inventory available and prices stabilizing. The article cites data from Redfin, which shows that new listings have increased by 15.3% in Washington D.C., 15.1% in San Francisco, and 14.3% in Seattle compared to last year. These cities, along with New York and Baltimore, are experiencing a surge in new listings, which is expected to continue into the new year. However, some cities, such as Austin, Texas, and Atlanta, are experiencing a decline in new listings. The article also highlights the four main reasons for the lack of new housing construction in the US: high land costs, labor shortages, excessive regulations, and 'not-in-my-backyard' (NIMBY) attitudes. The author suggests that the incoming administration's policies may have a complex impact on the housing market, with both positive and negative effects.

**This housing market map shows Zillow's revised 2025 home price forecast**
Zillow economists have revised their 2025 home price forecast, predicting a 2.9% increase in U.S. home prices between October 2024 and October 2025. According to Zillow economists, opposing forces are working to keep home values climbing, but only at a modest pace. They expect a gradual increase in existing home sales in the coming year, with an estimated 4.3 million sales in 2025, up slightly from 4.1 million transactions recorded in 2023 and 4 million projected for 2024. Zillow economists wrote, 'This is an upward revision to our outlook from last month. Opposing forces are working to keep home values climbing, but only at a modest pace.'

**This housing market map shows Zillow’s revised 2025 home price forecast**
Zillow economists have revised their 2025 home price forecast, expecting a 2.9% increase in U.S. home prices between October 2024 and October 2025. They attribute this growth to low inventory, declining mortgage rates, and modest improvements in home sales indicators. However, they also note that modest increases in new listings and high mortgage rates will limit price growth. Zillow expects the strongest home price appreciation to occur in 10 areas, including Atlantic City, NJ (+6.5%), and the weakest in 10 areas, including Lake Charles, LA (-7.8%). Some housing analysts remain skeptical about Florida's housing market, citing increased inventory and declining condo prices.

**Dallas Real Estate Market Transitions to More Balanced Market in 2024**
The Dallas real estate market is transitioning from a seller's market to a more balanced market in 2024. This change is driven by several factors, including an increase in housing supply, a moderate slowdown in price growth, and ongoing economic factors. Several factors are influencing the current market trend: interest rates, economic uncertainty, population growth, and a strong job market. The market is now exhibiting characteristics of both a buyer's market and a seller's market. The buyer's market features increased inventory, fewer bidding wars, and slightly lower prices. The seller's market is supported by a strong job market and ongoing population growth, as well as relatively low inventory levels. The market's specific characteristics vary depending on the sub-area and location. It is recommended to conduct a detailed analysis of the specific area and price range of interest and consult with local real estate professionals for the latest market information. Different price ranges have different sales data, with the low price range (under $150,000) showing significant fluctuations, the mid-range ( $250,000 to $400,000) remaining the most active market, and the high-end market (over $750,000) showing a decrease in median price despite an increase in sales volume. Inventory months increase with price range, with high-end properties staying on the market longer. The average sales time for Dallas homes increased to 86 days in September 2024, up from 76 days in September 2023. In summary, the Dallas real estate market is undergoing a transformative phase, transitioning from a strong seller's market to a more balanced market. Inventory is increasing, and prices are showing a moderate slowdown, providing opportunities for buyers and sellers to participate in the market with more strategy. The Dallas economy remains strong, with a stable job market and ongoing population growth supporting the real estate market. However, buyers and sellers need to be aware of various factors influencing the market, including interest rates, economic uncertainty, and new home construction.

**Home sales jumped in October, and housing demand is set to pick up from here, NAR says**
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported a 3.4% increase in existing home sales in October, marking the first annual rise since July 2021. The group attributed the increase to more inventory of existing homes coming to market, giving prospective buyers more opportunities to purchase. However, buyers are still challenged by affordability issues, with the median existing home price climbing 4% to $407,200 in October, marking the 16th-straight month of price increases. Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, stated, 'The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions.' Despite elevated mortgage rates, Yun expects them to stabilize. Real estate forecasters anticipate the housing market to remain tight in 2025, with Zillow predicting a 2.8% increase in home prices over the next 12 months and Bank of America analysts anticipating a 5% rise next year.

**Competition for homes is easing the fastest for buyers in these markets**
The National Association of Realtors' new real estate settlement rules are set to go into effect on August 17, which could impact the housing market. According to Zillow, competition among buyers is easing, with inventory slowly building back up and price cuts becoming more common. This trend is most pronounced in Texas, Florida, and the New Orleans metro, where buyers currently have an edge in negotiations. Zillow's chief economist, Skylar Olsen, stated, 'We're seeing competition among buyers fade, with mortgage rates climbing back toward 7% as we move closer to the usual winter slowdown.' Olsen added, 'Inventory is still slowly building back up and price cuts are still relatively common — persistent buyers may be able to find a deal or negotiate for worthwhile concessions.' As a result, reduced competition is leading to softer home value appreciation, with the largest monthly drops in home values found in Austin, Dallas, Atlanta, Tampa, and San Antonio.

**US Housing Market Continues to Show Upward Trend**
The US housing market continues to show an upward trend, with prices increasing 0.5% in October, according to a report by Redfin. The report states that the low inventory of houses and the expected decrease in mortgage interest rates are driving the price increase. Redfin's senior economist Sheharyar Bokhari said, 'Many people, especially first-time homebuyers, have been waiting for the election to end before making a decision to buy a house. Now that the election is over, we're seeing a rebound in homebuying demand, and in the next few months, we expect to see even more competition for homes, unless the number of available homes increases significantly, in which case, home prices may continue to rise.' Zillow's recent report predicts that home prices will increase by 2.6% this year and 2.8% in the next 12 months. The report attributes the price increase to low inventory and the expected decrease in mortgage interest rates. However, if mortgage interest rates rise and inventory increases slightly, it may limit the price increase.

**Cities with highest share of affordable home listings: How Denver compares**
A recent analysis by Zillow found that the share of affordable homes in the US has increased to 28% in September, the highest level since February 2023. However, this relief may be short-lived as mortgage rates have ticked up again, with the average 30-year mortgage rate at 6.78% last week. According to Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist for Zillow, 'Buyers should expect more ups and downs ahead for mortgage rates.' The share of affordable homes varies from market to market, with Austin, Texas seeing the biggest rise in affordable listings, increasing from 13% in October 2023 to 26% in October 2024. In Denver, 22.9% of home listings in October 2024 were considered affordable, slightly down from September 2024's 23%. Meanwhile, large markets in California and the Northeast are among the least affordable in the country.

**Housing Competition Decreases in Texas and Florida, Buyers Gain Advantage**
The competition for housing in the US is decreasing, particularly in Texas and Florida, where inventories are recovering from historic lows since the pandemic, according to the latest market report from Zillow. The Zillow Market Heat Index indicates that the competition nationwide is approaching a buyer's market, as activity slows down for the winter. However, Dallas, Houston, and Miami are among the top 10 most expensive cities in the US, according to Zillow's price indices. 'We're seeing the competition between buyers fade away, with mortgage rates rising back to 7% as we approach the typical winter slowdown,' said Skylar Olsen, Zillow's chief economist. The inventory is still slowly accumulating, and price cuts are still relatively common - persistent buyers can find a deal or negotiate concessions worth the effort, Olsen added. The seasonal trends in inventory are local, and decisions to move by buyers and sellers may not be as hindered by the winter time in Southern states, for example. With the current persistence of high housing prices and the mortgage environment, the competition between buyers has a lot to do with the available inventory. Each of the 13 major markets where buyers currently have an advantage are among the top 20 nationally in terms of inventory recovery compared to pre-pandemic levels. The reduced competition translates to lower home appreciation. Monthly home value declines are greater in Austin, Dallas, Atlanta, Tampa, and San Antonio. The average number of days an ad stays on the market has increased more in Southern markets compared to before the pandemic. The national inventory is still on a long path of recovery from a deficit that developed at the beginning of the pandemic; it now sits approximately 28% below pre-pandemic norms for this time of year, the smallest deficit since September 2020 and a significant improvement from the 36% deficit recorded in March, the lowest of 2024. New construction is another piece of the puzzle. In cases where builders have been able to keep up with demand, the balance is returning to markets, and home price appreciation and rent growth have generally flattened. The relief from lower mortgage rates in September was brief. The relief that homebuyers felt in September due to the drop in mortgage rates was brief. Mortgage rates rose again in October, returning some of the gains in affordability. Mortgage payments for a typical home increased by 2.8% intermonthly in October, after four consecutive months of declines. However, monthly mortgage payments (with a 20% down payment) have decreased by more than $100 per month compared to the May peak and are $179 less than in October last year.'

**Competition for homes easing fastest in Florida, Texas - Zillow Gr (NASDAQ:Z), Zillow Gr (NASDAQ:ZG)**
According to Zillow's market report, competition for homes is easing across the nation, with more markets tilting in favor of buyers. The report shows that sold homes are typically on the market for 23 days before selling, a week faster than last year. Mortgage rates have risen, giving back some affordability gains, with monthly mortgage costs increasing by 2.8% over September. However, monthly mortgage payments are still down more than $100 per month compared to the peak in May and are $179 less than in October of last year. Zillow's market heat index indicates that competition nationwide is creeping closer to becoming a buyers market as activity winds down for the winter. Skylar Olsen, Zillow chief economist, said, 'We're seeing competition among buyers fade, with mortgage rates climbing back toward 7% as we move closer to the usual winter slowdown.' The report also notes that new construction and recovering inventory are helping shift markets in favor of buyers, particularly in Southern states such as Texas and Florida.

**Today’s Mortgage Rates Increase: November 19, 2024 Analysis**
Mortgage rates have increased recently, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate reaching 6.60% as of November 19, 2024. This rise is attributed to the strengthening economy, particularly in the labor market, which has placed upward pressure on interest rates. Despite expectations that rates might ease in 2025, many experts are cautious, citing the robust job market and high consumer spending. Homebuyers and those looking to refinance should consider their unique financial situations and weigh the costs and benefits of refinancing, as current rates are higher than previous months. According to Zillow, average rates for various mortgage types include: 30-year fixed: 6.63%, 15-year fixed: 6.06%, 30-year FHA: 5.73%, 30-year VA: 6.03%, and 7/1 ARM: 7.20%.

**Higher mortgage rates keep the market subdued even as more sellers list their homes**
Higher mortgage rates are continuing to impact the housing market, with the average 30-year conforming rate reaching 6.61% on Tuesday, a 15 basis point increase from the previous week. Despite this, more sellers are listing their homes, with single-family home inventory up 33% from last year. However, new pending sales are also on the rise, with a 9% increase from the same week last year and an 11% increase from the same week in 2022. Mike Simonsen, founder of Altos Research, notes that the market is 'slowly adjusting to this new normal of higher mortgage rates.' Homebuilders are also facing challenges due to the cost of borrowing, with HousingWire Lead Analyst Logan Mohtashami stating that the current policy rate range is 'recessionary levels for housing permits.' Zillow data shows that housing starts were down for a second straight year in 2023, but builders have pivoted toward condominiums and townhomes to create more starter-home supply at lower price points. Home-price appreciation continues to hamper affordability, with prices rising 0.5% from August to September and 6% on a yearly basis.

**Contractors building fewer single-family homes and more townhouses**
Home builders are constructing more townhouses and fewer single-family homes, according to the latest analysis from Zillow. In 2023, approximately 1 million homes were completed, an 11% increase from 2019. However, construction starts for detached single-family homes fell by nearly 9% from 2022 to 2023, while starts for attached single-family homes increased by over 3%. Orphe Divounguy, Zillow's senior economist, said, 'The housing affordability crisis continues to affect America, stemming from decades of underbuilding.' He emphasized the importance of increasing supply and promoting density through local legislation to provide affordable homes. The median size of a new home is still around 2,200 square feet, but the median lot area has decreased by 700 square feet compared to 2022. The markets issuing the most single-family permits since 2020 include Houston, Dallas, and Phoenix, which are expected to see improvements in housing affordability due to population growth.

**Builders Continue Shift to Condos and Townhomes amidst Affordability Crisis**
The US housing market continues to grow, with 1 million single-family homes completed in 2023, a 11% increase from 2019. Builders are shifting towards higher density, building more townhomes and attached homes to address the affordability crisis. According to Orphe Divounguy, Zillow senior economist, 'The best long-term solution is more supply. Builders are helping where they can by shifting to more cost-conscious and space-efficient designs. But promoting density through local laws is key — that will go a long way to bring in more affordable homes where they’re needed the most.' The pace of construction is slowing, but markets like Houston, Dallas, and Phoenix are seeing significant growth in single-family permits. Markets with faster jobs and income growth tend to see larger increases in new construction activity.

For example, Tallawong, Blaxlands Ridge, and Kurraba Point in Sydney saw a 63%, 42%, and 40% increase in searches, respectively. In Melbourne, Koo Wee Rup, Dallas, and Lang Lang East saw a 112%, 48%, and 44% increase in searches. As the population continues to grow and rental supply remains tight, demand for housing is likely to remain elevated in the near term. An anticipated interest rate decline in early next year is expected to further boost demand, leading to an even greater increase in search activity from prospective buyers.

**Dallas Housing Market Forecast**
The Dallas-Fort Worth housing market has seen improvements in housing supply and buyer interest, with a 20% increase in newly approved construction permits for single-family homes and a 1.2% decrease in median home price year over year to $425,000. Todd Luong, a real estate agent, says the market is still a seller's market, but it feels balanced due to the recent drop in home prices and increased inventory. The rental market has also seen price increases, with the average rent around $2,025 in the Dallas market in September. Unemployment trends in the Dallas market are positive, with an unemployment rate of 4.1% in August 2024 and a 142,000 increase in nonfarm payroll employment. Luong believes the market will see a typical slowdown into the fall and winter, but is optimistic about the future, saying 'Dallas has always been in a bull market, it feels. Since 2014, prices have gone up every year. Things are finally stabilizing now, which is great because buyers can take a more relaxed approach.'

**Residential Real Estate Investors Take A Pause: What Will Bring Them Back To The Market?**
Despite rising market prices, real estate investors have slowed their buying activity, according to a recent report from CoreLogic. In June 2024, investors made up 23.4% of the market, the lowest seen in two years. However, this is still above pre-pandemic levels. Investors may return to the market with mortgage rates hitting lows not seen in two years. Small investors make up around 18% of the market, while large institutional landlords make up a small share. The city with the most massive investors is Atlanta, where they purchase 5% of all homes. The fast-growing Texas towns of Dallas and Houston are the top spots for both investor and non-investor purchases. 'There also seems to be little chance of prices falling substantially shortly, so buyer demand will likely remain low while rental demand will remain high,' wrote CoreLogic economist Thomas Malone. The Sunbelt remains a top spot for investors, with the top 10 best markets for investors all in the South. Investors may face increased competition if mortgage rates cause buyers to flood into these and other markets.
