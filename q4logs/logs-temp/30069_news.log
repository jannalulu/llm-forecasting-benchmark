**4 Kenyan counties at alert drought phase with risk of starvation**
Four counties in Kenya's arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL) have transitioned to the 'alert' drought phase, putting about a million people at risk of starvation, according to the National Drought Management Authority (NDMA). The agency noted that the situation is worsening across most of the ASAL counties due to the delayed onset of the October to December season. Additionally, acute malnutrition has been reported across the counties, with 479,498 children and 110,169 pregnant and breastfeeding mothers in need of treatment. The four counties at the alert phase of drought are Garissa, Kilifi, Kwale, and Tana River, while counties with cases of malnutrition include Baringo, Turkana, Kitui, Laikipia, Lamu, Makueni, and West Pokot. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development reported that the number of food-insecure people in the Horn of Africa stands at 67 million.

**More than 390 incidents attended due to rains in the country**
Since October 31, when the National System for Civil Protection (Sinaproc) issued the first alert, at least 393 situations have been attended to due to the country's weather conditions. Landslides lead the list of incidents, with 202 reports, followed by 81 floods and 73 fallen trees. Roads affected, bridge collapses, and rescue operations have been part of the actions taken in recent days as a result of these events, which have already claimed the lives of eight people. According to Minister of Government Dinoska Montalvo, 'November has rained more in the first four days than it should have rained throughout the entire month.' Montalvo expressed her concern about the saturation of soils, which, combined with human intervention, has affected areas near rivers, modifying the reality and geography of the country. She added that 'this year we only have the capacity for reaction,' but a national plan for risk mitigation against disasters is expected to be implemented in 2025. For now, 'these alerts aim to safeguard the lives of citizens. If the population follows the instructions at the right time, it will help us greatly,' Montalvo said in a press conference where she presented the balance of the damage caused by the rains. 'We remain on yellow alert at the national level, but we are carrying out all the corresponding operations for a red alert, as the weather situation will persist until the first weeks of December,' she added.

**US Experiences Worst Drought in 25 Years**
The United States is experiencing its worst drought in 25 years, affecting all states except Alaska and Kentucky. Approximately 257 million Americans are under a severe drought warning. Many states have asked residents to reduce their water usage by limiting shower times, not watering their gardens, and reducing water flow in toilets to conserve resources. The situation was severe in Pennsylvania, leading to the drying up of a lake and the exposure of a 200-year-old bridge's remains. The hardest-hit areas include Texas, Ohio, West Virginia, Wyoming, Montana, and Missouri, all of which are facing extreme or exceptional drought conditions after no rainfall since September. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has described the event as a 'sudden drought' caused by below-average rainfall, above-average temperatures, and strong winds. According to the Southeast Regional Climate Center, at least 100 weather stations across the US recorded no precipitation in October. The drought is affecting major cities like Philadelphia, Atlanta, Birmingham, Dallas, Las Vegas, and Sacramento. The drought has persisted even in states like North Carolina and Georgia, which were hit by Hurricane Helen and experienced flooding of up to 15 feet in late September. NASA's Earth Observatory reported that many areas affected by the hurricane dried up quickly and have not seen any rainfall since the disaster. The drought has different levels, with D3 being severe, capable of halting crop and livestock production, increasing the severity of wildfires, and causing outbreaks of diseases like typhoid and cholera if people drink contaminated water. D4s is the most severe, causing widespread crop failure, severe water shortages, and potential environmental damage. Cities like New York City are also affected, with Mayor Eric Adams urging residents to conserve every drop of water by reducing the number of times they flush the toilet, taking shorter showers, and not letting water run while brushing their teeth. The warning comes as the city's water tanks in northern New York State are nearing depletion, with only a third of them filled, compared to the usual three-quarters at this time of year. The cotton industry has been severely affected by the drought, with the US expected to produce its second-lowest crop in a decade. Texas, the country's largest cotton producer, is expected to produce only 2.1 million acres of cotton this year, down from 5.5 million acres in 2022. Arkansas has also been affected, with many of its cornfields damaged.

**Entergy Arkansas reduces drawdown rate for Hamilton, Catherine due to summer drought**
Entergy Arkansas has reduced the drawdown rate for lakes Hamilton and Catherine due to the ongoing summer drought. The lakes are now dropping at a rate of approximately 3 inches per day instead of the standard 6 inches. According to Heather Kendrick, a communications specialist with Entergy Arkansas, the slower drawdown is necessary to conserve water in Lake Ouachita, which is in its annual refill period. Kendrick stated, 'By slowing down the drawdown release we reduce the need to draw water from Lake Ouachita for a few days to help conserve water there.' The drawdown is expected to reach its low point on Tuesday, and the annual refill period is expected to start around March 1, with full pool expected to be reached no later than March 15.

**US Election 2024: Severe Weather May Disrupt Voters in Key States**
According to USA Today, severe weather conditions, including thunderstorms and snow, may disrupt voters in key states in the US. A strong cold front is expected to hit the central part of the country, threatening the region with scattered rain and thunderstorms. States like Michigan and Wisconsin, which are crucial in the election, may experience strong winds and rain as the front moves east. Isolated severe storms are also possible in the upper regions of Texas to central Louisiana and southern Arkansas to western Mississippi. The National Weather Service has warned of a continued threat of tornadoes in parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, which could pose a risk to voters and polling stations. Despite this, over 82 million Americans have already cast their votes through early voting, either in person or by mail. The US electoral system is complex, with the president not elected directly by popular vote, but through the Electoral College, a compromise between congressional and popular vote. The Electoral College is not a place, but a process of selecting and gathering electors, who vote to choose the president and vice president. The electors' votes are counted by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and a candidate needs to secure a majority of 270 votes to win the presidency. Each state in the Electoral College is represented by the same number of electors as its members in Congress, with each member of the House of Representatives and each Senator representing their state. The District of Columbia is allocated three electors and is treated as a state in the Electoral College under the 23rd Amendment to the US Constitution.

**Months of drought conditions complicate winter feed strategies**
Arkansas' cattle producers will have to start feeding hay earlier and longer due to the state's prolonged drought. According to Kenny Simon, extension forage educator for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture, the drought has impacted the growth of fescue and delayed the planting of warm-season perennial grasses. Simon said, 'Everyone's scared to plant because of how dry it is.' As a result, bermudagrass will not be available for grazing until later than normal in spring. The state's fescue pastures are growing unusually sparse, and Simon recommends using moveable electric fence to 'strip graze' the remaining forage. James Mitchell, extension livestock economist, said that much of the U.S. cattle industry has been in a 'liquidation phase,' with producers culling herds for much of the last five years. However, many Arkansas producers were able to stockpile enough hay to get through at least a normal year, and Simon said, 'I think most folks got the hay they need for a normal year, but these fall droughts may force people to start feeding three to four weeks early.'

**Post-drought Arkansas agriculture industry still seeing long term effect**
Recent rain in Arkansas has had a mixed impact on the agriculture industry. While it has helped prevent wheat from drying out for cattle farmers, it has made harvests more difficult for row crop farmers. According to Henry Caldwell, the rain has kept wheat alive for when it is warm enough, but Johnathan Kubesch, a University of Arkansas extension specialist, notes that row crop farmers have a different opinion. The drought has already caused a switch from grazing, which normally waits until December, and the industry is hoping for a better year next year. As Caldwell said, 'A farmer, a cattleman, they always plan on next year being better, but don’t always (be) the case.' The University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture notes that droughts are expected to happen three out of every 10 years since the 1970s.

**Prompted by drought, burn bans persist despite recent rain**
Despite recent rain, dry conditions and outdoor burn bans persist in the River Valley. The Sebastian County Department of Emergency Management has extended the burn ban, citing the need for more precipitation and consistent moisture. The National Weather Service reports that drought conditions are expected to last through the end of January, with many farmers and producers in the area reporting signs of drought, including stressed mature trees, dry ponds, and cracked ground. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, about two-thirds of Sebastian County is at moderate drought status, while the rest is slightly better as it is considered abnormally dry. The region's drought has worsened in all of Northwest Arkansas except in Crawford County, where there was no change. The National Weather Service reports that the driest fall on record in Fort Smith is 1963, when just 3.07 inches of rain was recorded for all of September, October, and November. This fall, 2.21 inches of rain has been recorded as November starts, according to the National Weather Service.

**Arkansas businesses impacted by drought may apply for SBA loans**
Small businesses in seven Arkansas counties affected by the drought can apply for low-interest federal disaster loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The loans will help offset economic losses caused by the drought, which started on October 15. Eligible businesses can borrow up to $2 million to meet financial obligations and operating expenses. According to Francisco Sánchez Jr., associate administrator for the Office of Disaster Recovery and Resilience at the SBA, 'These loans are the backbone that helps rural communities bounce back and thrive after a disaster strikes.' The loans have an interest rate of 4% for businesses and 3.25% for private nonprofit organizations, a maximum term of 30 years, and interest does not begin to accrue until 12 months from the date of the loan. However, as of October 15, funds for the Disaster Loan Program have been expended, and no new loans can be issued until Congress appropriates additional funding.

**Arkansas crews battle hundreds of fires in October**
Arkansas Forestry Emergency Division officials report that crews have put out close to 300 fires in October, covering over 3000 acres. Emergency Services Director Robert Murphy stated that the dry weather has contributed to the number and intensity of the fires. Crews, consisting of around 200 field workers, use bulldozers and planes with water tankers to combat the fires, with the time it takes to extinguish them depending on the size and location of the fire. Murphy hopes that the forecasted rain will alleviate the drought, but notes that a single inch of rain may not be enough to make a significant difference. 'If we get the rain that we are forecast to get in the next couple of days with the drought we’re in it probably won’t be a drought buster, but it will depend.' Murphy said. 'An inch of rain doesn’t do a whole lot. We can get an inch of rain and if it turns right back like it is now, then in a week we will be right back in the same situation.'

**Prolonged drought could impact wildlife in the Natural State**
A spokesperson for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, Trey Reid, warned that a prolonged drought could impact wildlife in the state. According to Reid, a long-term drought could affect the distribution of animals, their travel routes, and food sources. Reid noted that the drought is currently not having a significant impact on the majority of wildlife, but the longer it lasts, the greater the impact could be. He also stated that the lack of rainfall and water could affect the number of ducks in the state this season, as the presence of rainfall and water in agricultural fields and river bottoms is a key determining factor of duck abundance in Arkansas. Reid expressed hope that the drought would come to an end soon, saying, 'I'd like to see some rain. I'm an avid duck hunter so I would like to see some rain before November 23.'

**Disaster loan deadline approaching in Arkansas for Small Business Administration working capital program**

The low-interest working capital loans are available to those whose businesses sustained physical damage, lost inventory, equipment, or revenue due to the drought beginning November 1, 2023. SBA associate administrator Francisco Sánchez said the loans, which can be up to $2 million, help meet working capital needs caused by the disaster. 'Economic Injury Disaster Loans may be used to pay fixed debts, payroll, accounts payable and other bills that cannot be paid because of the disaster’s impact,' Sánchez said. The interest rate is 4% for businesses and 3.25% for private nonprofit organizations with terms up to 30 years. However, loan availability is pending Congress replenishing the loan fund.

The drought in Northwest Arkansas has worsened since the last widespread rain on August 18th. Since then, only 0.84in of rain has fallen at Drake Field and 0.96in at the Ft. Smith Regional Airport. The drought monitor shows that conditions have only gotten worse, with barely any rain falling in the region. According to the article, 'drought is not the cause of fire, but it can add to the fuel for fire.' The dry conditions are also leading to low levels at Beaver Lake, which can be checked here. The article states that 'the drought has only gotten worse' since September 17th, with only 0.12in of rain falling at Drake Field and 0.85in in Ft. Smith. This is compared to the climatological average, where the region should be receiving more rain. The dry conditions are also contributing to strong fire weather ingredients, including low relative humidity.

**AST Weather Blog: Drought likely to worsen, enhancing wildfire danger and warmer temps**
The past several weeks have been extremely dry in Arkansas, with August and September falling short of their average rainfall by over an inch. So far in October, no significant rain has been seen. This has led to a rapid onset of drought conditions, enhancing the threat of wildfires. Most counties have issued burn bans, and a new drought monitor is expected to show no improvements. A warming trend is forecasted for next week, with temperatures potentially trending warmer in the afternoons. This is consistent with the typical fall weather pattern, which is usually the driest time of the year. Rainfall averages are expected to increase again through November and the following winter months.

**Farmers are balancing the challenges of harvest and hurricane season**
Farmers in the southern United States are nearing the end of the 2024 growing season, with some facing challenges from hurricanes. Matt Miles, a fourth-generation farmer in Arkansas, said, 'We've been fortunate to miss two hurricanes that normally would’ve hit us hard, though many others weren’t so lucky.' Despite the challenges, Miles is optimistic about yields, with his farm on track to hit its five-year average on cotton, corn, and soybeans. Chad Henderson, a fifth-generation farmer in Alabama, reported a successful corn harvest, with an average of 140 bushels an acre on dryland corn, despite a drought. Henderson is also preparing to plant wheat, with soil sampling and analysis underway to determine the fertilizer blend. 'We're hopeful they’ll turn out to be an average crop, thanks to some late-season rainfall,' Henderson said. 'We're never guaranteed tomorrow,' Miles added, reflecting on the devastating impact of hurricanes on farmers and communities.

**USDA Predicts 6% Decline in US Turkey Population in 2024**
According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the US turkey population is expected to decline by 6% in 2024, reaching 205 million heads. The report notes that only 4 of the 13 largest turkey-producing states will be able to maintain their population levels from the previous year. No state is expected to see an increase in production. The states that will be able to maintain their population levels are Indiana, Ohio, California, and West Virginia, which are not among the top turkey-producing states. In contrast, the largest turkey-producing state, Minnesota, is expected to see a 12% decline in population, from 38.5 million turkeys in 2023 to 33.5 million in 2024. North Carolina is expected to see a 5% decline, from 29 to 27.5 million heads, while Arkansas is expected to see a 7% decline, from 27 to 25 million heads. The largest decline is expected in South Dakota, where the population is expected to decline by 15%, to 2.8 million turkeys. The forecast was based on information provided by 296 turkey-producing enterprises.

**La Niña's Impact on the US Climate: NOAA's Updated Winter Forecast**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has updated its winter forecast for the 2024-2025 season, predicting that the La Niña phenomenon will have a significant impact on the climate in the United States. According to the NOAA, La Niña will influence the environmental conditions between December 2024 and February 2025, leading to increased humidity in the northern regions of the US and a drier-than-usual winter in the south. The agency predicts a 71% chance of La Niña manifesting between September and November, with effects potentially persisting until January, February, and even March. The NOAA also warns that the appearance of this climate event in moderate to strong levels during the fall is less likely, but still possible. The agency anticipates that neutral conditions will return by the end of the first quarter of next year, between February and April. The NOAA's forecast indicates that the south and east of the US are likely to experience above-normal temperatures this winter, with the Gulf Coast, the Southeast, and the Northeast being the most probable regions to experience warm temperatures. On the other hand, the northwest Pacific, the northern Rocky Mountains, and the Great Plains are expected to experience colder-than-normal temperatures and closer to historical values, affecting states such as Oregon, Washington, Montana, northern Idaho, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa. La Niña is also characterized by producing increased humidity in the north and reduced humidity in the south. Therefore, for this winter, the NOAA predicts that regions such as the northwest, the Great Lakes, and the Northeast could experience higher levels of precipitation. However, this projection does not guarantee significant snowfall. In contrast, the southwest, the central-south, and the southeast of the country could face drier-than-usual conditions, with the Rio Grande Valley and the southern plains being the areas with the highest risk of prolonged drought. As a result, the risk of prolonged drought in states such as Texas, New Mexico, and to a lesser extent, Louisiana, Arizona, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, and southern California and Nevada will worsen this winter, potentially exacerbating conditions in areas already affected by water scarcity in recent months.

**Somalia Key Message Update: PAfter disrupted gu production season, below-average deyr rainfall is likely, August 2024**
Widespread Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to persist through at least January 2025 in Somalia. Despite three consecutive seasons of average to above-average rainfall supporting gradual recovery among households badly impacted by the 2020-2022 drought, high food assistance needs persist due to ongoing conflict, severe flooding, high food prices, and limited income-earning opportunities. Humanitarian partners provided food assistance to an average of less than 1.3 million people monthly from June to August 2024, but this assistance covered only approximately 35-40 percent of FEWS NET's estimated population in need of food aid. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in settlements have minimal income-generating opportunities, limited access to food, and depleted coping capacity, with decreasing humanitarian assistance. All settlements hosting displaced populations are expected to face either Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes. The below-average deyr rainfall forecast for the upcoming October to December season is likely to contribute to a fourth consecutive season of below-average crop production, exacerbating food insecurity. Revised analysis indicates that the crop-dependent Sorghum High Potential and Bay Bakool Low Potential livelihood zones are expected to deteriorate to Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with most other agropastoral areas expected to continue facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. In northern and central pastoral areas, improved rangeland conditions, higher livestock birth rates, and increased milk production due to above-average gu rainfall are expected to improve food security for poor households through December. However, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to persist in the Addun and Coastal Deeh Pastoral livelihood zones of the central regions, which were badly impacted during the 2020-2022 drought.
