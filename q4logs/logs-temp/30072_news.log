**OpenAI Prepares to Launch New AI Agents: What to Expect**
OpenAI is on the verge of launching new AI agents, a move that CEO Sam Altman believes will set the company apart from others. 'I think 2025 will be the year when agent systems finally go mainstream,' he explains. The main concern is how to make these tools profitable after significant investments in AI. According to Pitchfork, AI startups have received $6.5 million in funding and have been valued at $150 billion collectively. Companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and SoftBank are investing in these companies to attract more corporate clients.

**OpenAI Prepares AI for Computer Control without Human Intervention**
OpenAI is developing an AI agent called 'Operator' that can perform tasks on a computer on behalf of a user. According to sources familiar with the situation, the agent will be able to write emails, create code, book tickets, and more. The company aims to create a computer AI agent for developers by January 2025, initially as a research prototype. OpenAI is working on several research projects related to agents, with the next milestone being a universal prototype that can perform tasks in a web browser. The company's competitors have already released similar agents that can interact with information on a user's computer in real-time. OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman has hinted that the company will release more advanced models, and that agents will be the next major breakthrough. Kevin Weil, director of products, believes that agent systems will become mainstream in 2025. The development of AI agents is a response to the decreased return on investment from OpenAI's existing AI products, which have required significant time, effort, and resources.

**AI News: Sam Altman OpenAI To Launch Operator, Task-Automating AI Tool**
OpenAI, led by Sam Altman, is set to launch Operator, a task-automating AI tool, in January 2025. The tool will allow users to automate tasks such as writing code and booking travel. Operator will be available through OpenAI's API for developers and will be released as a research preview. This move reflects a broader push in the tech sector to enable AI to execute tasks directly on user devices. OpenAI has also expanded its capabilities with ChatGPT Search, which integrates real-time web search into its ChatGPT platform, and introduced SimpleQA, an open-source factuality benchmark to enhance accuracy. However, these developments come amid growing concerns about AI safety within the industry, with OpenAI's Vice President of Research and Safety, Lilian Weng, announcing her resignation after seven years with the company. 'OpenAI is intensifying its commercial focus,' said Weng, reflecting ongoing concerns over the company's evolving priorities.

**OpenAI's Next-Generation Model Faces Performance Ceiling**
OpenAI's next-generation model, Orion, is expected to show a moderate improvement over GPT-4, according to The Information, which has cited anonymous sources within the company. This has sparked debate about the viability of developing increasingly advanced AI models and the laws of scaling, which are theoretical rules about how these models improve. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated that 'the laws of scaling are decided by God; the constants, by the technical team.' However, some of his own employees have expressed doubts about these laws, citing the growing evidence that leading AI models are hitting a performance ceiling. The company has resorted to using additional methods to improve performance, such as incorporating human feedback into the training process. Gary Marcus, a professor at NYU and AI critic, has stated that the development of AI is destined to hit a wall, and that recent models, including OpenAI's Orion, show signs of producing smaller performance gains than their predecessors. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of OpenAI, has also suggested that the results of model scaling have plateaued, and that 'scaling the right things is now more important than ever.' The industry will continue to seek ways to provoke large performance gains, with some experts predicting that the next generation of models will be more expensive to train, with some estimates reaching $100 billion.

**OpenAI Discusses Corporate Structure Transformation with Regulators**
OpenAI is in early-stage negotiations with the California Attorney General's office regarding a potential transformation of its corporate structure into a commercial business, according to Bloomberg sources. The process may involve regulatory review of how the AI startup evaluates intellectual property, the agency notes. The Delaware Attorney General has also discussed the matter with the company. OpenAI declined to comment, emphasizing that the non-profit organization will continue to exist under any restructuring. 'We continue to consult with independent financial and legal advisors. Any potential restructuring will allow the non-profit organization to continue to exist and thrive, and also receive full value for its current share in the commercial company OpenAI and expand its possibilities for fulfilling its mission,' said OpenAI's non-profit board chair Bret Taylor. OpenAI first announced its intention to change its governance structure to a commercial business in June. This would allow the company to generate profits while pursuing its original goal of promoting public benefit. In October, OpenAI raised $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion, with the high valuation dependent on its ability to change its corporate structure and remove profit restrictions for investors. The decision requires approval from the non-profit board, which includes Sam Altman and eight others. It's worth noting that in August, Elon Musk resumed a lawsuit against OpenAI, accusing the company of prioritizing commercial interests over public benefit.

**Openai's Nonprofit Shift to For-Profit Structure Draws Scrutiny Over ChatGPT Valuation**
OpenAI, a $157 billion AI company backed by Microsoft, is in talks with California and Delaware's attorney generals to change its nonprofit structure to a for-profit model. The move, which could take years, will likely face regulatory scrutiny over the valuation of its intellectual property, particularly ChatGPT. OpenAI's nonprofit board chairman, Bret Taylor, said 'Any potential restructuring would ensure the nonprofit continues to exist and receives full value for its stake in the for-profit unit.' The company has until 2026 to complete the shift, after which the funding will turn into debt.

**No one is ready for AGI  --  not even OpenAI**
The departure of Jason Brundage marks the latest in a series of high-profile exits from OpenAI's safety teams. Jan Leike, a prominent researcher, left after claiming that 'safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.' The dissolution of Brundage's 'AGI Readiness' team highlights mounting tensions between OpenAI's original mission and its commercial ambitions. The company faces pressure to transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit public benefit corporation within two years, or risk returning funds from its recent $6.6 billion investment round. This shift toward commercialization has long concerned Brundage, who expressed reservations back in 2019 when OpenAI first established its for-profit division.

**OpenAI has 2 years to transition to a for-profit company. Here are 6 key things it will need to do in that time.**
OpenAI is transitioning to a for-profit company within the next two years, allowing it to raise billions more in funding. This shift comes after tensions between nonprofit purists and those who wanted to move more quickly to develop and release products. The company will need to take several complex steps, including asset conversion, equity distribution, and governance structure changes. Microsoft's $13 billion investment in OpenAI will give it a significant amount of equity in the new structure, which may warrant antitrust regulation. CEO Sam Altman is set to receive a 7% equity stake, valued at $150 billion, although he has dismissed reports of this as 'ludicrous.' OpenAI must also address ongoing litigation, including a lawsuit from Elon Musk, which claims that the company prioritized commercial interests over the public benefit.

**OpenAI reportedly plans to ditch its nonprofit mission with CEO Sam Altman said to be in line to make billions**
OpenAI reportedly plans to abandon its nonprofit mission and adopt a for-profit model, with CEO Sam Altman set to gain significant control and equity. According to reports, the nonprofit organization will continue to exist but will only own a minority stake in the new for-profit structure. This move comes alongside several high-profile departures from OpenAI, including CTO Mira Murati and Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew. The restructuring plans and departures are reportedly correlated. As OpenAI's mission statement from 2015 states, 'OpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence research company. Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.' A shift to for-profit would be a fundamental change, requiring a website purge and potentially altering the company's values. This move is not entirely surprising, given Google's similar shift from 'Don't be evil' to a more commercial focus in 2018.

**OpenAI looks to shift away from nonprofit roots and convert itself to for-profit company**
OpenAI, the company behind the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, is considering a major restructuring that would shift its focus from a nonprofit research institute to a for-profit corporation. The company's board is considering a decision to change OpenAI into a public benefit corporation, which would allow it to prioritize profits while still serving its mission to benefit humanity. However, this move has been met with criticism from Mozilla, which has accused OpenAI of prioritizing profits over its public interest mission. OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman has denied that the company's recent high-profile departures are related to the restructuring, but the move has raised questions about the company's governance structure and its commitment to its original mission.

OpenAI, the artificial intelligence company behind ChatGPT, may be converting from a nonprofit research institute to a for-profit corporation. According to a source, the company's board is considering a decision to change OpenAI's structure to a public benefit corporation, which would make it accountable to shareholders. This move would change the company's mission, as it currently has a nonprofit board of directors focused on helping humanity. As it stands, OpenAI already has a for-profit division, but this change would impact the core of the company's structure.

**OpenAI as we knew it is dead**
OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has abandoned its nonprofit mission to prioritize safety and benefit humanity. CEO Sam Altman will now have ultimate control and equity worth billions, while the nonprofit board has been stripped of its control. This move has been criticized by former employees and AI safety advocates, who argue that it is a money grab and a betrayal of OpenAI's founding principles. The company's shift to a for-profit structure has raised concerns about the potential risks and costs of AI deployment, and has validated the need for regulation and oversight. As one former employee said, 'It seems to me the original nonprofit has been disempowered and had its mission reinterpreted to be fully aligned with profit.'

**OpenAI to Become Commercial Company, Ending Non-Profit Status**
OpenAI, the developer of the popular generative model, will become a commercial company. The company, which was registered as a non-profit organization in 2015, will now officially focus on making a profit. This decision was prompted by a corporate conflict, which led to the departure of three top managers responsible for technology development and research. The company's restructure has been long overdue, according to Alexander Gorny, co-founder of AIAcademy: 'They initially aimed to develop technologies for the benefit of humanity, with open-source code. However, since 2022, they have become one of the most closed companies in the industry, focusing on commercial products and profit, rather than the benefit of society.' OpenAI's shift to a commercial model will make it easier for investors and allow the company to become more profitable. The company has already started to develop tools for corporate clients and has hired more staff focused on sales and finance. As Yuri Brissov, partner at Digital & Analogue Partners, notes: 'The company's non-profit status reduced its responsibility for the fate of its developments. Now, OpenAI is systematizing and starting to negotiate with publishers, promising to pay them money. To pay money, you need to receive income. The natural cycle has occurred.' The period of free access and testing is likely coming to an end, and OpenAI will focus on creating more commercial products, paid access, subscriptions, and paid integrations with businesses.

**OpenAI May Become a Commercial Corporation: Giving Up Non-Profit Control for Investments**
OpenAI is working on transforming its main business into a profitable corporation, which will no longer be controlled by its non-profit board, making the company more attractive to investors, according to sources from Reuters. The non-profit organization OpenAI will remain, but will hold a minority stake in the new company. OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman will receive a share in the commercial company for the first time, with the company's value potentially reaching $150 billion after restructuring. The company is also working to remove restrictions on profits for investors. 'We are still focused on creating artificial intelligence that benefits everyone, and we are working with our board to ensure the best position for achieving success in our mission. The non-profit organization is the foundation of our mission and will continue to exist,' said an OpenAI spokesperson. The restructuring plan is currently being coordinated with lawyers and shareholders, and the timeline for its completion has not been determined. However, the restructuring process coincides with changes in the leadership team, with OpenAI's Director of Technology Mira Murati announcing her departure and President Greg Brockman temporarily absent due to a leave of absence.

**OpenAI Considers Restructuring, Potential Share Grant to Sam Altman**
OpenAI, the developer of the chatbot ChatGPT, is discussing a restructuring plan that would allow its co-founder and CEO Sam Altman to receive 7% of the company's shares. According to Bloomberg, the company is considering this move to become a commercial business and attract funding. OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a non-profit organization, but it is now exploring changes amid the departure of several employees. A representative of the company stated that OpenAI remains focused on developing artificial intelligence and that the non-profit organization 'will continue to exist.' This comes after several high-profile departures, including the technical director Mira Murati, who left the company to focus on her own research, and co-founder John Schulman, who joined rival Anthropic. Co-founder Greg Brockman also took a creative leave of absence until the end of the year, and co-founder Ilya Sutskever left the company in May. Altman was previously fired in November 2023, but was reinstated as CEO in November after a new board of directors was formed. He was allowed to return to the board of directors in March after a legal review.

**OpenAI to Change Status to Commercial Corporation Amid Restructuring**
OpenAI, a non-profit organization founded in 2015, plans to change its status to a commercial corporation, according to Bloomberg. This change comes amid significant personnel changes, including the unexpected departure of technical director Mira Murati. The company is also leaving chief scientist Bob McGrew and vice president of research Barrett Zof. Earlier this year, co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, co-founder and former lead researcher John Schulman, and former lead researcher Yan Leike left the company. Co-founder and former president Greg Brockman recently took a leave of absence until the end of the year. Currently, only three of the 13 people who founded OpenAI in December 2015 remain. OpenAI's transformation began in late 2022 with the release of ChatGPT, which became an instant hit and sparked global interest in the potential of generative AI. Under the leadership of CEO Sam Altman, the company has started releasing new products for consumers and corporate clients, as well as hiring sales, strategy, and finance experts. This has caused concern among some employees, particularly those who have been with the company since its inception, who believe that the company is prioritizing product releases over its original mission of creating safe AI systems. The restructuring of OpenAI is aimed at making it more attractive to investors. The company is currently trying to close a funding round worth up to $6.5 billion, valued at $150 billion. Negotiations are underway with companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and MGX from the UAE. Unlike previous investors, those who invest in the current round will not have restrictions on their profit. However, if the restructuring does not occur within two years, new investors will be able to demand the return of their funds, as stated by Sam Altman, 'We are committed to making OpenAI a sustainable and profitable company, but we also want to ensure that our mission and values remain intact.'

**OpenAI says goodbye to non-profit status, hello to commercial focus**
OpenAI is changing its fundamental values by no longer being a non-profit organization. The company will now be 'for-profit' and its primary goal will be to make money for its owners, rather than serving humanity and the public. According to Reuters, OpenAI is planning to restructure its core business to focus on commercial activities. This will involve a fundamental change that will free the company from the control of its original owner, OpenAI Nonprofit. Microsoft currently owns 49% of OpenAI, but has limited influence due to the control held by OpenAI Nonprofit, which owns only 2% of the company. OpenAI Nonprofit still adheres to the original mission: to serve humanity, make something good with AI, help the world, and benefit the public. With this new move, OpenAI will become more attractive to investors and have a structure similar to most other startup companies. Sam Altman will become a co-owner. According to Reuters, it is planned that OpenAI Nonprofit will still own a small share of OpenAI, but without decisive influence. It is also planned that Sam Altman, the company's famous co-founder and director, will receive an ownership stake in OpenAI for the first time. Reuters estimates that the company will be valued at around $150 billion after the restructuring. The company will not confirm the information to Reuters, which cites unnamed sources. According to Reuters, lawyers and shareholders are currently reviewing the details. It is unclear when the changes will take effect. 'We remain focused on building AI that benefits everyone, and we are working with our board to ensure we are positioned to succeed with our mission. Non-profit is essential to our mission and will continue to exist,' OpenAI said in a statement to Reuters. Three of OpenAI's top executives are leaving the company, including CTO Mira Murati and development directors Barret Zoph and Bob McGrew. Mira Murati has been with the company for nearly seven years and was briefly CEO. She writes on X that she is leaving because she 'wants to create time and space' for herself. Recently, co-founder John Schulman has also left the company to join competitor Anthropic, while co-founder Greg Brockman has announced that he will be on leave for a year. The discussion about OpenAI's future and fundamental values was also the reason for the power struggle in OpenAI in November 2023, where Sam Altman was briefly fired and then reappointed a few days later. Since then, co-founder Ilya Sutskever has also left the company.

**OpenAI's Mira Murati Leaves Company, Sam Altman Prepares for $10.5 Billion Windfall**
Mira Murati, the technical director of OpenAI, has left the company. She explained her decision by saying she wants to 'free up time and space for my own research'. Murati has been with OpenAI for almost six and a half years, joining in June 2018 as a vice president responsible for working with partners. She previously worked at Leap Motion, which developed motion capture technology, and at Tesla. Murati temporarily took over as CEO of OpenAI in November 2023, after the board of directors unexpectedly fired co-founder Sam Altman as CEO. However, Altman was reinstated as CEO just a few days later. The board of directors never explained why Murati was temporarily removed as CEO. Altman has expressed his support for Murati's decision, saying 'it's hard to overstate how much Mira means to OpenAI, our mission, and all of us personally'. He also announced that Bob McGrew, the head of research, and Barrett Zof, the vice president of research, will be leaving the company. McGrew had been with OpenAI for almost eight years, while Zof had been there for just over two years. Altman said that all three had decided to leave independently of each other. OpenAI is preparing for a new funding round, which could value the company at $150 billion and raise $6.5 billion in investments. However, this would require the company to change its governance structure. OpenAI was initially created as a non-profit organization, with a mission to develop safe general artificial intelligence. In 2019, a subsidiary with 'limited commercial profit' was created, called OpenAI LP. This subsidiary is subordinate to the original non-profit organization, which is now referred to as OpenAI Nonprofit. To attract the desired investments, OpenAI must become a fully commercial organization. The decision to change the governance structure has already been made, and the company is now working with lawyers and shareholders to implement the plan. The non-profit structure will continue to exist, but will hold a minority stake in the new commercial organization. The exact timing of these changes is unclear.

OpenAI is planning to restructure its business into a for-profit benefit corporation, giving CEO Sam Altman equity for the first time. This move away from its current nonprofit model comes after key executive Mira Murati announced her resignation as Chief Technology Officer. According to Reuters, the restructuring will mean that the company will no longer be controlled by its non-profit board of directors. The nonprofit will continue to operate and gain a minority ownership stake in the for-profit corporation. Altman's stake valuation is unclear, but he was worth at least $2 billion as of May, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Altman stated, 'We remain focused on building AI that benefits everyone, and we're working with our board to ensure that we're best positioned to succeed in our mission.'

**OpenAI Considers Major Restructuring to Free Itself from Non-Profit Organization**
OpenAI, a non-profit organization founded in 2015, is considering a major restructuring to free itself from the control of its non-profit organization, according to Reuters. The non-profit structure was established to advance digital intelligence in a way that benefits humanity as a whole, without limiting its work to generating financial returns. However, in 2019, OpenAI Global LLC, a for-profit subsidiary with limited liability, was announced to raise capital. OpenAI promised that the non-profit organization would remain intact and its board would continue to govern all activities. However, sources suggest that this scenario may change due to the need for more funding. OpenAI is seeking new investors to fulfill its mission, but its current structure may deter some investors. The solution may be to change the structure, allowing OpenAI to free itself from the control of its non-profit organization. OpenAI's commercial arm is working on a major restructuring, which would involve giving up control of the non-profit organization. A spokesperson for OpenAI stated, 'We are focused on creating AI that benefits everyone, and we are working with our board of directors to ensure we are well-positioned to succeed in our mission. The non-profit organization is fundamental to our mission and will continue to exist.' The non-profit organization would have a minority stake in the for-profit company, which could be effective in attracting more investors, but raises concerns about the centralization of power in a leading AI company, potentially leading to security risks.

OpenAI is planning to restructure its organization, according to Reuters, which would give its nonprofit board less control over the company's main business.

This move could significantly impact the company's future, with the for-profit company potentially being worth $150 billion following the restructuring.

**OpenAI To Remove Non-profit Control**
OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is planning to reorganize its main business into a for-profit benefit corporation, independent of its non-profit board. This move will give CEO Sam Altman shares in the company for the first time, and the non-profit board will no longer have influence over the for-profit company. The non-profit will continue to exist and own a minority stake in the for-profit company. This change could have implications for how the company manages AI risks in a new governance structure. As OpenAI plans to remove the cap on returns for investors, the company's valuation could reach $150 billion. An OpenAI spokesperson said, 'We remain focused on building AI that benefits everyone, and we're working with our board to ensure that we're best positioned to succeed in our mission.'

**OpenAI to Transition from Non-Profit to Commercial Company**
OpenAI, currently operating as a limited liability company controlled by a non-profit organization, is expected to transform into a commercial company. This change in structure may be necessary as the company's investors are awaiting its decision to abandon its non-profit status, which could require a change in its structure, according to Fortune and Reuters sources. Former CEO Sam Altman informed employees at a recent meeting that the company has 'outgrown' its non-profit agreement and is set to transition away from non-profit control. However, an OpenAI representative stated that the non-profit division will continue to exist, as it is 'integral to the company's mission.' The company's valuation is estimated to be over $100 billion, with Apple reportedly investing in OpenAI last month.
