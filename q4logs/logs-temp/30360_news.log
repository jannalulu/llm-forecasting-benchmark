**UBS Analysts Predict Gold to Reach $2900 per Ounce by End of 2025**
Analysts at UBS predict that gold prices will reach $2900 per ounce by the end of 2025. According to them, factors such as Donald Trump's presidency in the US and increased global uncertainty will continue to support gold prices. By the end of 2026, gold prices may reach $2950 per ounce, experts say. 'Gold has become one of the most profitable commodities this year, setting several records before prices fell after the US presidential elections due to the strengthening of the US dollar,' said the article. The rise in gold prices was driven by increased central bank purchases, the Federal Reserve's shift to monetary policy easing, and geopolitical tensions in Europe and the Middle East. Currently, gold is trading at around $2630 per ounce, up 28% from the beginning of the year.

The price of gold for December rose 0.63%, to $2,631.0 per ounce-troy, on the Comex, the metals division of the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex).

**Gold Prices Fall to Two-Month Low as Investors Bet on Decreased Geopolitical Risks**
Gold futures ended the day in decline for the fifth consecutive session, with a loss of 6.35% in November. The December gold contract on the Comex, a division of the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), fell 0.52%, to $2,572.90 per troy ounce. This is the longest losing streak since February, when gold also declined for five consecutive days. The closing price is also the lowest since mid-September. The weakness in gold reflects a possible higher interest rate policy in the United States in 2025 under President Donald Trump, which would increase the cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold. The potential for higher interest rates in the US has driven up the dollar, while gold, priced in dollars, has suffered under this pressure. Additionally, gold is falling as investors begin to bet on a decrease in geopolitical risks. The uncertainty surrounding the US elections has been resolved, and there is hope that conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine may end when Trump takes office.
