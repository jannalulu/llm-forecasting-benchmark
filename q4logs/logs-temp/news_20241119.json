The country has reported no new confirmed cases since October 30, 2024. The 42-day countdown to declare the end of the outbreak has commenced, with no new infections arising during this period required for the outbreak to be declared over. The source of the outbreak is reported to be of zoonotic origin, linked to exposure in a cave inhabited by fruit bats.

There is currently no approved treatment or vaccine for MVD, with some candidate vaccines and therapeutics under investigation.

Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, gastrointestinal symptoms, or unexplained bleeding.

The virus is transmitted through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, and the disease can be spread through prolonged exposure to infected bats. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the disease is a significant threat to global health. The WHO has explained that patients with the disease must receive treatment in a specialized healthcare facility and wait for laboratory test results before they can return home safely. The disease is characterized by a sudden onset of symptoms, including a 'ghost-like' appearance, with sunken eyes, a pale face, and extreme lethargy. The disease can be fatal within 8-9 days of symptom onset, preceded by significant bleeding. A vaccination campaign has begun in Rwanda, with 700 doses of a vaccine being distributed to high-risk populations, including healthcare workers. The vaccine is being tested in a clinical trial, and has already undergone phase 2 testing in Uganda and Kenya.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 04:18 AM\nSource:[Le Dauphin√© Lib√©r√©](https://www.ledauphine.com/magazine-sante/2024/10/15/epidemie-de-virus-marburg-au-rwanda-faut-il-s-inquieter)\n\n**Marburg outbreak tied to Rwanda hospital; US risk is low**\nRwanda has confirmed 61 cases of Marburg virus infections and 14 deaths as of October 13. The outbreak, first reported on September 27, is contained within a hospital cluster in Kigali, with no evidence of community transmission. The disease causes severe symptoms, including headaches, muscle aches, and unexplained bleeding. Although the risk of Marburg appearing in the U.S. is low, the CDC recommends clinicians assess the possibility of the viral hemorrhagic fever in patients who present symptoms or have been in contact with an infected person or have been to an area with a current outbreak in the last 21 days, as stated by the Ministry of Health, 'Symptoms can appear two to 21 days after infection.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 05:32 PM\nSource:[Hospital Review](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/marburg-outbreak-tied-to-rwanda-hospital-us-risk-is-low.html)\n\n**CDC Issues Travel Alert for Rwanda Due to Marburg Virus Outbreak**\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a travel alert for Rwanda due to an outbreak of the Marburg virus, a disease similar to Ebola. The CDC raised its travel alert level to 3 on October 7, advising people to reconsider non-essential travel to the country. The alert applies to all of Rwanda, as cases of Marburg have been confirmed in several areas of the country. For people who 'must' travel to Rwanda, the CDC advises travelers to 'avoid contact with sick people who show symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, and skin rash,' and to 'avoid traditional healers' and 'avoid contact with blood and other bodily fluids.' The CDC also advises people to 'avoid visiting hospitals in the outbreak area for non-urgent medical care or non-medical reasons,' and to 'avoid contact with corpses or items that have been in contact with corpses, participate in funeral or burial rituals, or attend a funeral or burial.' The CDC has also announced that it will begin screening travelers who have been in Rwanda in the last 21 days, starting on October 14. This measure aims to reduce the risk of importing cases of Marburg to the US and its spread within US communities. The Rwandan Ministry of Health has also been screening travelers leaving the country to detect the virus. As of October 9, there have been 58 cases and 13 deaths reported in Rwanda, with a fatality rate of 88%. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) states that the average fatality rate of the disease is 50%. The virus is transmitted to humans by fruit bats and then spreads through contact with the bodily fluids of infected people. There are no approved vaccines or treatments for Marburg in the US, while the Rwandan Minister of Health has said that several promising candidates may soon be tested. The Sabin Vaccine Institute, a non-profit organization, is collaborating with Rwandan authorities on the outbreak, and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative is also involved. A team that developed the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine at the University of Oxford has begun a trial of a Marburg vaccine candidate in the UK using similar technology. Meanwhile, Rwandan authorities are monitoring around 300 contacts of known cases. Approximately 70% of confirmed cases are healthcare workers from two hospitals in the capital, Kigali, although cases have been reported in seven of the country's 30 districts. In addition to spreading in healthcare settings, the disease can also spread at funerals, where physical contact with the deceased is common in some cultures, said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 07:45 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN √âPOCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/cdc-emiten-nueva-advertencia-viaje-ruanda-debido-virus-similar-ebola-1312535.html)\n\n**CDC to start screening travellers from Rwanda to US for Marburg virus**\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that travellers coming into the United States who have been in Rwanda in the previous 21 days will be screened starting next week due to an outbreak of Marburg virus in Rwanda.

The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) said the risk of Marburg illness in European residents traveling or living in affected parts of Rwanda is still considered low, but the risk of exposure in healthcare settings is moderate. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Health Alert Network notice to health providers, urging them to be alert to the possibility of imported cases.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2024 08:03 PM\nSource:[CIDRAP](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/marburg/rwanda-confirms-more-marburg-cases-plans-vaccine-trial)\n\n**Rwanda's Marburg Virus Outbreak: 80% of Cases are Healthcare Professionals**\nAccording to the Minister of Health of Rwanda, Sabin Nsanzimana, around 80% of the 36 confirmed cases of the Marburg virus in the country are healthcare professionals. 'It's a very characteristic feature of outbreaks because many of them proliferate in medical facilities (...). They are the first to be affected by these viruses because they treat sick people in different contexts,' Nsanzimana explained in a joint online press conference with the Director of the African Union's health agency, Jean Kaseya. Rwanda has reported 36 cases and 11 deaths from Marburg since announcing the outbreak last Friday, Nsanzimana recalled, celebrating that five patients tested negative for the virus on Wednesday. 'We will do a second test in a few days to confirm it,' Nsanzimana said. Since the first case was confirmed in a patient admitted to a hospital in Kigali and who has since died, Rwandan health authorities have tracked over 400 contacts who have tested negative for the virus or show no symptoms. 'We will stop this outbreak before it affects other parts of the country or beyond,' Nsanzimana assured. Kaseya called on CDC Africa partners to support Rwanda, saying '(the Marburg virus) can quickly become a regional and continental problem (...). We don't want another outbreak,' he said, referring to the mpox outbreak, which has 34,297 cases (6,806 confirmed) and 866 deaths since the beginning of 2024 in 16 African Union member states, including Rwanda, the only country to have started vaccination against this virus. Rwanda will soon begin clinical trials of vaccines and treatments to address the outbreak, as there is currently no proven vaccine or specific treatment. This is the first time the Marburg virus has been detected in Rwanda, a highly infectious viral hemorrhagic fever of the same family as Ebola. Africa was the scene of two Ebola outbreaks last year: one in Equatorial Guinea, which caused 17 confirmed cases, including 12 deaths; and another in Tanzania, with at least nine cases (eight confirmed and one probable) and six deaths. Before that, there were cases in other countries such as Ghana, Guinea-Conakri, Uganda, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya and South Africa. To prevent its spread, authorities have recommended reinforcing hygiene and avoiding close contact with people showing symptoms of the disease, which include high fever, severe headaches, muscle pains, vomiting and diarrhea. This disease is as deadly as Ebola and is estimated to have killed over 3,500 people in Africa. Like Ebola, the Marburg virus causes sudden hemorrhages and can cause death in a few days, with an incubation period of 2 to 21 days and a mortality rate of up to 88%. Fruit bats are the natural hosts of this virus, which when transmitted to humans can be transmitted through direct contact with fluids such as blood, saliva, vomit or urine. The disease was detected in 1967 in the German city of Marburg - the origin of its name - by laboratory technicians who became infected when investigating monkeys brought from Uganda.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 03, 2024 05:22 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/agencias/2024/10/03/alrededor-del-80-de-los-enfermos-de-marburgo-en-ruanda-son-sanitarios/)\n\n**Marburg Virus Suspicions in Hamburg Not Confirmed**\nThe suspicion of Marburg virus in two people in Hamburg has not been confirmed. The tests were negative, according to the Social Authority. One of the two individuals had recently worked in a hospital in Rwanda, where people infected with the virus were being treated. Both individuals will continue to be monitored. The medical student with contact to an infected person will be observed until the end of the incubation period of up to 21 days. He will be isolated in a special area of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) for the next few days, followed by home isolation under the supervision of the responsible health authority. The companion will also be observed at the UKE over the weekend. There was no risk to fellow travelers during the return journey from Rwanda via Frankfurt to Hamburg by train and plane. The Marburg virus is not airborne, like COVID-19 or influenza viruses, but is transmitted through close contact with severely ill people or their bodily fluids, as stated by the Robert Koch Institute. Normal encounters with people in public and private spaces do not pose a risk. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Marburg virus causes high fever and symptoms such as muscle pain, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and bloody vomiting. In previous outbreaks in Africa, 25-90% of those infected died. Since 1967, there have been no cases of the disease in Germany, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The virus is named after the German city of Marburg, where laboratory staff became infected with the virus in 1967 while working with infected monkeys. As a precaution, the two individuals in Hamburg have been in contact with doctors since their return from Rwanda.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 03, 2024 09:59 AM\nSource:[br.de](https://www.br.de/nachrichten/deutschland-welt/verdacht-auf-marburg-virus-in-hamburg-nicht-bestaetigt,UQ8ApXZ)\n\n**Marburg Virus Outbreak in Rwanda: A Concern for Healthcare Workers**\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been no outbreaks of the Marburg virus in Germany since 1967. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids of infected individuals, such as blood, and not through the air. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days. The Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNITM) states that the Egyptian fruit bat is a reservoir and transmitter of the Marburg virus. Recently, an outbreak of Marburg fever occurred in Rwanda, resulting in the deaths of 10 patients, with 29 cases confirmed as of October 1, according to Health Minister Sabin Nsanzimana. The 19 current patients, mostly medical staff, are isolated. Tropenmediziner Maximilian Gertler from the Berlin Charit√© notes that it is not surprising that healthcare workers are primarily affected, as the infection starts with non-specific symptoms that can be mistaken for malaria or a flu-like illness. 'The perfidious thing about the infection is that it starts with very non-specific symptoms, such as those that can also be caused by malaria or a flu-like illness,' Gertler says. 'When dealing with these diseases, one is always tempted to quickly take blood samples as a healthcare worker or medical professional in the emergency room.' However, this increases the risk of virus transmission.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 03, 2024 05:45 AM\nSource:[DIE WELT](https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article253823978/Hamburg-Verdacht-auf-Marburg-Virus-nach-Aufenthalt-in-Ruanda-Zwei-Menschen-in-Spezialklinik.html)\n\n**Marburg virus kills nine in Rwanda**\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has confirmed 27 cases of Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) and nine deaths in Rwanda as of September 30, 2024.

The CDC office in Rwanda works closely with the government to strengthen health systems and prevent infectious diseases, including training scientists through the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP). The CDC has also worked with Rwanda to implement the US Presidential Plan for Emergency Assistance for HIV/AIDS Relief and the Presidential Malaria Initiative, co-implemented by USAID. These investments and collaborations have strengthened basic capacities that can also be used to respond to this outbreak. The CDC is currently coordinating with the entire US government, including working with the Rwandan ambassador and team on the ground, to address critical public health challenges in the country. The CDC also has a long-standing relationship of trust with the Ministry of Health of Rwanda. The CDC has offered additional support to Rwanda, sending experts to help with the country's investigation and response to the outbreak.

However, author Jay Michaelson questions the feasibility of this plan, citing the Pendleton Act of 1883, which created a civil service system that protects employees from political interference. Michaelson notes that a loophole in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 allows for the exemption of certain positions from civil service protections, but argues that 'the purge won't happen overnight.' A survey by the Partnership for Public Service found that 87% of Americans believe a nonpartisan civil service is important for a strong democracy.

CMN Executive Director Krisanne Vaillancourt Murphy said, 'We're in a time-sensitive and urgent moment because the president has constitutional authority and power to take action to commute the federal death row.' President Biden has a unique opportunity to embrace Catholic teaching and save the lives of those 40 men, according to Murphy. The Catholic Church teaches that the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person, as stated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Murphy noted that President Biden's last month in office will overlap with the start of the 2025 Jubilee of Hope, a Holy Year that emphasizes a time to rebalance and recommit to justice and mercy. Pope Francis launched a special call for the abolition of the death penalty in the Bull of Indiction of the 2025 Jubilee, writing, 'In every part of the world, believers, should be one in demanding dignified conditions for those in prison, respect for their human rights, and above all the abolition of the death penalty.'

Trump's transition team spokesperson said that Trump is the only one who can bring both sides together for peace talks and end the war, as Trump promised during his campaign. However, outsiders expect that the negotiations will force Ukraine to cede some territory. Trump recently announced that Musk and Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Efficiency in the new government. CNN reported that Ramaswamy will target the Department of Defense, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services, and hinted that the government may use the legal basis to implement cuts. He said that the first step of the Department of Efficiency will be to reduce federal spending through administrative actions. Some institutions will be completely abolished, and the bloated federal government will undergo massive layoffs. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that President-elect Trump is using 'revolutionaries' to lead the incoming government, which will change the status quo.

The order directs government agencies to promote voter registration and turnout, but critics argue that the implementation has been biased. Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for The Oversight Project, stated, 'If you target it neutrally, probably not the worst thing in the world. We want civic engagement in the country.' However, Brosnan also noted that the plans submitted by government agencies to promote voter registration have been largely shielded from the public, and that some agencies have partnered with liberal NGOs that push radical ideas such as noncitizen voting and felon voting. Brosnan said, 'They're actually implementing this executive order and putting their thumb on the scale for the federal government to support one candidate over another and juice turnout again.' The potential impact of 'Biden Bucks' on the 2024 presidential election could be significant, especially in Arizona and Michigan, where numerous infirmities in the U.S. election system could dramatically affect the election results.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 09:02 AM\nSource:[The Daily Signal](https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/10/31/biden-bucks-could-change-us-elections-forever/)\n\n**‚ÄòBiden Bucks‚Äô Could Change Elections Forever**\nThe Biden-Harris administration has implemented an executive order, Executive Order 14019, to increase federal involvement in American elections by registering voters and turning out the vote.

The Register has reached 86,712 pages, the third-highest annual count of all time, with two months yet to go. Federal agency guidance documents, including statements of policy, memoranda, and notices, are not reliably cataloged and archived. Since 2020, an informal inventory of these documents has been compiled, with the latest spreadsheet unearthing 108,023. Donald Trump's Executive Order 13,891 required public disclosure on agency website portals, but Joe Biden revoked it. The House passed the 'Guidance Out of Darkness (GOOD) Act' to codify similar disclosure portals. Some agencies continue to report guidance, while others have frozen their counts. Many agencies have 'tombstone' landing pages that refer to the now-inoperative Trump E.O. 13,891. Despite decay, some agencies prominently report guidance in 2024, four years out from Trump's directive. Examples include Commerce Department divisions, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Some agencies archive even rescinded, superseded, or inactive guidance, rather than deleting or obscuring it. However, many agencies present no tractable guidance, and the actual quantity of guidance is often indeterminate. The dispensation of federal dollars is an increasingly powerful regulatory mechanism, and the stipulations embedded within grant programs and Notices of Funding Opportunity belong in any compilation of regulatory dark matter.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 11:56 AM\nSource:[cei.org](https://cei.org/opeds_articles/darklore-depository-2024-a-halloween-inventory-of-federal-agency-guidance-documents/)\n\n**Missouri attempts to halt Biden‚Äôs voter registration executive order**\nThe state of Missouri is attempting to overturn a 2021 executive order signed by President Joe Biden that aimed to educate voters about how to register to vote.

The court denied the petition in the case of Keefer v. Biden without comment, with no dissenting judges. The order requires all federal agencies, including the prison system, to help increase voter registration and participation and promote mail-in voting. Critics say it will likely benefit Democrats more than Republicans. The main petitioner is Pennsylvania state Representative Dawn Keefer, a Republican. The 27 Republican state legislators from Pennsylvania challenged Biden's Executive Order 14019 of March 7, 2021, which requires all federal agencies to help increase voter registration and participation. They argued that the order was unconstitutional and that voter registration campaigns are not a legitimate function of government. They also challenged a voter registration order issued by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat. The legislators argued in their lawsuit that the executive actions violated their constitutional rights by usurping their power to prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections. Judge Jennifer Wilson of the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissed the lawsuit on March 26. 'The legislators were not legitimate to challenge an action that supposedly harmed the legislative assembly as a whole,' she wrote. 'They only alleged an institutional harm derived from a general loss of legislative power.' 'A vague and general allegation that elections, in general, will be undermined, is not the type of case or controversy that this court can pronounce on under Article III [of the US Constitution].' The legislators told the Supreme Court that they wanted an expedited consideration of the issue of standing, so if they prevail, 'they may obtain a preliminary injunction in the district court much before the November 2024 elections.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 03:34 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN √âPOCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/corte-suprema-no-escuchara-impugnacion-orden-biden-registro-votantes-1311825.html)\n\n**Supreme Court won‚Äôt hear challenge to Biden voter registration order**\nThe Supreme Court has declined to hear a challenge from Pennsylvania Republican lawmakers to a Biden administration executive order aimed at boosting voter registration.

The task force, which will be responsible for developing a plan to combat machine gun conversion devices, has 90 days to issue a report. The executive order also seeks to crack down on 3D-printed guns and improve school active shooter drills. Biden said, 'The streets are flooded with machine gun conversion devices because the parts are small, cheap, and easy to make. The impact of these devices is devastating.' The task force will be composed of leaders from several federal departments and agencies. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said, 'We've been working with our U.S. attorney, with the Justice Department, to get machine gun conversions like Glock switches off our city streets.' Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'For as much as we have accomplished, more must be done. We need more leaders like the leaders in this room, in Congress, who have the courage to take action, to stand up to the gun lobby, and to put the lives of our children first.' The work may build on the administration's previous efforts to combat 'ghost guns.' 3D-printed firearms are typically produced at home with computer code downloaded from the internet and often lack a serial number, making them undetectable by law enforcement. Stefanie Feldman, the director of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, said, 'Some 3D-printed firearms can be made to be undetectable by magnetometers used to secure airports, courthouses and event spaces.' A second provision of the executive order aims to improve school-based active shooter drills, which have come under increasing scrutiny as parents, students, and educators say that some versions of the drills are traumatic.

Trump's plan to reclassify federal government employees into Schedule F would allow the president to enhance accountability and job performance within bureaucratic agencies. However, some bureaucrats are concerned that this would lead to an 'exodus' of employees who want to do their jobs according to law and regulation, rather than being political appointees. Republicans believe that Democrats use nonpartisan agencies to push their agenda, while Progressives argue that making legislative redistricting decisions non-political would prevent voters from having a say in the matter. A current Biden administration appointee stated that 'you want people to challenge your thinking' and 'do the kind of research that will get you the best possible current information on a topic,' rather than being dismissed for not being 'unbiased.'

The Biden administration is also planning to transfer $7 billion to Ukraine as soon as possible. While Trump has not yet been formally inaugurated, the Biden administration is using its remaining powers to cause problems for the incoming administration. This includes appointing new ambassadors, judges, and other officials, as well as issuing presidential decrees and pardons. The Biden administration is also using the media to discredit Trump's nominees and policies. The article notes that the Biden administration's actions are a violation of the tradition of a smooth transition of power, and that they are using their remaining time in office to cause problems for the incoming administration.

CMN Executive Director Krisanne Vaillancourt Murphy said, 'We're in a time-sensitive and urgent moment because the president has constitutional authority and power to take action to commute the federal death row.' President Biden has a unique opportunity to embrace Catholic teaching and save the lives of those 40 men, according to Murphy. The Catholic Church teaches that the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person, as stated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church.

Biden stated, 'Our relations with Iran have not been normalized yet, and the implementation of the agreements with Iran dated January 19, 1981, is still ongoing. Therefore, I have decided that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170 regarding Iran.' According to the National Emergency Act, the national emergency will automatically expire unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and submits it to Congress within 90 days, as stated on the White House website. Biden continued, 'I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the notice attached, which states that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170, regarding Iran, which was declared on November 14, 1979, will continue in effect beyond November 14, 2024.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 01, 2024 08:44 PM\nSource:[annahar.com](https://www.annahar.com/international/united-states/166551/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%86-%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%AF-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85)\n\n**Marc Elias: Fed judge rejects GOP state officials attempt to block Biden's voting access EO**\nA federal judge rejected a request by Republican state officials, led by Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft and Arkansas Secretary of State John Thurston, to block President Joe Biden's executive order expanding voting access.

The order directs government agencies to promote voter registration and turnout, but critics argue that the implementation has been biased. Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for The Oversight Project, stated, 'If you target it neutrally, probably not the worst thing in the world. We want civic engagement in the country.' However, Brosnan also noted that the plans submitted by government agencies to promote voter registration have been largely shielded from the public, and that some agencies have partnered with liberal NGOs that push radical ideas such as noncitizen voting and felon voting. Brosnan said, 'They're actually implementing this executive order and putting their thumb on the scale for the federal government to support one candidate over another and juice turnout again.' The potential impact of 'Biden Bucks' on the 2024 presidential election could be significant, especially in Arizona and Michigan, where numerous infirmities in the U.S. election system could dramatically affect the election results.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 09:02 AM\nSource:[The Daily Signal](https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/10/31/biden-bucks-could-change-us-elections-forever/)\n\n**‚ÄòBiden Bucks‚Äô Could Change Elections Forever**\nThe Biden-Harris administration has implemented an executive order, Executive Order 14019, to increase federal involvement in American elections by registering voters and turning out the vote.

The Register has reached 86,712 pages, the third-highest annual count of all time, with two months yet to go. Federal agency guidance documents, including statements of policy, memoranda, and notices, are not reliably cataloged and archived. Since 2020, an informal inventory of these documents has been compiled, with the latest spreadsheet unearthing 108,023. Donald Trump's Executive Order 13,891 required public disclosure on agency website portals, but Joe Biden revoked it. The House passed the 'Guidance Out of Darkness (GOOD) Act' to codify similar disclosure portals. Some agencies continue to report guidance, while others have frozen their counts. Many agencies have 'tombstone' landing pages that refer to the now-inoperative Trump E.O. 13,891. Despite decay, some agencies prominently report guidance in 2024, four years out from Trump's directive. Examples include Commerce Department divisions, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Some agencies archive even rescinded, superseded, or inactive guidance, rather than deleting or obscuring it. However, many agencies present no tractable guidance, and the actual quantity of guidance is often indeterminate. The dispensation of federal dollars is an increasingly powerful regulatory mechanism, and the stipulations embedded within grant programs and Notices of Funding Opportunity belong in any compilation of regulatory dark matter.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 11:56 AM\nSource:[cei.org](https://cei.org/opeds_articles/darklore-depository-2024-a-halloween-inventory-of-federal-agency-guidance-documents/)\n\n**Missouri attempts to halt Biden‚Äôs voter registration executive order**\nThe state of Missouri is attempting to overturn a 2021 executive order signed by President Joe Biden that aimed to educate voters about how to register to vote.

The court denied the petition in the case of Keefer v. Biden without comment, with no dissenting judges. The order requires all federal agencies, including the prison system, to help increase voter registration and participation and promote mail-in voting. Critics say it will likely benefit Democrats more than Republicans. The main petitioner is Pennsylvania state Representative Dawn Keefer, a Republican. The 27 Republican state legislators from Pennsylvania challenged Biden's Executive Order 14019 of March 7, 2021, which requires all federal agencies to help increase voter registration and participation. They argued that the order was unconstitutional and that voter registration campaigns are not a legitimate function of government. They also challenged a voter registration order issued by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat. The legislators argued in their lawsuit that the executive actions violated their constitutional rights by usurping their power to prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections. Judge Jennifer Wilson of the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissed the lawsuit on March 26. 'The legislators were not legitimate to challenge an action that supposedly harmed the legislative assembly as a whole,' she wrote. 'They only alleged an institutional harm derived from a general loss of legislative power.' 'A vague and general allegation that elections, in general, will be undermined, is not the type of case or controversy that this court can pronounce on under Article III [of the US Constitution].' The legislators told the Supreme Court that they wanted an expedited consideration of the issue of standing, so if they prevail, 'they may obtain a preliminary injunction in the district court much before the November 2024 elections.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 03:34 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN √âPOCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/corte-suprema-no-escuchara-impugnacion-orden-biden-registro-votantes-1311825.html)\n\n**Supreme Court won‚Äôt hear challenge to Biden voter registration order**\nThe Supreme Court has declined to hear a challenge from Pennsylvania Republican lawmakers to a Biden administration executive order aimed at boosting voter registration.

The Biden administration is also rushing to spend $7.1 billion in weapons and $2.2 billion to put weapons systems on long-term contracts. Additionally, the White House is prioritizing the confirmation of federal judges before Trump's inauguration. Trump has pledged to rescind unspent funds and stop clean-energy development projects.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 16, 2024 06:12 PM\nSource:[latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-11-16/the-last-actions-the-biden-administration-will-take-before-trump-takes-over-the-white-house)\n\n**DOJ Introduces Rules to Limit Certain Data Transactions in Interest of National Security**\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) has introduced a proposed rule to limit certain data transactions that could compromise national security. The rule, issued on October 29, 2024, prohibits and restricts transactions involving bulk sensitive personal data of U.S. citizens or U.S. government-related data, particularly from countries of concern like China. The rule covers sensitive personal data such as human genomic data, biometric identifiers, precise geolocation data, personal health data, and personal financial data. To be covered, a transaction must involve 'bulk thresholds' of 100 to 100,000 U.S. persons. This move builds on President Biden's Executive Order 14117 and comments submitted in response to the DOJ's ANPRM.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[akingump.com](https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/blogs/ag-data-dive/doj-introduces-rules-to-limit-certain-data-transactions-in-interest-of-national-security)\n\n**Trump to Repeal 94 Biden Executive Orders After Inauguration**\nAccording to Caroline Livitt, press secretary for Donald Trump's team, Trump plans to repeal 94 executive orders issued by his predecessor Joe Biden within the first seven days of his inauguration. Livitt stated that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris signed dozens of directives to deviate from Trump's 'effective political course', leading to a migration and economic crisis. 'Therefore, Trump was re-elected to reverse the steps taken by the Biden and Harris administration', Livitt explained.

The order directs government agencies to promote voter registration and turnout, but critics argue that the implementation has been biased. Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for The Oversight Project, stated, 'If you target it neutrally, probably not the worst thing in the world. We want civic engagement in the country.' However, Brosnan also noted that the plans submitted by government agencies to promote voter registration have been largely shielded from the public, and that some agencies have partnered with liberal NGOs that push radical ideas such as noncitizen voting and felon voting. Brosnan said, 'They're actually implementing this executive order and putting their thumb on the scale for the federal government to support one candidate over another and juice turnout again.' The potential impact of 'Biden Bucks' on the 2024 presidential election could be significant, especially in Arizona and Michigan, where numerous infirmities in the U.S. election system could dramatically affect the election results.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 09:02 AM\nSource:[The Daily Signal](https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/10/31/biden-bucks-could-change-us-elections-forever/)\n\n**Darklore Depository 2024: A Halloween Inventory Of Federal Agency Guidance Documents**\nThe U.S. Code archives federal laws, while the 186,000-page Code of Federal Regulations contains rules from the daily Federal Register.

Federal agency guidance documents, including statements of policy, memoranda, and notices, are not reliably cataloged and archived. Since 2020, an informal inventory of these documents has been compiled, with the latest spreadsheet unearthing 108,023. Donald Trump's Executive Order 13,891 required public disclosure on agency website portals, but Joe Biden revoked it. The House passed the 'Guidance Out of Darkness (GOOD) Act' to codify similar disclosure portals. Some agencies continue to report guidance, while others have frozen their counts. Many agencies have 'tombstone' landing pages that refer to the now-inoperative Trump E.O. 13,891. Despite decay, some agencies prominently report guidance in 2024, four years out from Trump's directive. Examples include Commerce Department divisions, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Some agencies archive even rescinded, superseded, or inactive guidance, rather than deleting or obscuring it. However, many agencies present no tractable guidance, and the actual quantity of guidance is often indeterminate.

However, Chief Justice John Roberts previously addressed a similar argument in the 2023 case of Moore v.

The move has led to a significant decrease in illegal border crossings. According to Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, a politics scientist at the Migration Policy Institute, 'I think it has contributed in many ways to dispelling concerns about a crisis narrative.' The combination of fewer migrant lines at the border and reduced media coverage of the issue has changed the situation for voters, Putzel-Kavanaugh said. With the executive order, Biden has effectively overnight solved Harris' biggest political problem, which was the issue of migration. The number of encounters at the US-Mexico border has decreased significantly, from 250,000 in December 2023 to 58,038 in August 2024, according to the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency. This has taken away a key argument for the Republicans against Harris in the 2024 US election, and has also reduced Trump's lead in the polls on the issue of migration.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 07:56 PM\nSource:[HNA](https://www.hna.de/politik/us-wahl-wahlgeschenk-fuer-harris-biden-macht-grenzen-dicht-und-nimmt-trump-den-wind-aus-dem-segel-zr-93321998.html)\n\n**Biden Administration Reports Significant Decrease in Migrant Encounters at US-Mexico Border**\nAccording to US Customs and Border Protection, there was a nearly 68% decrease in encounters with migrants at the border in August 2024 compared to the previous year. Officials attribute this to an executive order issued by President Joe Biden. The White House reported a significant decrease in migrant encounters at the US-Mexico border since Biden's executive order to strengthen immigration law enforcement. The number of migrant encounters in August was significantly lower than the previous year, wrote White House spokesperson Angelo Fern√°ndez Hern√°ndez in a statement. Since Biden's executive order on June 4, there has been a 50% decrease in encounters at the border. According to US Customs and Border Protection, in August there were around 58,000 migrant encounters at ports of entry along the southern border, a nearly 68% decrease from the 181,000 in August 2023. The total number of encounters at the southern border was around 63,000. This number includes around 5,000 migrants who arrived at ports of entry without a CBP One registration. CBP One is a mobile app that allows migrants to schedule appointments at ports of entry instead of crossing illegally. US border officials said the app has played a crucial role in streamlining border processes. In August, around 44,700 people were processed through CBP One. Since its introduction in January 2023, over 813,000 people have scheduled appointments. US border officials also said that the June executive actions led to an increase in deportations of migrants, with over 131,000 people deported to more than 140 countries since June. Around 400 international repatriation flights have taken place during this time. However, even with the latest numbers, some Republican lawmakers criticized the Biden administration during a hearing on Thursday to discuss possible terrorist threats and national security issues related to illegal immigration. Lawmakers argued that the perception of border agents as welcoming, rather than focused on law enforcement, is contributing to the number of migrants arriving in the US. 'Our border patrol, our law enforcement agents were moved from their role of national security, their role of enforcing immigration law [to] repel illegal entry and capture those crossing illegally as much as possible to a kind of reception and care and transportation, food, etc.,' said Rep. Clay Higgins, a Republican from Alabama, expressing his concern about migrants crossing illegally and evading Border Patrol. There is no indication that the Biden administration has officially changed the role of Border Patrol agents in law enforcement. Alex Nowrasteh, vice president of economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, testified during the hearing that the main reason migrants come to the US, legally or illegally, is to work. 'It's still the economy.

The company's factory in Virginia was closed indefinitely after an investigation found outdated practices, including insects, mold, and poor facilities. The USDA was aware of the issues in 2022, but the new head of sanitation, Terrence Boyce, faced pushback from management and was terminated after eight months. The listeria outbreak has been deemed the largest in the nation since 2011, with deaths occurring in eight states. The CDC urges consumers to check their food and ensure it does not belong to the recalled products, which are labeled 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' and have sell-by dates of Oct. 2024.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 26, 2024 04:16 PM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3167337/lawmakers-call-for-consequences-after-listeria-outbreak-death-toll-reaches-10)\n\n**Boar's Head Listeriosis Outbreak Linked to Tenth Death, Lawmakers Demand Investigation**\nA tenth person has died due to a listeriosis outbreak linked to a Boar's Head factory in Virginia. This comes after a national recall of potentially contaminated meats from the company. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), since the last update in late August, two more cases and one additional death have been reported. As of September 23, a total of 59 people in 19 states have been infected with the epidemic strain of Listeria, all of whom required hospitalization. The CDC warned that the number of reported cases of the disease may increase, as it can take up to 10 weeks for some people to show symptoms of listeriosis. Some lawmakers are now calling for the US Department of Agriculture and the Department of Justice to investigate whether Boar's Head should face criminal charges. 'It is unacceptable that Boar's Head has not taken sufficient measures to correct these conditions that have led to repeated violations for similar problems,' wrote Senator Richard Blumenthal and Representative Rosa DeLauro in a letter sent to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Attorney General Merrick Garland. 'It is high time to act and we urge your agencies to work together to obtain immediate justice for the affected consumers and to prevent this from happening again.' Boar's Head responded to a request for comment by referring Quartz to a statement from the company, which was last updated on September 13. 'We understand the gravity of this situation and the profound impact it has had on the affected families,' the company said. 'Global measures are being taken to prevent such an incident from happening again.' Boar's Head had earlier this month announced that it would be 'indefinitely' closing its Virginia sausage factory, which was linked to a deadly listeriosis outbreak this summer. The transformation of liver sausage was the source of contamination and will be permanently stopped, the company added. Federal inspectors had found dozens of infractions at the Boar's Head facility in Virginia, which is now closed. Inspectors from the US Department of Agriculture reported at least 69 non-compliance violations, including mold, water puddles, and the presence of insects near food, according to records obtained by CBS News through a Freedom of Information Act request. Listeria monocytogenes can cause severe listeriosis infections in young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. It is estimated that in the US, 1,600 people contract listeriosis each year, with approximately 260 annual deaths, according to the CDC.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 26, 2024 02:35 PM\nSource:[Quartz](https://fr.qz.com/deces-dus-a-l-epidemie-de-listeriose-de-la-tete-de-sang-1851658375)\n\n**Boar's Head Confirms Tenth Death in Listeria Outbreak, Recalls Meat Product**\nBoar's Head has confirmed the tenth death related to the listeria outbreak linked to their recalled meat product. The company has acknowledged that the actual number of cases may be higher due to various factors, such as delayed testing and delayed reporting. Symptoms of listeria infection can take up to 10 weeks to appear. Boar's Head has suspended sales of their liver sausage and closed their Virginia plant, which was linked to the outbreak. The company has also implemented a corporate food safety program. In a letter to consumers, Boar's Head expressed their 'unwavering commitment to our customers and the safety and quality of our products.' They stated that they are determined to learn from this incident and emerge stronger. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that consumers check their homes for recalled products with the code 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA mark, with expiration dates up to October 2024. Listeria bacteria cause listeriosis, the third leading cause of foodborne illness in the US. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, and fatigue. Infection can also lead to neck stiffness, headaches, confusion, or seizures. While the outbreak is linked to Boar's Head's liver sausage, maintaining overall health and well-being remains crucial. Regularly checking expiration dates and following food safety guidelines can help prevent listeria infections.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 11:06 PM\nSource:[Zeitung \"Aussiedlerbote\" / –ì–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞ \"–ü–µ—Ä–µ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –í–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫\"](https://aussiedlerbote.de/ru/siedmoi-lietalnyi-sluchai-zarieghistrirovannyi-v-riezultatie-vspyshki-listierii-sviazannoi-s-vyvodom-miasa-iz-produktovykh-maghazinov-golova-kabana)\n\n**Boar's Head Suspends Liverwurst Sales Amid Listeria Outbreak**\nThe authorities have acknowledged that the number of listeria cases is likely higher than reported due to various factors. It can take up to 10 weeks for listeria symptoms to appear, some individuals who fall ill are not tested, and linking a disease to an outbreak can take weeks. Boar's Head has considered this listeria outbreak a concerning chapter in their past and has decided to suspend sales of their liverwurst after an investigation revealed their production process as the cause of contamination. As part of their response, they have closed the Virginia plant linked to the outbreak and established a company-wide food safety program. The Jarratt, Virginia plant has been offline since last July, when the liverwurst recall was initially announced and later expanded to include all products made there. Boar's Head has expressed their unwavering commitment to their customers and the safety and quality of their products in a letter to consumers. They are determined to learn from this incident and come out stronger. The CDC advises consumers to check their homes for recalled products, which bear the 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA inspection mark on the labels and have expiration dates up to October 2024. Listeria bacteria cause listeriosis, the third deadliest foodborne illness in the US. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, and fatigue. An infection can also cause neck stiffness, headache, confusion, or seizures. Despite the outbreak being linked to Boar's Head's liverwurst, promoting overall health and wellness remains crucial during this time. Regularly checking food expiration dates and adhering to food safety guidelines can help prevent listeria infections.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 11:06 PM\nSource:[Zeitung \"Aussiedlerbote\" / –ì–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞ \"–ü–µ—Ä–µ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –í–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫\"](https://aussiedlerbote.de/it/settimo-caso-mortale-segnalato-in-un-focolaio-di-listeria-associato-al-ritiro-di-carne-da-negozio-di-boars-head)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The company, which has secured approximately ‚Ç¨10bn in funding since its inception in 2016, is focusing on survival by reducing its operations due to production issues, the loss of a key customer, and difficulties in securing additional funding. Northvolt spokesperson said, 'Since the beginning of the strategic review, we have constantly been discussing different options and that hasn't changed throughout the process.' Despite recent difficulties, the company is close to securing a financing package exceeding $300m to strengthen its financial stability.

Despite this, operations, including reservations and ticket sales, continue normally. The airline has reached a voluntary agreement with a majority of its bondholders to reduce its debt and gain financial flexibility, aiming to strengthen its position in the low-cost flight market and ensure long-term sustainability. Spirit plans to sell 23 Airbus A320ceo and A321ceo aircraft to GA Telesis for approximately $519 million, with deliveries expected between October 2024 and February 2025. The airline also plans to reduce its annual costs by $80 million, including a reduction in staff to adjust to next year's flight projections. Spirit's financial crisis began in January 2024, following the collapse of a $6.6 billion acquisition deal with JetBlue due to US Department of Justice objections under antitrust laws. The airline faces a debt of over $1 billion, with refinancing postponed until the end of December this year. Spirit operates several routes between Colombia and US cities like Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, so travelers flying with this airline should be aware of any changes to their itinerary, although the company has not announced that they will be affected.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 18, 2024 12:26 PM\nSource:[bluradio.com](https://www.bluradio.com/turismo/spirit-airlines-se-declaro-en-quiebra-estados-unidos-so35)\n\n**Debts with the Tax Authority: Which Ones Will Be Canceled in 2025?**\nDebts with the tax authority will be canceled after a certain period of time. The period varies depending on the type of outstanding charge. For example, for debts related to the payment of IRPEF, IVA, IRES, Irap, or stamp duty, the cancellation occurs after 10 years. However, in this period, sanctions and interest are also calculated on the debt. For these, the cancellation occurs after 5 years. Many debts in 2025 will be canceled automatically due to the reform of the cancellation period. Specifically, debts considered uncollectible after 5 years due to the debtor's death, company bankruptcy, or debtor's nullity will be canceled automatically. For other debts, it is necessary to send a self-help request after receiving a payment reminder. As of January 1, 2025, the following debts will be canceled: tax notices issued from January 1, 2020, for local taxes; tax and duty notices issued from January 1, 2015; and car toll notices that expired before January 1, 2022.

The law introduced a three-year deadline for late creditors to file their claims, but there was uncertainty about how this deadline would apply to bankruptcies declared before the law's implementation. The STJ recently ruled that the new law should be applied to avoid immediately eliminating the right of creditors to file previously acquired debts. As a result, the starting point for the three-year deadline is now January 23, 2021, allowing creditors to file claims that were previously pending. This decision has significant implications for the administration of old bankruptcies, providing a window for creditors with acquired rights under the previous regime to exercise their rights. The STJ's position avoids the immediate extinguishment of acquired rights under the previous legislation. The benefits of this decision include the protection of acquired rights, legal certainty, and the increase in the efficiency of the bankruptcy process.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 10:45 AM\nSource:[terrabrasilnoticias.com](https://terrabrasilnoticias.com/2024/10/nova-lei-de-falencias-o-que-muda-para-os-empreendedores/)\n\n**iRobot (IRBT) Set to Announce Quarterly Earnings on Tuesday**\niRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) is set to announce its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, November 5th.

The company reported revenues of $2.51 billion in Q3 2024, a 12% year-over-year increase and 9% organic growth. However, its high debt leverage of approximately 7x and upcoming debt maturities in 2025-2026 pose significant risks to the company's future growth prospects. BHC's management has been actively evaluating options to maximize the value of its equity stake in Bausch+Lomb (BLCO) for shareholders, which could lead to significant upside for the company. Despite these efforts, the company faces risks from potential generic competition, particularly for its key products like Xifaxan, and its high debt levels may limit its ability to invest in research and development.

The bid comes as Bausch + Lomb's parent company, Bausch Health, is struggling with a $21 billion debt pile and has been put up for sale to resolve an impasse over a separation. TPG already owns ophthalmology company BVI Medical, and Blackstone has expressed interest in buying Bausch + Lomb before it went public in 2022. Formal bids are expected by the end of the month, but it is still possible that a deal may not occur. Bausch + Lomb's chief executive, Brent Saunders, has said that the company is 'a great asset' and that he is 'excited' about the potential sale. However, some creditors, including Apollo Management and Elliott Management, have expressed concerns about the sale and have opposed a spin-off process. 'A sale would allow Bausch Health to pay down its debts and potentially pay a special dividend to shareholders,' said one person familiar with the matter. However, this move would likely rankle creditors.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 09:06 AM\nSource:[Financial Times News](https://www.ft.com/content/52aaf972-1f3a-4017-b181-74c3a3c1e6ef)\n\n**Bausch Health Companies (TSE:BHC) Trading Down 1.2%  - What's Next?**\nShares of Bausch Health Companies Inc.

Since the bye week, the Eagles have gone on a six-game winning streak, giving up a total of just 68 points, or 11.3 per game. Fangio's tireless work ethic and ability to adapt and improve have been key factors in the team's success. 'Yeah, just again, his tireless work ethic,' said head coach Nick Sirianni. 'I think I've probably always, with him being as good of a coach as he's been in this league for this long, I think I probably would have been able to guess that he works his butt off.' Fangio's staff, which includes veterans like DL coach Clint Hurtt and DB coach Christian Parker, has also made a significant impact. 'I think he's consistent with everything,' Sirianni said. 'I don't think there's a lot of surprises once you make a mistake. I think guys respect the consistency.

The team's celebrations, selflessness, and physicality are all contributing to their success. Sirianni said, 'There are a lot of things you can tell in interactions of team meetings... You can tell things like that, just the energy, the flow, all those different things. I always think there is a lot to be said for how guys celebrate together. I think that's a big deal.' The team's offense has become the most dangerous rushing attack in the NFL, and their defense is young and exciting. Everything seems to be working together, and Sirianni believes that the team can continue to get better. As he said, 'It's the same thing with team.

However, it would be surprising to see the Eagles make a move involving Sirianni this season, as they had the chance to move on during the offseason but decided to keep him.

Despite having a bye week to get healthy, the team's struggles have raised concerns about Sirianni's ability to lead the team. The Eagles have committed numerous penalties, including forcing collisions with their own punt returner, and have struggled with quarterback Jalen Hurts, who has thrown 27 turnovers since the start of the 2023 season. Sirianni's decision-making has been questioned, including going for it early against the Atlanta Falcons and passing on third-and-3 late in the game. The team's performance has been described as 'all-around embarrassing' and has sparked calls for Sirianni to be fired to save the 2024 season. However, owner Jeffrey Lurie may not take action, given the team's recent success and Sirianni's past achievements, including taking the team to the Super Bowl two years ago.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2024 09:01 PM\nSource:[The Philadelphia Inquirer](https://www.inquirer.com/eagles/eagles-buccaneers-nick-sirianni-coaching-undisciplined-team-20240929.html)\n\n**Will Eagles fire Nick Sirianni?

The Eagles were blown out by the Buccaneers in Week 4, 33-16, and fans are wondering if Sirianni's coaching decisions are to blame. Despite a 10-1 start to the 2023 season, the Eagles lost five of their final six games and were eliminated in the wild-card round. Sirianni has been criticized for his coaching decisions, and the team's regression under quarterback Jalen Hurts, who has four touchdowns and four interceptions this season. The Eagles have a bye in Week 5, but Sirianni can't afford many more losses if he wants to keep his job.

Fans flooded social media with strong reactions and calls for Sirianni's dismissal, with one fan account saying, 'Pack things up. Fire Nick Sirianni. Use the bye week to reset and see if Kellen Moore can coach this team.' Sirianni, who was originally hired by the Eagles in 2021, has had a successful first three seasons, but has struggled against the Buccaneers, losing to them in the NFC Wild Card round in 2022 and 2024 by a combined score of 63-24.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2024 06:55 PM\nSource:[The Post and Courier](https://www.postandcourier.com/arena/cfb-nfl/frustration-mounts-as-fans-call-for-nfl-head-coachs-dismissal/article_521bd82f-4c9f-57e9-b5a4-672a7f243ab9.html)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The company has a track record of surpassing expectations and has spoken of 'insane' demand for its products. Nvidia's top GPUs are considered the best around, and the company has a broad range of products and services that make it easy for customers to access its offerings. The upcoming report represents a transition for the company as it prepares to launch its new Blackwell architecture. While some investors may see a lower growth figure as a disappointment, comments from Jensen Huang, Larry Ellison, and Elon Musk suggest that Nvidia may have a good deal of positive news to report. As a result, it's possible that the stock will rise after Nov. 20.

Nvidia, the world's largest company by market value, is expected to post net income of $18.4 billion and revenue of $33 billion, but its shares took a 2% hit after reports of problems with its new Blackwell AI chips. Despite this, stock index futures are trying to recover from last week's losses, and the broader earnings season has beaten estimates with 9% aggregate annual profit growth. However, next year's growth estimates are being pared back, with full-year S&P500 profit growth forecasts dropping to 14%. The Treasury market has steadied, with 10-year yields remaining below 4.5%, and futures pricing shows a 60% chance of further easing in December.

Nvidia's dominance in the AI market is due to its superior technology, with its chips being 25 times more profitable than its closest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices. The company is committed to updating its chips every year, and its new Blackwell chips are already in high demand, with analysts projecting $10 billion in added revenue before the end of the year. Meanwhile, Apple is experiencing growing pains, with reports of less-than-stellar sales of its latest iPhone model. As a result, Nvidia is expected to pull ahead and take the lead position in the race for the world's largest market cap.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2024 01:50 PM\nSource:[USA Today](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/10/21/nvidia-market-cap-nearing-3-5-trillion-apple/75772989007/)\n\n**Will Nvidia Be a $10 Trillion Stock by 2029?**\nNvidia's market capitalization has tripled three times in the past six years, and the company is on the verge of tripling its market cap again. With a current market cap of $3.2 trillion, Nvidia is one of the largest companies in the world. The company's end markets are growing rapidly, with AI chip demand expected to rise 33% in 2024 and 20% annually over the next five years. Nvidia has a stranglehold on the market with an estimated 88% share of GPU spending. Wall Street analysts are forecasting 52.5% annual sales growth for Nvidia over the next five years. While Nvidia's premium valuation is high, the company's rapid growth may justify it. If Nvidia lives up to analysts' expectations, the company could report $794 billion in revenue by 2029 and approach a $10 trillion market cap.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 01:00 PM\nSource:[fool.com](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/10/will-nvidia-be-a-10-trillion-dollar-stock-by-2029/)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

As the new US presidency takes office in January 2025, investors are concerned about the impact of new policies on big tech. Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO of IBM, expects more innovation and less regulation in the tech sector, with 'guardrails.' William Kerwin, an analyst at Morningstar Technology, emphasizes that tariffs will be a crucial element, with a proposed 60% tariff on Chinese imports. However, he is optimistic about mergers and acquisitions and antitrust regulations, expecting more deals and regulations focused on platforms and use cases rather than specific companies or products. Kerwin also believes that companies well-exposed to artificial intelligence are overvalued, but sees opportunities in the chip equipment and semiconductor sectors, particularly in companies that are well-positioned despite cyclicality worries and fears of AI maturity. 'High exposure to China does not necessarily equate to high investment risk,' Kerwin notes. 'I do not expect significant breakups, but regulations that erode the competitive advantages big tech companies enjoy at the moment.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2024 08:30 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

IBM focused on cost-cutting and buybacks, but neglected the growing cloud-infrastructure market. Microsoft, under CEO Satya Nadella, adopted a 'mobile first, cloud first' mantra, expanding its cloud services and launching new hardware devices. Microsoft's strategy paid off, with its revenue growing at a 11% CAGR and EPS growing at a 16% CAGR from 2014 to 2024. IBM's revenue declined at a negative 6% CAGR and EPS shrank at a negative 9% CAGR from 2021 to 2023. However, under new CEO Arvind Krishna, IBM's revenue grew at a 4% CAGR and EPS increased at a 13% CAGR.

Mid-cap stocks ($2 billion-$10 billion) have higher growth potential but come with more volatility. Small-cap stocks (<$2 billion) offer the highest growth potential but with increased risk. Consider your risk tolerance, financial goals, and time horizon when choosing between large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks.

While Apple's revenue is significantly higher at $385 billion, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue, with a 122% year-over-year increase in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Nvidia's growth potential is driven by its graphics processing units (GPUs) powering the AI revolution, and its upcoming Blackwell architecture, which is expected to unlock massive speed gains. Analysts believe Nvidia's revenue will grow around 42% next year, far outpacing Apple's projections of 8% growth. However, Nvidia still generates about half the profits of Apple, but with its growth pace and stronger profit margin, it could quickly catch Apple's profit levels.

The company's market cap is around $3 trillion, and it has benefited from its investments in artificial intelligence (AI). However, its share price has fallen by 3% in the past six months, and its year-to-date gains trail the S&P 500. Analysts' average price target is around $494, indicating a potential 20% rise in the next year. However, the company's results in upcoming quarters may be underwhelming, leading to downgrades and price target cuts. Microsoft's diversified businesses and long-term growth opportunities make it a good stock to own, but its high price-to-earnings multiple of 35 may be a concern. The company's AI assistant, Copilot, has not been winning over customers, and its heavy investments in AI are eating into its bottom line.

According to BTIG technical analyst Jonathan Krinsky, the fact that the 50-DMA is falling and trading below the 200-DMA for the third time in as many months is 'clearly not a great sign.' Additionally, Microsoft's stock has recently broken below a year-long upward channel and key support levels on a relative-strength basis, and has dropped to its lowest levels since August 2023.

These include the company's strong fundamentals, with record revenue and second-highest EPS number, as well as its ability to grow total revenues by over 15% year on year. Additionally, the company has boosted its dividend and authorized a $60 billion buyback of shares, indicating management's optimism about the years ahead. Many analysts are also bullish on the stock, with price targets above $500, and the technical setup of the stock is strong, with higher lows being set on the way up.
