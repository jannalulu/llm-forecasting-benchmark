**ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan: 'Do I Have to Wait Until Everyone in Gaza Dies to Issue an Arrest Warrant?'**
The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, has stated that issuing an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now a matter of urgency, asking 'Do I have to wait until everyone in Gaza dies to issue an arrest warrant?' Khan emphasized that taking action against Israeli officials should not be delayed, as they are not above international law. Khan requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in May for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity since October 7, 2023. In response to a question from a German journalist, Khan replied with a laugh, 'Do I have to wait until everyone dies? If your father or mother or grandfather was taken hostage, would you really want me to wait? If your child or sister was torn apart, would you want me to wait?' Khan added, 'Why is the law applied to Ukrainians and Sudanese but not to Palestinians? Is it acceptable to exclude a specific geographic area from international law?' Khan noted that all member states of the International Criminal Court, except Canada, recognize Palestine as a state. Khan rejected accusations of anti-Semitism against him, saying 'There are many insults, threats, and manipulations between politicians, intelligence agencies, and interest groups, but I know myself.' Khan emphasized that 'the victims' expectations from the law and their demands for equal application of the law everywhere in the world are what really matter to me.'

**ICC Prosecutor Defends Request for Netanyahu's Arrest Warrant**
The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, defended the request to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying, 'Should I wait until everyone dies?' in reference to the ongoing Israeli genocide in the Gaza Strip. Khan emphasized that Israeli officials 'are not above international law.' In May, Khan revealed that he had requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders, Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, and Mohammed Deif, on charges of 'war crimes,' 'crimes against humanity,' and 'genocide' since October 7, 2023. Hamas denied Khan's allegations and warned that any orders issued by the court against its leaders would 'contradict international charters and resolutions that gave the Palestinian people and all peoples under occupation the right to resist occupation in all forms.' Israeli officials have rejected Khan's move, stating that they do not recognize the court's jurisdiction and accused it of 'anti-Semitism.' Khan has repeatedly called for the court to take action against Israeli officials, saying, 'Why should I wait until everyone dies? If your father or mother or grandfather was taken as a hostage, would you really want me to wait? If your child or sister was torn to pieces, would you want me to wait?' Khan emphasized that all victims are equal and that he will show the same interest and love for the Palestinian child as he does for the Jewish child. He rejected accusations of anti-Semitism, saying, 'There are many insults, threats, and tricks that circulate between politicians, intelligence agencies, and interest groups, but I know myself.' Khan highlighted the killing of civilians in Gaza, saying, 'What would happen if I issued an arrest warrant for Hamas only, while there are between 30,000 to 40,000 killed and mothers suffering from miscarriage and hunger? Then it would be said: this court is not respected, it's in the pocket of the United States, Germany, and other powerful countries.'

**ICC Chief Prosecutor Defends Request for Netanyahu's Arrest Warrant**
The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, has defended his request for an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying 'Should I wait until everyone dies?' in reference to the ongoing Israeli genocide in the Gaza Strip since more than a year. Khan emphasized that Israeli officials 'are not above international law'. He requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders, Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, and Mohammed Deif, on charges of 'war crimes', 'crimes against humanity', and 'genocide' since October 7, 2023. Khan's request was met with rejection from Israeli officials, who claimed that the ICC has no jurisdiction over them and that it is 'anti-Semitic'. Khan rejected these claims, saying 'All victims are equal, I will show the same interest and love for the Palestinian child as I do for the Jewish child, this is a matter of equality before the law'. He also criticized the Israeli military for not holding its soldiers accountable for their actions in the occupied territories.

**The U.S. (with Israel) against the world must never happen**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of 'starvation of civilians' in the Gaza Strip and other 'inhumane acts.' However, the US and Israel have rejected these charges as 'outrageous' and 'antisemitic.' The US has even introduced a bill to sanction those who assist the ICC in investigating these cases. This move has sparked a fundamentalist attack on the legitimacy of the ICC, with some calling it a 'kangaroo court.' The US has a history of ambivalence towards international law and norms, and its unconditional support for Israel is putting the country on a trajectory that is 'unbelievably dangerous.' The ICC is staffed by professionals with integrity and dedication to evidence, and Israel can win these cases by crediting investigating the charges itself. The US should cooperate with the ICC while making clear that it recognizes its authority in principle.

**ICC Replaces Judge in Netanyahu Case, Potential Delay in Arrest Warrant Decision**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) announced that it will replace one of its judges due to health reasons, which may further delay a decision on the request to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The ICC's president stated that the judge, Romanian Judge Julia Motoc, requested to be replaced due to health reasons, and was immediately replaced by Slovenian Judge Bettina Holzer. The new judge will need time to familiarize herself with the case documents, which may lead to a delay in the decision on issuing arrest warrants. There is no specific time frame for the ICC to make a decision, but it has generally taken around 3 months to rule on previous requests for arrest warrants. The request to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders was submitted on May 20, 2024, and includes charges of 'war crimes, and crimes against humanity in violation of articles 8(2)(a)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), and (ix) of the Rome Statute'. According to the prosecutor's statement, the ICC's efforts to obtain arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity include 'starvation', 'willful killing', 'genocide and/or murder', 'intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population', 'persecution', 'inhumane acts', and 'intentionally inflicting severe physical or mental suffering, or causing great suffering or serious bodily or mental harm'.

The court stated that 'the decision to replace the Romanian judge in charge of the Gaza investigation was motivated by health reasons.' In May, the ICC requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, fearing he committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan explained that there were 'reasonable grounds to believe that the Israeli Prime Minister was criminally responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity.' He also requested an arrest warrant for Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant, accused of war crimes.

**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge in Netanyahu Case**
The International Criminal Court announced today that it has replaced one of the judges who will preside over a request from prosecutors to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a move that could lead to further delays in the case. The prosecutors requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three leaders of Hamas, in May, saying there were reasonable grounds to believe they had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. According to the court's president, the presiding judge, Romanian Judge Julia Motoc, requested to be replaced due to health reasons today, and was immediately replaced by Slovenian Judge Bettina Holzer. This replacement is expected to lead to further delays in issuing a decision on potential arrest warrants in the case, which involves the conflict in the Gaza Strip, as the new judge will need time to familiarize herself with all the case documents. There is no specific time limit for the court, but it has generally taken around three months to rule on requests for arrest warrants in previous cases. The case has already been delayed due to several rounds of legal challenges from Israel, which has questioned the court's jurisdiction.

The ICC is an independent judicial body that has jurisdiction over individuals accused of committing genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.

**International Criminal Court to Change Judge in Netanyahu Case**
The International Criminal Court announced on Friday that it will change one of the judges who will preside over the request of the prosecution to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The request was made by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, on May 20, to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant for their responsibility for 'war crimes and crimes against humanity' committed by the Israeli army in Gaza since October 7, 2023. The President of the Court stated that 'the President of the Court in that case, Judge Julia Motoc from Romania, requested a substitute for herself for health reasons today, and was immediately replaced by Judge Bettina Holzer from Slovenia.' This development is expected to further delay the Court's decision on the request to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant. The Israeli Channel 12 reported on Friday that the delay is likely to be longer due to Judge Holzer's need to review the legal details of the case. Israel submitted documents to the Court on September 20, challenging the request of the prosecutor, Karim Khan, to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu. The Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Oran Margaliot, stated that 'the State of Israel has submitted its official challenge to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the legality of the requests of the prosecutor to issue arrest warrants for the Prime Minister of Israel and the Minister of Defense.' The International Criminal Court is the only independent court in the world established to investigate the most serious crimes, including genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. However, it relies on member states to enforce arrest warrants and does not have a police force of its own.

**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge Who Was Preparing to Issue Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has replaced a judge who was preparing to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The ICC has the authority to prosecute individuals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The court has issued arrest warrants in the past, including one for Russian President Vladimir Putin for alleged war crimes. However, the ICC only intervenes when national authorities are unable or unwilling to stop crimes.

**Netanyahu Compares ICC Charges to Churchill's Criticism**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu compared the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor's request for an arrest warrant against him to Winston Churchill's criticism after World War II. Netanyahu said, 'This supposed symmetry is absurd. It's like Churchill was accused of committing war crimes alongside Nazi leaders at the same time after World War II. There can be no moral equivalence between a democracy that defends itself through legal means and a terrorist organization that applies terrorism.' The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, announced in May that he would request an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant. Khan stated that these individuals are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed since October 2023. He also requested an arrest warrant for Hamas leaders.

**1 year of Gaza genocide: Will Netanyahu soon be an accused war criminal?**
Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, are facing accusations of genocide and war crimes in Gaza. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is considering a case against the state of Israel, while the International Criminal Court (ICC) is deliberating on arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. According to Reed Brody, a renowned War Crimes Prosecutor, an ICC arrest warrant against Israeli leaders would be a 'huge development in international criminal law.' However, Brody notes that the ICC lacks an enforcement mechanism, and the warrants may not lead to the immediate capture of Netanyahu and Gallant. Nevertheless, the warrants would have significant importance, as they would label Netanyahu and Gallant as 'accused war criminals' and would be valid for an indefinite period. Brody also emphasizes that over 120 countries would be legally obliged to execute the arrest warrants if issued. Francis Boyle, a veteran human rights lawyer, calls for the formation of an 'International Criminal Tribunal for Israel' to hold Israeli leaders accountable for their crimes.

**Netanyahu Receives Cold Reception at UN General Assembly**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was met with an empty hall at the UN General Assembly, as the Turkish delegation led by Ambassador Ahmet Yıldız left the room before his speech. This move was seen as a protest against Netanyahu's presence at the UN, as he has been accused of committing war crimes in Gaza since October 7, 2023. The International Criminal Court has also issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu on charges of committing war crimes. The empty hall was a stark contrast to Netanyahu's speech, which was delivered to an almost deserted room. 'It was a great day for the Turkish delegation to show their support for the people of Gaza,' said a Turkish diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. 'We will not stand idly by while Netanyahu continues to commit atrocities in Gaza.'

**Netanyahu Believes International Arrest Warrants Will Be Issued Against Him Soon**
According to Israeli Channel 13, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believes that international arrest warrants will be issued against him and other officials soon by the International Criminal Court due to the war on Gaza. Sources revealed that Netanyahu ignored questions from the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in the Knesset regarding the possibility of firing Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Netanyahu stated in the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that 'Israel is going through fateful days', amidst the ongoing war on Gaza and the threat of a full-scale war with Lebanon. Israel continues to launch attacks on southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, as well as its recent attack on the southern suburbs of Beirut. 'Israel is going through fateful days,' Netanyahu said, 'Netanyahu believes that international arrest warrants will be issued against him and other officials soon by the International Criminal Court due to the war on Gaza.'

**Israel officially challenges ICC's arrest warrant request against Netanyahu**
Israel has officially challenged the International Criminal Court's (ICC) request for an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant over alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan requested the court issue arrest warrants in May, but Israel claims Khan failed to provide them with the opportunity to investigate the claims before proceeding. Khan's charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include 'starvation of civilians', 'extermination', and 'intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population'. The ICC is still weighing Khan's application, and Israel's challenge to the ICC's jurisdiction and the legality of the prosecutor's requests is ongoing.

**Netanyahu Criticizes UK Government Over Arms Ban and ICC Arrest Warrants**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticized the British government for sending 'confusing messages' and 'wrong decisions', accusing the Labour Party of 'undermining' Israel's ability to defend itself. The criticism comes after the UK suspended licenses for exporting arms to Israel, amid ongoing conflict with Hamas in Gaza. Netanyahu made the comments in an interview with the British Daily Mail, published on Wednesday, saying that the UK government had sent a 'disturbing message' to Hamas by suspending some arms licenses. He also criticized the International Criminal Court's expected arrest warrants, calling them 'ridiculous'. Netanyahu said, 'After the Hamas attack, the previous British government was clear in its support, and it's unfortunate that the current government sends confusing messages.' He added, 'They say Israel has the right to defend itself, but they undermine our ability to exercise this right by withdrawing from Britain's stance on the ridiculous charges brought by the International Criminal Court against Israel, and by preventing the sale of arms to Israel,' as the conflict with Hamas continues. The UK government had informed parliament that the 'difficult issue' of partial arms ban was a 'legal decision, not a political one.' However, the timing of the ban has been criticized, coming days after the fall of 6 Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Netanyahu has condemned this move, claiming that 'Israel is waging a just war with just means, taking unprecedented measures to separate civilians from danger, and fully complying with international law,' according to his statement. He added, 'In recent days, the new British government has suspended 30 arms licenses for Israel, just days after Hamas executed 6 Israeli hostages, sending a bad message to Hamas.' Netanyahu emphasized that 'these wrong decisions will not change Israel's determination to defeat Hamas.' He concluded, 'Just as Britain's brave stance against the Nazis is seen as crucial in defeating barbarism, history will also judge Israel's stance against Hamas and the Iranian terrorist axis. Israel will win this war and ensure our shared future.'

**Netanyahu is preparing himself for the inevitable end! They condemned before the International Criminal Court's decision came out.**
The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs 'mistakenly' condemned the International Criminal Court's (ICC) yet-to-be-issued arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The statement, which was published on the ministry's website and shared on social media, was quickly retracted after an official stated it was an error. The ICC has been evaluating the issue of issuing an arrest warrant against Netanyahu, Gallant, and Hamas Political Bureau Chief Yahya Sinwar for the past 4 months. Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan announced on May 20 that he had applied for an 'arrest warrant' against Netanyahu and Gallant, stating there are reasonable grounds to believe they bear criminal responsibility for 'war crimes and crimes against humanity' in the Gaza Strip since October 8, 2023. The ICC has not yet made a decision, but if an arrest warrant is issued, it could affect Netanyahu's travel plans during his visit to the United States for the United Nations General Assembly at the end of September.

**Israel Condemns International Criminal Court's Decision to Issue Arrest Warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant**
The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the International Criminal Court's decision to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The ministry later deleted the statement from its social media platforms, sparking speculation about the imminent issuance of the warrants. According to the ministry, the warrants may be issued before Netanyahu's trip to the United States to address the UN General Assembly. The ministry stated, 'The State of Israel rejects the shameful and humiliating decision of the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants against the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense of the State of Israel.' The ministry added, 'The decision to issue arrest warrants against leaders of a democratic state that defends itself against a terrorist attack is a sign that the court has lost its way and has become a political tool serving terrorist organizations in their war against democracies.' The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs usually prepares statements about international decisions in Israel before they are issued, indicating that Israel was aware of the decision. The Israeli Army Radio quoted a source in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying that the statement was a 'human error.' The United States is not a member of the International Criminal Court, but Netanyahu must leave directly from Tel Aviv to the US if he wants to travel. Netanyahu previously decided to travel directly to the US to address Congress in July, fearing the issuance of an arrest warrant against him. The International Criminal Court has 123 member states, and Netanyahu will be subject to arrest if he is detained there, whether the warrant is issued formally or secretly. The ICC's prosecutor, Karim Khan, announced that he had requested the court to issue arrest warrants against Netanyahu, Gallant, and other Palestinian leaders. The ICC's judges are reviewing the request.

**Netanyahu and Gallant Face War Crimes Charges at the International Criminal Court**
Kareem Khan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, has announced that he will issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes in Gaza. Khan has stated that there are 'reasonable grounds' to believe that Netanyahu and Gallant committed war crimes in the Gaza Strip. Despite the pressure and threats from Israeli officials and US lawmakers, Khan has insisted on pursuing the case. Netanyahu has attempted to counter this by asking the Israeli Attorney General to open a local investigation into the allegations, but this was rejected as a 'clearly transparent' maneuver that does not meet the requirements of the International Criminal Court. The case is expected to escalate into a global legal battle against the Israeli government, with several countries, including South Africa and Egypt, announcing their intention to join the case. The International Criminal Court is expected to issue a ruling in October, and the case is seen as a major blow to Netanyahu's government. The article also mentions a potential 'major crisis' that could be triggered by Netanyahu's actions, which could have far-reaching consequences for the region.

**Netanyahu Cannot Escape Punishment from a Legal Perspective, Says International Law Professor**
According to Dr. Salam Abdel-Samad, a professor of international law, the international judiciary, particularly the international criminal judiciary, is legally mandated to pursue individuals who violate international law, humanitarian law, and commit crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide. Abdel-Samad stated that there are two types of international courts: the International Court of Justice, which specializes in prosecuting states, and the International Criminal Court, which is an independent court with its own system, known as the Rome Statute, that prosecutes individuals who have committed crimes outlined in the Rome Statute. Abdel-Samad emphasized that the Israeli entity has committed genocide against the Palestinian people, even before October 7, referring to these crimes as state terrorism. He explained that the case brought by the South African state has taken its natural course, with hearings, the Israeli defense team attending, and the accused delivering their statement to the court, which has listened to these statements and examined the documents. Some reports indicate that the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is preparing to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as they ordered the Israeli army to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity. Abdel-Samad stressed that Netanyahu fears that the court will bring him to its chambers and issue a verdict against him, noting that issuing an arrest warrant against Netanyahu and its implementation would mean the end of the State of Israel, as it would mean bringing Israel, represented by its Prime Minister, to the court and issuing a verdict, at least imprisonment, and possibly execution. He concluded that Netanyahu cannot escape punishment from a legal perspective, but it appears that the United States and other active countries are preventing him from being punished, especially since the countries that must arrest Netanyahu are the ones he visits, and if those countries refuse to arrest him or he does not visit any country outside of Israel, the court's decision would be nothing more than a piece of paper.

**International Law Professor: Netanyahu's Trial by the International Criminal Court is a Real Possibility**
Dr. Salam Abdul Samad, a professor of international law, stated that international justice, particularly international criminal justice, is mandated by law according to the United Nations and international treaties to pursue states or individuals who violate international law, international humanitarian law, and commit crimes against humanity, terrorist crimes, and genocide. He added, 'There are two types of international justice: the International Court of Justice, which specializes in trying states, and the International Criminal Court, which is an independent court with its own system, known as the Rome System, that tries individuals who have committed crimes outlined in the Rome System.' Dr. Abdul Samad emphasized that the Israeli entity has committed genocide against the Palestinian people, even before October 7, referring to these crimes as state terrorism crimes. He explained that the case brought by South Africa has taken its natural course, with hearings, the Israeli defense team attending, and the defendant testifying before the court, which listened to his statements and examined the documents. Some reports indicate that the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is preparing an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as they ordered the Israeli army to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity. Dr. Abdul Samad stressed that Netanyahu fears that the court will bring him to its chambers and issue a verdict against him, stating, 'Issuing an arrest warrant against Netanyahu and then implementing it means the end of the State of Israel, as it would mean bringing Israel, represented by its prime minister, to the court and issuing a verdict, at least imprisonment, and possibly execution.' He added, 'Netanyahu cannot escape punishment from a legal perspective, but it seems that the United States and other influential countries are preventing him from receiving punishment, especially since the countries that must arrest Netanyahu are the ones he visits, and if those countries refuse to arrest him or he does not visit any country outside of Israel, the court's decision will be nothing more than a piece of paper.'

**Netanyahu Seeks 'Scapegoat' to Avoid Indictment in International Criminal Court**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant are facing a possible indictment by the International Criminal Court in The Hague for 'war crimes' and 'crimes against humanity' in the war on Gaza. In an attempt to evade the court, Netanyahu and Justice Minister Yariv Levin have tried to persuade the government's chief prosecutor, Gali Baharav-Miara, to open a criminal investigation against senior generals and politicians, in order to claim that Israel is capable of conducting its own investigations and does not need international intervention. However, Baharav-Miara has refused, stating that there are no sufficient legal grounds for such an investigation. Meanwhile, Netanyahu has been searching for a 'scapegoat' to take the blame for the allegations, and has suggested that a few individuals be investigated for a short period of time without any real charges being brought against them. If the Israeli court refuses to issue an arrest warrant, the case will be closed. In a separate development, Netanyahu has announced that Israel will work with its neighbors to 'create a strong obstacle to prevent smuggling' and ensure the safety of the border with Jordan. However, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry has condemned Netanyahu's 'provocative' visit to the occupied territories. Additionally, the head of the Israeli intelligence unit 8200, Yossi Sariel, has resigned due to 'dereliction of duty' during the 'Tofan Al-Aqsa' operation in October. The unit is responsible for deciphering codes and analyzing information. The UNRWA Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, has stated that the 'pointless killing' in Gaza will not end, and that it is time to stop the shooting and hold someone accountable. He was responding to an Israeli attack on a UNRWA school in the Gaza Strip that killed 14 people, including 6 UNRWA staff members. The World Health Organization has announced that a quarter of the people injured in the war are suffering from 'life-changing injuries', with many requiring 'huge' prosthetics and rehabilitation services. The organization has stated that at least 22,500 people will need rehabilitation services now and in the coming years. The UNRWA representative in Gaza, Rick Brennan, has stated that the 'huge increase in rehabilitation needs is happening as the destruction of the health system continues'. The organization has estimated that there are between 13,455 and 17,550 'serious limb injuries'. The World Health Organization has also stated that it is 'confident' that the massive vaccination campaign against polio in Gaza has achieved its goal of reaching over 90% of children under the age of 10.

**Israel Prepares for Possible Arrest Warrants from International Criminal Court**
According to Israeli media, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has requested his legal advisor to open a criminal investigation to prevent his arrest by the International Criminal Court. The Israeli Channel 12 reported that there is a high probability that the International Criminal Court will issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Galant, and it cannot be prevented. Netanyahu and the Minister of Justice have asked the government's legal advisor to open a criminal investigation to prevent arrest warrants. This comes after the Israeli newspaper 'Yedioth Ahronoth' reported that the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, has requested urgent arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Galant due to their alleged war crimes in the Gaza Strip. Khan is reportedly seeking a speedy decision on the arrest warrants, and the estimates are that he requested the warrants before Netanyahu's speech at the United Nations.

**International Criminal Court Requests Arrest Warrants for Netanyahu and Hamas Leaders**
The Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, has requested the immediate issuance of arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Muhammad Deif. Khan stated that this is necessary to prevent the continuation of the investigation and 'due to the deterioration of the situation in Israel and the continuation of crimes', according to Tengrinews.kz. Khan has accused Netanyahu and Gallant of using hunger as a weapon of war against the residents of the Gaza Strip. The International Criminal Court has previously decided to terminate the trial against Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh due to his death. However, the court has not yet made a decision to terminate the case against Muhammad Deif, who was also targeted by Israel, as Khan lacks sufficient evidence to confirm Deif's death and withdraw the charges against him. The request for arrest warrants was submitted by Khan on May 21. All the above-mentioned individuals are suspected of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.
