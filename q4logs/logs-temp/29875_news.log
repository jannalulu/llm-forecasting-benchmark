**Putin Rushes to Regain Control of Kursk Region Before Trump's Inauguration**
Russian President Vladimir Putin is rushing to regain control of the Kursk region before the inauguration of US President Donald Trump on January 20, 2025. He has deployed thousands of soldiers for this purpose. Russian and North Korean forces are preparing for an attack in the Kursk region, which is seen as a threat to Ukraine. Western diplomats are concerned about the rapid seizure of territories by Russia before Trump's inauguration. Ukrainian and American officials expect an attack in the Kursk region and the involvement of North Korean troops. According to estimates by NATO allies, Putin aims to regain control over territories lost during Ukraine's advance by January 20. British military intelligence predicts that Russia will intensify drone attacks on Ukrainian positions, including from new launch sites near the border. Approximately 12,000 North Korean conscripts are expected to join the fighting in the Kursk region under a military support agreement between Russia and North Korea, signed this year. Ukrainian analysts believe that the Kremlin may try to use this massive counterattack in the Kursk region to further advance into the northeastern Sumy region of Ukraine. Currently, Russia has regained control over about half of the territory previously occupied by Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region. The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, General Alexander Syrskyi, reported that Ukrainian positions are being attacked by 'tens of thousands of enemy soldiers from the most powerful Russian assault units.' Western diplomats are concerned that Putin will try to quickly seize territories before Trump's inauguration to strengthen Russia's position in potential peace talks.

**Russia Expands Military Offensive on Ukraine Border**
Russia has intensified its military operations to retake the western region of Kursk, on the border with Ukraine, according to Ukrainian army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, on Monday (11 Nov 2024). This move comes a day after the New York Times reported on the mobilization of 50,000 Russian soldiers, including North Korean troops, for an attack on the border. The NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) had already confirmed in October the presence of North Korean soldiers in the conflict. Russia, however, has not confirmed these reports. On November 2, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reaffirmed their bilateral commitment to implement agreements on military assistance between the two countries. They met in Moscow. Ukraine's incursion into Kursk in August 2022 marked a significant offensive in Russian territory in response to the Russian invasion six months earlier. Russia, in turn, advanced slowly in eastern Ukraine, capturing villages in the Donbass region. Russian President Vladimir Putin promised retaliation against Ukraine for the invasion of Kursk, near the border between the two countries. Kiev controlled an area of over 1,000 km² in Kursk. Approximately 121,000 people had to be evacuated from the region.

**How the Ukraine-Russia War Became a Global Conflict**
The war between Russia and Ukraine, which began in February 2022, has become a global conflict, with millions of refugees fleeing Ukraine, soaring fuel and fertilizer prices, and other far-reaching consequences. As the conflict has dragged on, its international repercussions have expanded, with more countries becoming involved, directly or indirectly. Ukraine has received military and financial aid from multiple European countries, while Russia has strengthened its ties with North Korea, which has sent soldiers to be trained by the Russian military. The diplomatic landscape is also clear-cut, with Western countries viewing any country that does not support Ukraine or sanction Russia as 'friendly' with Putin. However, no international position is powerful enough to impose a ceasefire. Many countries have committed to playing mediator roles, such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, due to their multiple interests in the conflict.

**Trump and Ukraine: what Russia wants, what Trump could do**
Russia's objectives in Ukraine include keeping the territories it has annexed, demanding formal recognition of these annexations, and establishing firm borders. Russia also wants guarantees of Russian language and culture, protection of the Russian Orthodox church, and a more friendly government in Kyiv. Additionally, Russia will demand that Ukraine be largely demilitarized, that NATO get out of Ukraine, and that all sanctions be lifted. In exchange, Russia will facilitate Ukrainian trade and commerce. The article suggests that any successful deal would work better if it was accomplished in stages, and that the US should consider reducing its NATO commitment to avoid further conflict with Russia.

**Russia Controls Approximately 18% of Ukrainian Territory: Study**
Russia has made significant gains in Ukraine, expanding its control over 478 km² since October, according to a report by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). This is the largest monthly territorial gain since March 2022. The recent advances have surpassed those of August and September, which had already marked significant changes in the front line, with territories gained of 477 km² and 459 km², respectively. Much of these conquests have focused on the Donetsk region, a critical area for logistics and territorial control, where Russian forces have secured approximately 324 km² in October. This illustrates the serious difficulties faced by Ukrainian forces, which are struggling to resist a Russian army with more personnel and better equipment. Since the start of the war in February 2022, Russia has accumulated around 67,192 km² of Ukrainian territory, including the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and previously controlled Donbás territories. In total, Moscow controls approximately 18.2% of Ukraine's total territory. Meanwhile, Russia has intensified its deterrence rhetoric by conducting strategic nuclear exercises under the direct supervision of President Vladimir Putin. These maneuvers, which include ballistic and cruise missile tests, as well as land, sea, and air strategic force simulations, send a direct message about Russia's military power and its willingness to consider extreme measures in the conflict. With time working in favor of their advances on the front, Volodymyr Zelensky faces increasingly greater challenges to slow down the expansion and consolidate international support, as said, 'the time is playing in favor of our advances on the front'.

**Russia to Double Payments for Teachers Moving to Occupied Territories**
The Russian Ministry of Education has proposed expanding the 'Zemsky Uchitel' program to temporarily occupied Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as partially occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. According to the ministry, Russian teachers who move to work in rural areas and small towns in these regions will receive a one-time compensation payment of 2 million rubles. This is double the current payment of 1 million rubles for teachers who move to rural areas under the 'Zemsky Uchitel' program. The project has been prepared and is expected to come into effect on January 1, 2025. This move comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin issued an order providing social guarantees to Russians who move to temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories. Additionally, it has been reported that Russian occupiers plan to 'passportize' all residents over 14 years old on temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories by the end of 2024. It is also worth noting that Russian occupiers continue to recruit young people on occupied territories under the guise of patriotic education.

**Russia to Increase Compensation for Teachers Moving to Occupied Territories in Ukraine**
The Russian government plans to increase the one-time compensation payment for Russian teachers who agree to move to occupied territories in Ukraine to 2 million rubles. The program 'Zemsky teacher' is expected to be expanded to Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as partially occupied territories in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. According to a statement, 'pedagogues who move to work in rural areas and small towns in Donetsk and Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions will have their one-time compensation payment increased to 2 million rubles.' The Russian Ministry of Education has prepared a draft resolution for this purpose. Currently, Russian teachers who move to rural areas and small towns under the 'Zemsky teacher' program receive a one-time compensation payment of 1 million rubles, while those who move to the Far Eastern Federal District receive 2 million rubles. The resolution is expected to come into effect on January 1, 2025. This move follows a decree by Russian President Vladimir Putin, which provides social guarantees for Russians who move to occupied territories in Ukraine. Additionally, it has been reported that Russian occupiers aim to 'passportize' all residents aged 14 and above on occupied territories in Ukraine by the end of 2024. It is worth noting that Russian occupiers are continuing their large-scale campaign to recruit young people to occupied territories in Ukraine under the guise of patriotism.

**Russian Analyst Predicts End of Battles in Kursk Oblast and New Regions by Summer 2025**
Russian political analyst Sergey Markov predicts that the battles for territories in Kursk Oblast and new Russian regions will end 'approximately' by summer 2025. Markov made this estimate after calculating the pace of Russian forces taking control of the territories and accounting for the remaining Ukrainian-controlled lands. He also considered the geometric progression of the Russian advance. According to Markov, 'We need not only arithmetic progression, that is, linear speed of advance. But also geometric progression, that is, the speed of advance and acceleration of advance. But at the first estimate, with geometric progression, I think the complete liberation will be approximately by summer 2025,' Markov wrote in his blog. Markov noted that numbers are important because they are objective, but he did not provide the full formula for his calculations. In contrast, military correspondent Alexander Kotz previously estimated that the special military operation in Ukraine will not end in the fall, but will be completed no earlier than January 2025.

**Russian Forces Advance Significantly in Eastern Ukraine, Capturing Record Territory**
According to WELT reporter Christoph Vanner, Russian forces have advanced significantly in eastern Ukraine, capturing a record amount of territory in October, the largest since March 2022. The majority of these gains, two-thirds, were made in the Donetsk region. The Russian army has advanced 478 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory since the start of October, surpassing the 477 and 459 square kilometers gained in August and September, respectively. The Ukrainian army is in a disadvantageous position due to the numerical superiority of the Russian army. The last time Russian forces made such significant gains was in March 2022, when they advanced towards Kyiv. The total area occupied by Russia since the start of 2024 is 2,660 square kilometers, bringing the total area under their control to 18.2% of Ukraine's territory, including Crimea, which was annexed in 2014, and the Donbas regions, which were already under separatist control. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces confirmed that the situation in the Donetsk region is tense, with 149 battles reported in the past day, including 31 attacks repelled by Ukrainian defenders on the Pokrovsky direction.

**Russia's alleged plan to take control of Ukrainian territory**
A recent article by the German newspaper Bild claims that Russia plans to take control of a significant portion of Ukrainian territory, including major industrial cities, within the next two years. According to the article, the plan involves the 'deindustrialization' of Ukraine by seizing its industrial base, including the 'metallic-coal belt' of eastern Ukraine. The article cites German intelligence sources, who claim that Russia aims to take control of the Dnepropetrovsk and Zaporozhye regions, as well as the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, by the end of 2025. The article notes that this plan is consistent with Ukraine's historical goal of building a 'great agrarian empire', but argues that this is not a viable economic strategy. The article also notes that Ukraine's metal and coal industry has been a key factor in the country's economy, and that the loss of these industries would have significant consequences for Ukraine's economy. The article concludes that the German intelligence sources' claims are plausible, but that it is unclear whether Russia actually plans to implement this strategy.

**Russia Sets New Record in Special Operation Zone**
Russian forces have advanced 478 square kilometers in October in the special operation zone, setting a record since 2022. According to AFP, 'Russia advanced 478 sq. km in Ukraine in October, which is a record since 2022.' The Russian army has made significant territorial gains, exceeding their own results in August and September 2024, when 477 and 459 square kilometers were controlled respectively. 'By October 27, Russian forces had taken control of a larger territory than in previous months of this year, following significant shifts on the front line, especially in eastern Ukraine in the Pokrovsk area,' AFP notes. Since the start of military operations on February 24, 2022, the Russian army has expanded its control zone on Ukrainian territory to 67,192 square kilometers. This expansion also includes an increase in controlled territories on the northern front, in the Kupyansk area. The Russian forces are currently engaged in fierce battles in Kurakhovo in the DNR and are taking steps to encircle the Ukrainian forces in this area. According to military expert Andrei Marochko, the capture of Pokrovsk will open the way for Russian soldiers to take control of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, leaving only a small distance to the western borders of the DNR.

**Russia Occupies Largest Territory in Ukraine Since 2022**
Russia's military has made significant gains in the Ukraine, occupying nearly 480 square kilometers of territory since October 1. This is the largest territorial gain in a single month since the early weeks of the Russian invasion in the spring of 2022, according to data from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). The majority of the gains, two-thirds, have been made in the Donetsk region, where Russian forces are closing in on the strategic city of Pokrovsk from the south and east. The Ukrainian army is struggling on the eastern front due to the numerical and military superiority of the Russian forces. This is the first time since March 2022 that Russian forces have made such significant gains, and it brings the total occupied territory to 2660 square kilometers since January 1, 2024. Including the annexed Crimea and the Donbass regions, which were already under Kremlin control before the invasion, Russia now occupies approximately 18.2% of Ukraine's territory.

**Russia Continues to Advance in Ukraine, Capturing 478 Square Kilometers of Territory**
Russia has continued its advance in Ukraine, capturing 478 square kilometers of territory since the start of October, the largest gain in a month since March 2022, according to a new analysis based on data from the American Institute for the Study of War. In the Donetsk region, which includes this important logistics center, Russia has achieved two-thirds of its October gains, 324 square kilometers. Russian forces are now just kilometers away from the city, approaching from the south and east. Since months, Ukraine has been losing territory in eastern Ukraine to Russian forces, who are more numerous and better equipped, despite suffering heavy losses. In October, Russia captured more than 40 square kilometers near the city of Kupyansk, which it had occupied at the beginning of the war and then lost to Ukraine in September 2022. Russian forces have made similar territorial gains in March 2022, when they expanded their operations northward towards Kyiv. By the end of 2023, Russia had captured 584 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory. Since the start of 2024, Russia has controlled more than 2660 square kilometers, slightly less than the area of Moscow. By October 27, Russia had captured 67,192 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory since the start of the war. With the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the Donbas region, which was controlled by separatists before the Russian attack, Moscow now controls around 18.2% of Ukraine. 'The Russian military has made significant gains in Ukraine, but the Ukrainian military has also shown resilience and determination,' said a spokesperson for the Institute for the Study of War. 'The conflict is far from over, and the outcome is still uncertain.'

**'Forced Passports' and Social Benefits: Occupation Authorities' New Tool of Coercion**
The Russian occupation authorities are using blackmail to force Ukrainian citizens in occupied territories to obtain Russian passports, threatening to revoke their social benefits, including access to life-saving insulin for diabetic patients. According to the Center for National Resistance, starting from January 1, 2025, Ukrainian citizens who do not obtain a Russian passport will lose their right to social benefits. The occupation authorities are openly applying pressure, warning the most vulnerable categories of population that they will be deprived of necessary assistance. This creates a real threat to the lives of many patients, as humanitarian aid to occupied territories remains limited. The Kremlin has announced its intention to complete mass passportization of all occupied territories by the end of 2024, but this process is facing significant challenges due to passive resistance from the population and failures by local collaborators. The occupation authorities are intensifying pressure on residents, threatening to deprive them not only of access to medicines, but also of social payments, pensions, medical services, and benefits. In this way, the enemy is using blackmail as a tool of coercion, trying to create the illusion of 'voluntary' acceptance of Russian citizenship. This approach shows that the occupying power is not interested in the well-being of the population, but rather seeks to strengthen its control over the occupied territories. The revocation of the right to social benefits has become a weapon in the hands of the occupiers, aimed at the most vulnerable segments of the population, leaving them with minimal chances of survival without integration into the Russian system. As said by the Center for National Resistance, 'This is a clear example of the occupiers' disregard for the lives and well-being of the Ukrainian people.'

**Belarusian Border Fully Controlled, Intelligence Units Monitor Situation**
The border with Belarus is fully controlled, with all intelligence units actively monitoring the situation. According to Andriy Demchenko, a representative of the State Border Service, the situation has not changed over the past period. 'We fully control the entire border with Belarus, from Volyn to Chernihiv. We continue to strengthen our capabilities along the border in terms of engineering and fortification - to prevent the passage of equipment if there are any changes in the situation,' Demchenko emphasized. He also noted that intelligence units are actively monitoring the situation on the other side of the border, deep into Belarusian territory, in order to understand how the situation may change. This comes as Russia has been trying to push Ukrainian defense forces back to the border in the Kursk region for two weeks. Demchenko discussed the impact of Ukrainian Armed Forces' actions on the border, the strength of the border, and other related issues. Meanwhile, Belarus has announced presidential elections for January 26, 2025, and Russia has promised to send troops to Belarus in case of protests against the falsification of the will of the Belarusian people. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has also stated that he wants to participate in negotiations on the war in Ukraine, claiming that 'issues related to Belarus' will be resolved during these negotiations and that he will not allow them to be resolved without the participation of Minsk. Lukashenko also made veiled threats against unnamed forces, including Belarusian opposition members, who allegedly want to 'cut off half of the country' and that the West is afraid of Lukashenko's participation in negotiations, as he 'cannot be broken or bent'.

**Russian Forces Expand Control Zone in Zaporizhzhia Region**
Russian forces have expanded their control zone north and east of the village of Levadnoe on the Vremevsky direction of the Zaporizhzhia front line, according to Vladimir Rogov, chairman of the commission on sovereignty of the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation. 'The Russian army has expanded the control zone north and east of Levadnoe, gradually advancing and developing operational success on three sectors of the Vremevsky direction,' Rogov said. This advance will allow Russian forces to take control of the supply and troop transfer route between the Orehovsky and Vremevsky directions of the Zaporizhzhia front. The Zaporizhzhia region, which is located in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River, became part of Russia after a referendum in September 2022. However, Ukraine does not recognize the results of the referendum and continues to shell the territory. Currently, more than 70% of the Zaporizhzhia region is under Russian control, while the remaining part, including the regional center, the city of Zaporizhzhia, is held by Ukrainian forces.

**Russia to Maintain Control Over Significant Portion of Ukrainian Territory, According to Hill**
According to the Hill publication, Russia will maintain control over a significant portion of Ukrainian territory regardless of the outcome of the conflict. The authors of the article believe that the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) will not be able to retake the territories occupied by Russia through force. Instead, the conflict will end with negotiations between the two countries. As the authors note, 'The harsh truth is that, whenever the fighting stops, Russia will undoubtedly leave behind a part of Ukrainian territory, and it is likely to be a significant part.' This assessment is consistent with previous statements by Russian officials, including Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who noted that in the event of successful negotiations in Istanbul in April 2022, Ukraine would remain within its 1991 borders, excluding Crimea. The head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, Sergey Naryshkin, has also stated that Ukraine has begun a terrorist war against Russia, which it has no chance of winning.

**Loss of Uugledar Allows Russian Forces to Expand Logistics on Southern Front**
The loss of the city of Uugledar to the Ukrainian Armed Forces has allowed Russian forces to significantly expand their logistics on the southern front, according to political analyst Alexander Kovalov. 'If we don't control this, the Russians will be able to launch trains soon, and the logistical support for the 'Dnipro' and 'Vostok' groups will begin,' Kovalov said in an interview with 'RBK-Ukraine'. The expert noted that the main problem with the loss of Uugledar is that the enemy's logistics will be significantly expanded. 'Ugledar was a key logistical point in the region, and now the Russians will be able to control the routes through Vovnokhova,' Kovalov explained. Russian forces have entered Uugledar from the west and south, and the Telegram channel 'Voyn DV' has published a video showing a Russian flag raised over a high-rise building in the city. Uugledar is located 60 kilometers southwest of Donetsk in the DNR and is considered a crucial logistical point in the region.

**Russia to Increase Military Spending to Continue Ukraine Offensive**
Russia plans to significantly increase its military spending in 2025 to continue its offensive in Ukraine. By 2025, military spending will represent more than double the investment in social policy. In contrast, Ukraine, which relies heavily on financial and military support from Western countries, plans to allocate over 60% of its budget next year to defense and security (approximately $54 billion or R$ 294 billion). Russian leader Vladimir Putin acknowledged that the February 2022 offensive in Ukraine was a 'fateful event', but claimed it was necessary to protect Russian-speaking inhabitants of the 'New Russia' - a Moscow-led integration project for southern and eastern Ukraine - from the 'neonazi dictatorship' in Kiev, according to him. Ukraine denies any policy of oppression against ethnically Russian or Russian-speaking people, who continue to be the native language of many Ukrainians. Putin had previously annexed the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in 2022, which are only partially controlled by Moscow and whose adhesion to Russia was voted in referendums that neither Kiev nor the international community recognizes.

**Russia Strengthens Filtration Measures in Crimea, Blocks Entire Regions**
Russian occupiers in Crimea have strengthened their filtration measures, blocking entire regions and thoroughly checking local residents. According to the Center for National Resistance, these measures were initiated to identify 'unreliable' elements on the occupied peninsula. The operation is being carried out under the guise of military exercises 'Bar's-Krim'. Local collaborator Sergei Aksyonov called on Crimeans to participate in the exercises. 'Such raids are regularly conducted on temporarily occupied territories. Recently, control over all civilians planning to leave the temporarily occupied Kherson region has been tightened. This applies to Ukrainians who have not exchanged their passports for a Russian document,' the statement reads. The Russians are preparing to build a network of concentration camps on temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories. From January 2025, pressure will be increased on citizens who have not received a Russian passport or have not obtained a residence permit or refugee status, the Center for National Resistance reports.

Russian occupiers in Crimea have tightened their filtration measures, blocking entire areas and thoroughly checking local residents, according to the Center for National Resistance. These measures, disguised as military exercises 'Bar's Crimea', aim to identify 'unreliable' individuals. Sergey Aksenov, the local 'governor', has called on Crimean residents to cooperate with the exercises. 'Such raids are regularly conducted on temporarily occupied territories.

**Putin Installs ATMs in Occupied Territories, Expanding Russian Control**
Russian state-controlled banks are expanding their presence in disputed Ukrainian territories, despite economic instability and low purchasing power. Sberbank operates 48 branches and 130 ATMs in these regions, with plans for further expansion. VTB Bank also plans to open branches in Mariupol before the end of the year. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia has led to the control of four regions: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. Although Russia does not fully control these territories, it continues to make efforts to capture more. PSB Bank was the first to establish a significant presence, with almost 400 locations in Donetsk and Luhansk. The operations of the banks are part of a broader strategy to integrate these regions into the Russian economy. Schools are reviewing their textbooks, and even banks like Sberbank have opened an office in Crimea, despite suspending their activities there in 2014. President Putin encourages companies to operate in these regions, minimizing the risks of sanctions. However, many companies are hesitant due to low purchasing power and high risk. A source from the retail sector told the 'Financial Times' that sensible companies would not go there. Even in Crimea, few companies are active. Western sanctions are likely to deter companies from operating in these regions. Despite economic challenges, Russian companies can still position themselves as 'patriotic companies' by operating in occupied territories. The Black Star Burger restaurant chain, for example, plans to open branches in Mariupol and Kherson. Last year, it was reported that around 2,500 companies were active in the new territories, although some may have been confiscated by Russia. High Risk, Low Reward The occupation of Ukrainian territories presents businesses with high risks and few rewards. Companies are reluctant to invest due to the volatile political environment and low purchasing power. Protests and violence in these regions often disrupt operations, making them unattractive to foreign investors. However, Russian banks see an opportunity to expand their presence in these regions and strengthen their control over the local economy. They can offer loans and financial services to local companies, creating a dependence on Russian banks. But the long-term sustainability of these companies under international sanctions and economic instability remains uncertain. In recent years, Russia has made efforts to integrate these territories into its economy. This includes reviewing school textbooks and encouraging companies to operate in the region. Despite challenges, many Russian companies are willing to take the risk, considering it a way to demonstrate their patriotism. However, the political and economic situation in these regions remains unstable and volatile. The long-term impact of the occupation on Ukraine's economy and international relations is still to be seen. Companies operating in these regions will have to navigate the complex political landscape and adapt to changing circumstances to survive and thrive.

**Russia Strengthens Control Over Occupied Ukrainian Territories**
Russia is strengthening its control over the occupied Ukrainian territories by opening branches of its largest state-owned banks, such as 'Sberbank' and 'VTB', despite Western sanctions. President Putin is encouraging Russian companies to operate in the occupied territories, stating that the sanctions have already occurred and there is nothing to be afraid of. The Central Bank of Russia has extended the limit on foreign cash withdrawals until March 2025, with a limit of $10,000, amidst restrictions on dollar and euro transfers. According to a report by the British Financial Times, Russia is working to consolidate its grip on the territories it has recently occupied in Ukraine, by opening branches of its largest state-owned banks in cities such as Mariupol. While many brands are still avoiding these areas due to fear of Western sanctions and the risks of doing business in a war zone, the largest Russian state-owned banks, such as 'Sberbank' and 'VTB', have begun to respond to this call. Sources within Sberbank, which was subject to Western sanctions in 2022, told the Financial Times that it has opened 130 automated cash machines and 48 locations in what Moscow describes as 'new areas' in eastern and southern Ukraine, including opening full branches of some Russian banks. Sberbank has already served nearly 70,000 people and plans to expand its operations there. President Putin told state-owned companies this year that 'there is nothing to be afraid of' when establishing stores and branches in the occupied territories. Putin told financial leaders: 'You must start going to these areas with greater enthusiasm and start working there... everything you were afraid of has already happened. So what should we be afraid of?' Moscow has announced that the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine are part of Russia constitutionally after being occupied by force. However, Russian forces do not fully control all the territory they claim, and they continue to try to capture more areas recognized internationally as Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraine launched a surprise attack on the Russian region of Kursk last month, capturing large areas of land, as both sides seek to maximize their territorial gains before entering any peace talks.
