**Once-big Portland tech employer lays off dozens**
New Relic, a software maker based in San Francisco, appears to be cutting its workforce again, with up to 150 people potentially affected, according to social media posts by affected employees. This is at least the second round of layoffs for the company this year, and comes one year after it completed a deal to go private. The company has been expanding its office in Bengaluru, India, which will have more than 300 employees, and has quadrupled its headcount in India since the start of this year. New Relic's Portland office, which was once a major hub for the company, has been shrinking in recent years, with the company cutting its footprint in the US Bancorp Tower. 'The expansion in India is key to the company’s growth strategy,' said New Relic executives, noting that many of its own customers have growing teams in that part of the world.

**Tequila Works Asks Employees to Work for Free After Declaring Bankruptcy**
Tequila Works, a video game development studio, has asked its remaining employees to work for free after declaring bankruptcy. The studio had previously announced layoffs in October, citing a need to restructure and focus on a single game. However, the studio has now entered administration and its founders, Raúl Rubio and Luz Sancho, have left the company. The new CEO, Térence Mosca, has taken over and has asked employees to continue working on projects, despite the uncertainty of their pay. The studio had received funding from Tencent in 2022 to develop these projects, but the funding has been suspended. Tequila Works has created several notable games, including RIME and The Sexy Brutale, and has been a part of the Riot Forge label. The news comes as other companies in the gaming industry, such as PlayStation, Netflix, and Ubisoft, are also undergoing restructuring and layoffs.

**Two More Xbox Games to Close Their Servers Before the End of the Year**
This year will be remembered for several things in the gaming industry, including the number of layoffs and the high quality of games like Silent Hill 2 Remake and Metaphor: ReFantazio. However, it will also be remembered for the number of games that will close their servers on Xbox. SEGA has announced that it will close the servers of up to 12 games this month, and Electronic Arts has decided to close access to several games in the Battlefield series. Now, it has been revealed that two more games will close their servers on Xbox before the end of the year. Two games will close their servers on Xbox on December 31. Friday the 13th: The Game will no longer be available for purchase by the end of 2023, and will be completely unplayable by the end of 2024. The game will stop being available on December 31, 2024, and its servers will be completely closed, preventing any player from accessing it. Another game, NBA 2K23, will also see its online services come to an end on the last day of the year, despite being only a couple of years old. 'It's not uncommon for sports games to take these decisions as new annual releases come to the market,' said a spokesperson for the game. 'However, it's not usual for games with only a couple of years behind them to take this step.'

**Dropbox Lays Off 20% of Workforce Amid 'Period of Transition'**
Dropbox has laid off 20% of its workforce, affecting 528 employees. The decision was made by CEO Drew Houston, who stated that the company is going through a 'period of transition'. The goal is to make cuts in areas where Dropbox has 'invested too much' and restructure the team in a more 'flat and efficient' way. This move comes after a similar layoff in April last year, where 500 employees were let go to focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Houston emphasized the need for 'greater urgency, more aggressive investment, and decisive action' in the rapidly changing market. He also took responsibility for the decision and expressed his regret for the affected employees. According to Tech Crunch, Dropbox will pay between $63 and $68 million in cash for severance packages and benefits, to be paid between the fourth quarter of 2024 and early 2025.

**Netflix’s gaming studio Team Blue is officially kaput amid layoffs**
Netflix's gaming studio, Team Blue, has been shut down amid layoffs, just two years after its unveiling. The studio, which had big-name hires like former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny and Halo Infinite creative lead Joseph Staten, had ambitious plans for original gaming content. However, it seems that Netflix is shifting its focus to games based on its own IPs, such as Squid Game and Virgin River Christmas. In an October investors call, co-CEO Gregory Peters mentioned that Netflix is 'excited about games based on Netflix IPs.' The studio's closure comes as a surprise, given the big-name hires and the studio's potential for original gaming content. Netflix confirmed the Gamefile report but declined further comment.

**What the heck happened at Netflix gaming?**
Netflix has shut down its top-tier game studio, Team Blue, and laid off its executives, including former Overwatch leader Chacko Sonny, former Halo exec Joseph Staten, and God of War art director Rafael Grassetti. The studio was working on a new AAA multiplatform game, but its fate is now uncertain. This move is a setback for Netflix's ambitions to be a significant force in the video game industry, which it has been building up over the past three years with a large catalog of mobile games. As Staten said in 2023, 'Making video games is a lot harder than it looks from the outside.'

**Netflix just closed its AAA game studio**
Netflix has closed its AAA game development studio, Team Blue, after just two years of operation. The studio was established to create big-budget, multi-device, AAA games, but it appears that Netflix is pulling back on game development. Instead, the company is focusing on producing lower-lift mobile games, such as those based on its TV shows. Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said, 'We're excited about games based on Netflix IPs,' and fellow co-CEO Ted Sarandos stated, 'Our aim here is to always have a very steady drumbeat of great new TV shows and films, and games for our members to watch throughout the year.' The closure of Team Blue comes as the video game industry is experiencing a record number of layoffs, with over 10,000 job cuts in the first half of 2024 alone.

**Netflix shutters its only triple-A studio, loses major industry hires**
Netflix has closed its internal game studio, Team Blue, which was working on a triple-A title. The studio was founded in 2022 and was based in Los Angeles. As a result of the closure, the company has lost several major industry hires, including Chacko Sonny, Joseph Staten, and Rafael Grassetti. According to Game File, Team Blue was working on a 'big-budget multi-device strategy' at the time of its closure. Netflix has several internal studios, including one in Helsinki, which appear to be intact. However, the company has reportedly made other layoffs in its games division. Netflix has also shifted its games strategy this year, taking a mobile-first approach to games launches, as stated by Leanne Loombe, VP of external games. 'We want to take a mobile-first approach to games launches,' Loombe said. 'Our subscribers appear to favor short, 'snackable' mobile games.'

Netflix has shut down its AAA studio, Team Blue, led by former Overwatch, Halo, and GoW developers. The studio, which opened in 2022, was working on an unannounced multiplatform AAA game.

This move comes amid a shakeup in Netflix's gaming division, which recently cut around 35 jobs.
