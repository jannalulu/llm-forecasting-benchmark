**Another Warning That Illinois Temps are About to Take a Deep Dive**
The National Weather Service in Chicago has echoed a previous warning that temperatures in Illinois are about to take a deep dive. Daytime highs are expected to be in the 20's and lows in the teens, with a possibility of single digit lows overnight due to expected snowfall around Thanksgiving. The weather service has placed southern Missouri in the slight risk area as well. The author of the warning, who has a thick skin, predicts that few will find this funny in about a week, as late November and early December are expected to feel more like their normal, possibly even colder, selves.

**Chicago weather: Chilly and possibly wet for Thanksgiving**
Chicagoans can expect a chilly Thanksgiving holiday weekend with a chance of rain or snow overnight Wednesday. Temperatures on Thanksgiving Day are predicted to be in the upper 30s, with a high of 40 degrees. National Weather Service meteorologist Ricky Castro said, 'It's a little too early to say' whether there will be precipitation, but there is 'pretty high confidence' that the area will be in a colder pattern for Thanksgiving. The week of Thanksgiving will bring a 'return to colder conditions' after milder weather on Sunday, with a cold front expected to come through the Chicago area on Monday. A 'pretty cold start to December' appears likely, with even colder air coming into the region, and 'occasional chances for accumulating snow' expected. 'It's been a warm fall, but it does not look like that's going to be the case as we move to close out November into December, definitely,' Castro said.

**NOAA releases new outlook for winter 2024-25. What it means for Chicago area**
The National Weather Service has released an updated winter outlook for December through February, predicting a 'weak' La Niña pattern. According to the Climate Prediction Center, La Niña is expected to develop and last through winter, which could lead to a wetter winter with more numerous storm systems moving across the Great Lakes region. However, temperatures are more difficult to predict, with an equal chance of being above or below average. Historically, La Niña winters have been mixed, with five colder-than-normal, six warmer-than-normal, and three near-normal winters in Chicago since 1996. The average snowfall is 38.4 inches, but Chicago only had around 20 inches in the past two years, making it likely that this winter will be wetter than average but not as mild as the past few winters. As noted by the National Weather Service, 'it's likely not going to be as mild as the past few winters have been in Chicago.'

National Weather Service meteorologist Ricky Castro said, 'It's a little too early to say' whether there will be precipitation, but there is 'pretty high confidence' that it will be a colder pattern. The week of Thanksgiving will bring a 'return to colder conditions' after milder weather in the low 50s on Sunday. A cold front is expected to come through the Chicago area on Monday, bringing a chilly air mass into the region. After the holiday weekend, Castro said that a 'pretty cold start to December' appears likely, with even colder air coming into the region. This could bring 'occasional chances for accumulating snow,' with Thursday's snowfall being the season's first 'wake-up call that we're in Northern Illinois.'

**Chicago forecast: Dense fog, waves of rain before chance for season's 1st snow**
The Chicago area is expecting a rainy and foggy day on Monday, with waves of showers and mild temperatures before the possibility of the season's first snowflakes later in the week. A dense fog advisory was issued for areas to the north, with visibility reduced to a quarter mile or less. The National Weather Service warned of slow travel and cautioned drivers to use caution. Meteorologist Alicia Roman predicted that sprinkles would start moving in around 8 a.m., followed by more widespread rain by 12 p.m. Temperatures are expected to be above-average, with highs reaching 58 degrees on Monday and the low 60s on Tuesday. However, colder air is expected to move in later in the week, bringing a chance of snow. Roman noted that just a little bit of snow could cause trouble for the Thursday morning commute. Typically, Chicago sees its first measurable snow on November 18, and its first average snow of one inch or more on December 7.

**Chicago's First Snowfall Delayed: Unusual Warmth Continues**
Chicago is experiencing an unusually warm fall, which has delayed the first snowfall of the season. Typically, the city sees its first snowfall before November, but this year's warm temperatures have pushed back the event. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the city has not yet experienced its first measurable snowfall this year, and the warm weather may continue to delay the event. The NWS predicts a 70-80% chance of above-average temperatures in Illinois, including Chicago, from November 14-22, which reduces the likelihood of snow in the next few weeks. The last time Chicago took this long to register its first snowfall was in 1999, when the first snowfall occurred on December 5. The city's last significant snowfall was on December 28, 2021, three days after Christmas. The warm temperatures for November are also unusual, with highs expected to reach 16°C (61°F) in some areas, which is uncommon for this time of year. While this warm trend may reduce the chances of snow, it does not rule it out. An increase in precipitation is projected for late November, which could bring a rapid drop in temperatures and the first snowfall. However, the type of precipitation will depend on how temperatures fluctuate in the coming weeks. The NWS indicates that Chicago has a higher probability of experiencing rain than snow in the short term.

**When will Chicago see its first snow? Extended forecasts shed light on wintry weather**
Chicago has not yet seen its first trace of snowfall this year, despite passing the typical date for the city's first snow on October 31. According to the National Weather Service, there is a 70-80% chance that the city will see above-average temperatures between November 14-22, and a 60-70% chance of above-average temperatures through the beginning of December. The Climate Prediction Center notes that temperatures are expected to remain in the upper-50s this week, with a chance for a 60-degree day, and that all models are leaning toward above-average precipitation for the Chicago area during this time. As a result, any dip in temperatures could be accompanied by precipitation, whether that be rain or snow. 'For context, the average high temperature in Chicago will dip below 50 degrees on Wednesday, and by the end of the month, the average high in the city will be around 41 degrees,' according to NWS historical data. The latest Chicago has gone without a trace to snow to begin the season was December 5, 1999, and the latest first measurable snowfall of the year occurred in December 2021, when the city didn’t see one-tenth of an inch of snow or more until three days after Christmas.

**Days getting shorter; winter solstice 7 weeks away**
November has begun in Chicago with 10 hours and 22 minutes of daylight, which will decrease to 9 hours and 23 minutes by the end of the month. The winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, is 7 weeks away on December 21, 2024. According to the ancient Druids and Celts, this time of year, known as 'Yule', marks the promise of longer days ahead. On average, November sees 2.5 inches of rain and almost 2 inches of snow. The month is also the fastest cooling period of the year, with the average high temperature dropping from the mid-50s to the low 40s by the 30th, and the average low temperature dropping from 40 to 29 degrees. 'Yule' celebrations often started on or around the winter solstice and could last for several days, marking the beginning of longer days ahead.

**Weather | It’s almost Halloween, but this week will feel like summer just ahead of trick-or-treating**
Chicago is experiencing an unusual warm spell ahead of Halloween, with temperatures forecast to reach the high 70s to low 80s on Tuesday and Wednesday. Gino Izzi, senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Chicago, said, 'We’re really looking at a pretty unprecedented warm spell.' The warmth will only last until Wednesday night, when a cold front and widespread showers will pass through. The warm weather has raised concerns about grass fires and wildfires, but the rain on Wednesday may provide some relief from a moderate drought affecting central and northern Illinois. However, a real fall treat will come Thursday night, with temperatures cooling down to 45 to 50 degrees in the evening, just in time for trick-or-treating. According to climate scientists, fall temperatures have warmed by 2.5 degrees on average across the United States since 1970, with Chicago's October nights getting hotter by 3 degrees in the same timespan.

**Chicago Weather Forecast for October 28, 2024**
On October 28, 2024, Chicago is expected to experience a warm day with a high temperature of 70 °F (21 °C) and a low of 52 °F (12 °C). The day will start with clear skies and rain at night. Winds will be moderate, reaching speeds of up to 11 mph (20 km/h), contributing to a pleasant feeling of warmth. As the day progresses, dry conditions and high temperatures will prevail, making it suitable for outdoor activities. The sunrise will be at 7:18 am and sunset at 5:49 pm, providing approximately 11 hours of sunlight. The relative humidity will be around 70%, a typical level in Chicago during October. Additionally, the UV index is expected to be moderate, reaching a maximum of 5, suggesting caution for those exposed to the sun for extended periods. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the temperature in Chicago is expected to be around 70 °F (21 °C) and 52 °F (12 °C), with a feeling temperature of around 63 °F (17 °C). In Illinois, a mostly sunny day with a possibility of light rain at night is forecasted in major cities. Chicago's climate is generally warm and humid in the summer, with frequent precipitation, and cold in the winter, with frequent snow and strong winds. Throughout the year, the sky tends to be partially cloudy, with temperatures ranging from -6 °C to 28 °C, rarely dropping below -15 °C or exceeding 33 °C. October brings a seasonal transition, causing significant changes in temperatures. Some days can be warm, while others experience sudden drops. This time of year is ideal for the Chicago Marathon, as the weather is usually pleasant and suitable for competition. However, in recent years, temperatures during the marathon have been unusually high, resulting in hospitalizations for several runners. Interestingly, three years ago, snow was recorded in October. Despite this, strong winds are a constant during this season, with temperatures typically ranging from 6 °C to 17 °C. The United States has a notable variety of climates due to its vast geographical extent. In the eastern region, two main types of climate predominate: the humid subtropical and the continental humid, which vary according to temperature and precipitation conditions throughout the year.

**A La Niña winter is expected, scientists say. Here’s what it means for snow and temps in Chicago.**
Scientists predict a La Niña winter for most of the country, including Chicago and Illinois, which may bring a colder and wetter winter. According to the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center, there's a 60% chance of La Niña emerging between September to November, with the expectation that it will continue through March. Illinois state climatologist Trent Ford cautioned that there's a lot of variability between La Niña years, and other weather patterns can affect the outcome. However, he noted that La Niña can cause a 'more northerly storm track' in the winter months, leading to colder and wetter conditions in the northern part of the continental U.S. Ford said there's a strong chance that Chicago will be wetter than normal from December through February, with a tendency for more cold outbreaks during La Niña winters. However, he also noted that there's a long-term warming trend in the region due to climate change, and that this La Niña is 'moderate' or 'medium strength.'

However, he noted that there's a big caveat to these predictions, as lots of other events can affect the weather, including sea ice in the Arctic and Eurasian snow cover. 'Unfortunately, after a brief period in the spring of 2024 with minimal drought conditions across the country, more than a quarter of the land mass in the continental U.S. is currently in at least a moderate drought,' said Brad Pugh, operational drought lead with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center. 'And the winter precipitation outlook does not bode well for widespread relief.'

**Chicago's Winter Forecast: Wetter and Snowier, but Will it be Colder?**
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the winter of 2024-25 in Chicago is expected to be 'wetter than normal' and 'snowier' due to the 'La Niña' weather pattern. This is a significant change from the previous winter of 2023-24, which was the fourth warmest on record. Kevin Jeanes of NBC 5 Storm Team said that the predictions are a welcome change, as the area has been experiencing a moderate drought. 'We need it,' Jeanes said. The NOAA predicts above-average snowfall for the Chicago area, with 18.5 inches of snow recorded in the 2023-24 winter season, 11.1 inches below the normal. However, it's unclear whether the temperatures will make the precipitation fall as rain or snow. Jeanes said that it's possible that the temperatures could be colder, but only compared to the extremely warm temperatures of the previous winter. 'If the temperatures are closer to average, it will feel colder than last year,' Jeanes said. The NOAA predicts 'the same possibilities' of temperatures being above or below average. 'I'm not sure if it's going to be a colder winter,' Jeanes said. 'There are the same possibilities of it being above or below average.' However, the entire northwest region is expected to have a much colder winter, Jeanes noted.

**How cold, snowy could Chicago's winter be? Latest winter weather predictions**
According to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) latest winter weather outlook for 2024-25, a 'La Niña' winter is expected, which would result in a 'wetter than normal' winter in the Great Lakes, especially in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. Kevin Jeanes, a meteorologist, said that this would be beneficial as the region has been experiencing a moderate drought. The winter precipitation outlook for the Chicago area is expected to be above average, with 18.5 inches of snow recorded during the 2023-24 meteorological winter, 11.1 inches below normal. However, the big question is whether temperatures will cause precipitation to fall in the form of rain or snow. Jeanes noted that it could be colder than last year, but only compared to the extremely warm temperatures recorded in 2023-24. NOAA predicts 'equal chances' of temperatures being above or below average. A much colder winter is expected across the Northwest, while a La Niña event typically leads to cooler springs if the pattern persists. According to the Climate Prediction Center, La Niña is favored to emerge between September and November and is expected to persist through the winter months.

**Chicago Prepares for First Snows of Winter**
Temperatures in Illinois, USA, are dropping, and frost warnings are being issued in Chicago. While immediate forecasts do not predict snow, the city is preparing for the first signs of winter. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the first light snows typically occur by the end of October, marking the beginning of winter. Estimated snowfall dates are as follows: light snows (less than 2.54 cm) are expected on average by October 31, significant snowfall (2.54 cm or more) is expected to occur from November 18, and snowfall of one inch or more is expected on December 7. However, it is possible that snow could occur earlier. This winter may be influenced by La Niña, a weather pattern that could lead to a 'wetter-than-normal' winter, especially in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the La Niña event is expected to strengthen during the winter months. This forecast also predicts that more storm systems will hit the Chicago area, with a 50/50 chance of precipitation being rain or snow. However, the University of Illinois notes that stronger La Niña patterns can produce winters that are 'warmer and wetter than average', with more snow and winter storms during those seasons.

**Chicago's Winter Forecast: La Niña's Impact and Preparation**
The arrival of 'La Niña' could affect the climate in Chicago with colder temperatures and more precipitation. Although the phenomenon will be weaker than usual, residents should be prepared. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) estimates a 60% chance of La Niña establishing itself in the region, which could last until March. This could lead to a colder and wetter winter, although the intensity of the phenomenon is expected to be weaker than usual. Zachary Yack, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, warns that, although the chances of cold snaps are high, there could also be periods of warmer temperatures. 'When La Niña is weak, the behavior of the climate can become atypical,' he said. The Old Farmer's Almanac predicts that, unlike the rest of the country, Chicago could face a colder winter due to the combined influence of La Niña and the Australian Oscillation of El Niño. 'Chicago does not necessarily follow the same rules as the rest of the United States,' said Sarah Perrault, editor-in-chief of the almanac. According to their predictions, the coldest periods would arrive at the beginning and end of November, the beginning of December, and between the end of January and the beginning of February. Although the forecasts point to the possibility of temperatures below average in Chicago, the predictions about precipitation are mixed. The weakening of La Niña could reduce the number of significant winter storms, but residents are advised to stay alert and prepared for the winter weather, as even a weak phenomenon can trigger intense storms at certain times.

**How will winter be in Illinois: the amount of snow that will fall in the prairie state**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its winter climate forecast for 2024-25. The winter season in Illinois is expected to be influenced by the 'La Niña' climate phenomenon, which is characterized by the cooling of Pacific Ocean waters. This may lead to some unexpected weather patterns in the state. The NOAA indicates that the 'La Niña' pattern is expected to strengthen during the winter season, which runs from December 1 to February 28, and may direct the prevailing jet stream more to the north, leading to more storm systems hitting the Chicago area. According to AccuWeather, Chicago is expected to receive between 76 and 114 cm of snow this winter, which is significantly more than the 56.4 cm received in 2023 and even exceeds the average of the past decade, which was 97.5 cm. AccuWeather's meteorologist, Paul Pastelok, notes that a less intense 'La Niña' allows other climate variables to take center stage, which could result in a more variable winter. In Chicago, this could mean warmer-than-usual temperatures and less heating demand in the northern half of the state. Although there is a possibility of a polar vortex in February, the certainty of its arrival is low. This could influence the appearance of intense cold air in the United States. The University of Illinois notes that stronger 'La Niña' patterns tend to produce winters that are 'warmer and wetter than average,' with more snow and winter storms during those seasons.

**Chicago winter weather outlook; how will La Niña affect snow and temperatures?**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its annual Winter Weather Outlook, covering meteorological winter from December 2024 to February 2025. For the Chicago area, the outlook predicts a wetter-than-normal winter with average temperatures. The developing La Niña weather pattern is expected to influence precipitation predictions, with above-average precipitation anticipated due to La Niña positioning the jet stream over the Great Lakes. This leads to a wetter-than-average pattern for parts of the Midwest and Great Lakes, while the southern United States is expected to be drier-than-average. According to Jon Gottschalck, chief of the Operational Prediction Branch of the Climate Prediction Center, 'This winter, an emerging La Niña is anticipated to influence the upcoming winter patterns, especially our precipitation predictions.' Officials with the Chicago National Weather Service added, 'La Niña conditions across the tropical Pacific Ocean may play a role in the weather pattern across North America this winter (leading to more storm systems in the central US). With that said, the ultimate seasonal snowfall and temperatures on a local basis will depend on storm tracks.'

**NOAA Releases Winter Weather Forecast for Chicago Area**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its winter weather forecast for the Chicago area, and residents may need to prepare for what's to come. According to NOAA officials, a 'slow-developing' La Niña event in the Pacific Ocean will likely strengthen the dominant weather pattern in the Great Lakes, resulting in a 'wetter-than-normal' winter, especially in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. The La Niña pattern is expected to intensify during the meteorological winter, which runs from December 1 to February 28, and will likely direct the prevailing jet stream more to the north, causing more storm systems to hit the Chicago area. The question remains whether temperatures will cause precipitation to fall as rain or snow. At this point, NOAA says there is 'equal probability' of temperatures above or below average, which could have a significant impact on whether it rains or snows in the region. According to NOAA, they have implemented several improvements to their forecasting tools, including an experimental model called the 'Winter Storm Severity Probability Index'. These data were used to help with this year's projections after it was first implemented at the end of 2023, according to officials. According to the University of Illinois, the strongest La Niña patterns can produce winters that are 'warmer and wetter than average', with more snow and winter storms during those seasons. A La Niña event also tends to cause colder springs if the pattern persists. In a La Niña event, the trade winds are stronger than usual and push warm water away from the Americas and towards Asia, allowing a process known as 'upwelling' to occur, which brings cold water to the ocean's surface. These cold waters cause polar jet streams to form more to the north, leading to droughts in the southern United States and more precipitation in the Midwest and the northwest Pacific.

**Chicago’s Winter Will Be Colder And Snowier Than Last Year, AccuWeather Predicts**
AccuWeather predicts a colder and snowier winter for Chicago, with 30-45 inches of snow forecast, a significant increase from last year's 22 inches. According to senior meteorologist Paul Pastelok, a La Niña weather pattern developing in the Pacific Ocean is the main reason for this forecast. Pastelok expects a weak and short-term La Niña, lasting from December to early January, which can cause jet streams to shift northward and bring winter storms to Chicago. He recommends Chicagoans check their power generator batteries in case of unexpected outages, especially as ice builds up mid-season. 'Be prepared here in the late fall and watch for some early systems, especially north and west of Chicago,' Pastelok said. 'I'm concerned about January, where there could be a lot more mixed [precipitation] events and then falling back to more of a snow pattern going into February.'
