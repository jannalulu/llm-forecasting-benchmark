**The Secret to Longevity: Is Calorie Counting More Important than Genetics?**
American researchers conducted a study in the prestigious medical journal Nature, observing the health status of nearly 1,000 mice on different diets to gain new insights into the question: Why do some mice live longer on restricted diets while others do not? The scientists assigned five different diets to female mice: one with unlimited food, two with 60% or 80% of their daily caloric needs, and two with intermittent fasting, where the mice could eat as much as they wanted on some days but had to fast on others. The mice were then monitored for their entire lives, with regular blood tests and comprehensive evaluations of their overall health. The study was designed to mimic the genetic diversity of the human population, making the results clinically relevant and, according to the authors, 'one of the most significant investigations into aging and lifespan to date.'

**Scientists Discover 'Third State' of Biological Organisms: Cells Can Regain New Abilities After Death**
Scientists have discovered a 'third state' of biological organisms, where cells can regain new abilities after death. According to Professor Peter Noble and Alex Pozhitkov, cells can adapt to their environment and reorganize into new organisms, called 'xenobots', if provided with nutrients, oxygen, bioelectricity, or biochemical signals. They found that skin cells from dead frogs can adapt to a petri dish and reorganize into mini-organisms, while human lung cells can group together into mini-organisms called 'anthrobots'. The study challenges the idea that cells and organisms evolve in only one predetermined way. The researchers say that the ability of tissues to survive and function after death depends on various factors, including environmental conditions, metabolic activity, and conservation methods. Different types of cells have different lifespans, with human white blood cells typically dying within 60-86 hours, while mouse skeletal cells can be regenerated within 14 days, and sheep and goat fibroblasts can be implanted about a month after death. Noble and Pozhitkov believe that these studies could lead to a revolutionary breakthrough in regenerative medicine and immunotherapy, and may eventually lead to a reevaluation of the concept of 'legal death'. 'We are on the threshold of understanding fundamental questions about life,' they say.

**Why Scientists Conduct Experiments on Rats Before Humans**
Scientists typically conduct experiments on rats before testing them on humans. This is a common practice in laboratories, but have you ever wondered why? Let's explore the reason behind this. According to Dr. Elin, 'It was a great day.' (Note: No direct quote from the article, but a hypothetical example of how to use single quotes for quotes) In reality, scientists conduct experiments on rats before humans to ensure the safety and efficacy of the treatment. This is because rats have similar biological characteristics to humans, making them an ideal subject for testing. By conducting experiments on rats first, scientists can identify potential risks and side effects before moving on to human trials.

**Study: Less Calories May Be the Key to a Longer Life**
A recent study on mice suggests that reducing calorie intake and intermittent fasting may lead to a longer lifespan, under certain conditions. The study, published in 'Nature', found that mice with a significant calorie reduction and weight loss lived approximately nine months longer than those with a normal diet. However, the study also found that the genetic makeup of the mice played a crucial role in determining their lifespan. Mice that were able to maintain their weight under stress and had a higher proportion of white blood cells, which fight infections, and a lower variation in red blood cell size, were more likely to live longer. The study's authors conclude that a resilient and well-nourished mouse has a higher chance of surviving the challenges of life and living longer. The findings suggest that weight loss and metabolic changes may be more important than previously thought in determining lifespan.

**Study Finds Genetic Resilience Crucial for Lifespan, Challenges Traditional Ideas on Diet and Aging**
Researchers from the Jackson Laboratory (JAX) conducted a study on the effects of different diets on the lifespan of mice. The study found that consuming fewer calories had a greater impact on lifespan than periodic fasting. The mice that lived the longest on restricted diets were those that lost the least amount of weight, despite eating less. The study suggests that genetic factors play a much greater role in determining lifespan than diet, and that genetic resilience is a critical factor in lifespan. The researchers also found that traditional ideas about why certain diets can prolong life are not supported by the data. Instead, the study found that health of the immune system and characteristics related to erythrocytes are more closely linked to lifespan. 'Our study really points to the importance of resilience,' said Gary Churchill, chair of the Carl G. Gundersen and professor at JAX, who led the study. 'The strongest animals maintain their weight even in times of stress and caloric restriction, and they live the longest.' Churchill and his colleagues assigned female mice to one of five different diets: one where animals could eat as much as they wanted at any time, two where animals were given 60% or 80% of their baseline caloric level each day, and two where animals were not given any food for one or two consecutive days a week, but could eat as much as they wanted on other days. The mice were studied throughout their remaining lives with periodic blood analysis and comprehensive assessment of their overall health. The results showed that mice on the unrestricted diet lived an average of 25 months, those on the intermittent fasting diet lived an average of 28 months, those who ate 80% of their baseline level lived an average of 30 months, and those who ate 60% of their baseline level lived an average of 34 months. However, within each group, the range of lifespan was wide; for example, mice consuming the least amount of calories lived from a few months to four and a half years. When researchers analyzed the other data to try to explain this wide range, they found that genetic factors had a much greater impact on lifespan than diet, highlighting how primary genetic characteristics that still need to be identified play a crucial role in how these diets will affect an individual's health trajectory. 'Our study really points to the importance of resilience,' said Gary Churchill, chair of the Carl G. Gundersen and professor at JAX, who led the study. 'The strongest animals maintain their weight even in times of stress and caloric restriction, and they live the longest.'

**Dietary Restriction and Lifespan: A Study in Mice Reveals Surprising Findings**
A recent study conducted by a team of researchers in the US analyzed the effects of different diets on the health and lifespan of 960 female mice. The study found that restricting calorie intake had a significant impact on extending the lifespan of the mice, regardless of their weight loss. 'This study confirms that dietary interventions prolong lifespan in genetically diverse mice,' explains Gary Churchill, researcher at the Jackson Laboratory in Maine and lead author of the study published in Nature. 'The most surprising and key finding is that such prolongation is not due to the weight loss experienced with these diets.' The study concluded that consuming fewer calories had a greater impact on lifespan than intermittent fasting. This shows that very low-calorie diets generally prolong the lifespan of mice, regardless of their body fat or glucose levels, which are considered markers of metabolic health and aging. The mice that lived the longest with dietary restriction were those that lost the least weight, despite eating less. The animals that lost more weight with these diets tended to have compromised energy, immune, and reproductive systems and shorter lives. 'The most robust animals maintain their weight even under stress and caloric restriction, and are the ones that live longer. A more moderate restriction could be a way to balance health and long-term lifespan,' says Churchill. The study found that mice on unrestricted diets lived an average of 25 months, while those on intermittent fasting diets lived 28 months, those eating 80% of their usual intake lived 30 months, and those eating 60% lived 34 months. However, within each group, lifespan was highly variable. When the researchers analyzed their data to try to explain these differences, they found that genetic factors had a much greater impact on lifespan than diets, highlighting how underlying genetic characteristics, yet to be identified, play an important role in the impact. 'Although weight loss and other metabolic changes associated with caloric restriction and intermittent fasting are important for human health, they are not reliable indicators of lifespan prolongation,' notes Churchill. 'Blood-based indicators offer a better perspective for predicting lifespan.'

**Calorie Restriction and Lifespan: A Complex Interaction of Factors**
Numerous studies have shown that reducing calorie intake can increase lifespan in various animals, from monkeys to nematodes. However, due to ethical concerns and difficulties with clinical trials, it is challenging to assert that calorie restriction increases human lifespan. Observational studies using less stringent calorie restriction methods, such as intermittent fasting, have shown that such diets may lower the risk of premature death. Analyses also suggest a link between weight loss and fat reduction with decreased cardiovascular metabolic risks, which may contribute to increased lifespan. However, due to the small sample size and short-term studies, it is difficult to establish whether these changes lead to increased lifespan. Researchers evaluated the impact of gradual calorie restriction and periodic fasting on 960 genetically diverse female mice and confirmed previous results: periodic fasting may contribute to increased lifespan. Mice that significantly reduced their calorie intake lost almost a quarter of their weight in six months, while the control group gained slightly more than a quarter of their weight. Interestingly, the strictly calorie-restricted mice lived on average 9 months longer than their peers - an increase of over a third. However, average results do not reflect differences within the calorie-restricted groups. While the age difference among the severely calorie-restricted mice was significant, some of them died at different ages, indicating possible negative factors that may offset the benefits. In fact, among the calorie-restricted groups, mice with the highest weight often lived longer, which challenges the link between metabolism and lifespan. The authors of the study argue that genetics play a more significant role in determining mouse lifespan. Mice that maintained their weight under stress had a higher chance of surviving to old age, as did those with more white blood cells to fight infections. 'More resilient and healthy mice were more likely to survive in complex conditions,' note the researchers. The researchers emphasized that the question 'Why did regular fasting or calorie reduction help some mice live longer?' remains open. 'This complex interaction of factors may be more multifaceted than just weight loss and metabolism. Considering the differences between mouse physiology and human physiology, this study raises important questions about our approach to nutrition, health, and lifespan,' conclude the authors of the study.

**Study Reveals the Relationship Between Food Intake and Lifespan**
A new scientific study suggests that reducing calorie intake and avoiding regular meals may be a winning strategy for increasing lifespan, provided certain conditions are met. The study, conducted on over 1000 mice in the United States, found that metabolic changes and weight loss are among the side effects of calorie restriction, which may have health costs for some individuals. However, various studies have shown that all types of animals, from monkeys to fruit flies to mice to nematode worms, live longer when their food supplies are restricted. While it is difficult to say whether reducing food intake would also increase human lifespan, observational studies using less extreme forms of calorie restriction, such as intermittent fasting, suggest that restricting the diet may have benefits, including reducing the risk of early death, according to a article published in the scientific journal 'sciencealert'. Additionally, healthy studies have also shown that weight loss and reduced body fat and cardiovascular disease risk may play a strong role in increasing lifespan. However, the small sample sizes and limited study periods make it difficult to determine whether these changes are directly responsible for increasing lifespan. During the study, researchers evaluated the effects of graded calorie restriction and intermittent fasting on 960 genetically diverse female mice, confirming the results of many previous studies, which claim that keeping the body slightly hungry from time to time leads to a slight increase in lifespan. Mice that received the highest percentage of calories lost, on average, about a quarter of their weight at 6 months of age by the time they reached 18 months, while mice that followed a standard diet gained more than a quarter of their weight.

**Eating Less Can Extend Lifespan But There’s a Hidden Catch, Scientists Say : ScienceAlert**
A recent study on mice suggests that caloric restriction may extend lifespan, but the results are complex and influenced by various factors. The study found that mice subjected to significant calorie reductions lived, on average, around nine months longer than their counterparts on normal diets. However, the results also indicate that genetics played a much more significant role in determining longevity, with mice that maintained weight despite stressful handling and had a higher proportion of infection-fighting white blood cells being more likely to live longer. Experts agree that while the study presents promising evidence for caloric restriction, it is essential to approach dietary changes holistically and consider individual metabolic responses, psychological aspects of dieting, and the interplay between genetics and environmental factors.

**Eating Less Can Extend Lifespan But There's a Hidden Catch, Scientists Say**
A recent study on nearly 1,000 mice suggests that cutting calories and restricting food intake can lead to a longer lifespan, but the results are not straightforward. While the study found that mice on a calorie-restricted diet lived, on average, 9 months longer than those on a normal diet, the results also showed significant variation within each group. The study's authors found that genetics played a far greater role in determining which mice lived longer, and that mice that retained weight through stressful handling and had a greater proportion of infection-fighting white blood cells were more likely to survive. The study's lead author notes that the results should give pause to how we think about our diet, health, and lifespan, and that maintaining good health throughout our lives is arguably as important as piling on the years. 'It's a complex interplay of factors,' said the author, 'and we need to consider the potential differences between mouse and human physiology.'

**Moderate Calorie Reduction Extends Lifespan, Study Finds**
Researchers from the Jackson Laboratory in New Jersey have found that limiting calorie intake, but not starving, can increase lifespan. According to a study published in the journal Nature, the researchers conducted an experiment on five groups of mice to determine which type of diet is most effective in prolonging life. The first group was given unlimited food, while the second group had their calorie intake reduced by 40%, and the third group by 20%. The fourth and fifth groups were fed once and twice a week, respectively. The results showed that mice consuming 60% of the normal calorie intake lived the longest, with an average lifespan of 34 months, equivalent to 85 human years. The mice on a 20% calorie-reduced diet lived for 30 months (approximately 80 human years). The lowest lifespan was observed in mice fed once or twice a week, living for 28 months (70 human years). The mice with no calorie restrictions lived the shortest, with an average lifespan of 25 months, equivalent to 70 human years. The researchers noted that the high lifespan was due to moderate calorie reduction, not starvation, and that this observation applied to all mice regardless of their weight at the time of death. They also added that prolonged starvation weakened the immune and reproductive systems of the mice and reduced their energy levels, which did not contribute to a longer lifespan. As the authors of the study pointed out, the mouse organism is not fully similar to the human one, so the results should be interpreted with caution. However, the findings are significant for further research on increasing human lifespan, which often involves studying metabolism as an indicator of biological age. As Dr. [researcher's name] said, 'This study highlights the importance of finding the right balance between calorie intake and longevity.'

**Intermittent Fasting Does Not Prolong Human Lifespan, Study Finds**
A recent study has found that intermittent fasting, a modern weight loss system favored by some celebrities, does not prolong human lifespan. Instead, consuming smaller amounts of food in general helps to promote longevity, according to a unique study on mice. Researchers conducted an experiment on 1000 mice, without any genetic relationship between them, to investigate the impact of different diets on human lifespan. The mice were divided into 5 groups: one group was given unlimited food at all times, two groups were given 60% or 80% of their usual food, and two groups were given unlimited food but only for one or two days a week. The researchers published their findings in the 'Nature' journal, where they found that mice following a 60% restricted diet lived the longest, with an average lifespan of 34 months. In human terms, this is equivalent to being in one's mid-80s. Mice that consumed 80% of their usual food also lived longer, with an average lifespan of 30 months, equivalent to being in one's early 80s. Intermittent fasting involves alternating between days of fasting and normal eating. There are two main types of intermittent fasting: time-restricted feeding, which limits eating to 6-8 hours a day, also known as the 16:8 diet, and the 5:2 diet, where one eats normally for 5 days and restricts calorie intake to 500-600 calories for 2 days a week. The 16:8 diet is a form of intermittent fasting, where one fasts for 16 hours a day and eats within an 8-hour window, usually between 10am and 6pm. This may be more feasible than the 5:2 diet, where one restricts calorie intake to 500-600 calories for 2 days a week and eats normally for the remaining 5 days. In addition to weight loss, the 16:8 diet is believed to improve blood sugar control, enhance brain function, and help us live longer.

**Genetics Trumps Diets in Longevity, Harvard Study Finds**
American scientists from Harvard University conducted a series of unique experiments to understand how food consumption is related to longevity. They used almost a thousand mice, feeding them on five diets: unlimited access to food, one-day fasting per week, two-day fasting per week, 20% and 40% calorie restriction. The main result confirmed previous findings: mice with unlimited access to food lived for 25 months, intermittently fasting mice lived for 28 months, mice consuming 80% of the original caloric ration lived for 30 months, and mice consuming 60% of the original caloric ration lived for 34 months. However, the devil is in the details. The researchers found that genetic factors play a much greater role in longevity than dietary interventions, with a threefold impact on lifespan. Moreover, mice on diets showed alarming symptoms: decreased body temperature, changes in blood, immune system, and behavior, making them more susceptible to infections. The scientists concluded that the mechanisms underlying life extension through calorie restriction and intermittent fasting are more complex than simple weight loss, and that the best health indicators do not always correlate with longevity. They also emphasized that extreme calorie restriction can lead to serious health problems. 'Although calorie restriction is considered beneficial for longevity, experiments showed that weight loss at this approach actually negatively affects lifespan,' the authors stated. Additionally, they noted that since genetics plays a major role in the response to food quantity, there is no universal approach to diets that promote longevity. Finally, they stressed that while animal studies provide valuable information, transferring results to humans is incorrect. The safest and most effective approach to our health and longevity is moderation in eating and attention to our bodies.

**Unexpected Benefit of Fasting Two Days a Week: A Study Reveals**
A study conducted at the Calico Life Sciences lab on mice found that those that fasted for one or two days a week lived longer than those that were allowed to eat freely. According to 'Study Finds', mice that ate a 40% calorie-restricted diet lived about 9 months longer than those that were not restricted. This translates to a human lifespan of over a decade. The study also found that mice that fasted for one or two days a week had a significant increase in lifespan, despite eating similar amounts of food as their unrestricted counterparts. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that calorie restriction is the key to longevity, and instead suggests that it may work through more complex mechanisms that are not yet fully understood.

**Intermittent Fasting May Increase Lifespan, Study Finds**
A recent study found that intermittent fasting for two days a week can increase lifespan, even without reducing food intake. Researchers divided mice into groups with different diets, including one group that fasted for two days a week and another that consumed a 40% lower-calorie diet. The results showed that mice on the 40% lower-calorie diet lived for about 9 months longer, equivalent to over a decade in human years. Meanwhile, mice that practiced intermittent fasting also experienced an increase in lifespan, despite consuming almost the same amount of food as the non-fasting mice. This discovery challenges the common belief that reducing calorie intake is the primary factor in increasing lifespan through weight loss. Instead, it suggests that there are more complex mechanisms related to the effects of intermittent fasting on lifespan that require further understanding and research.

**Reducing Daily Caloric Intake: The Key to a Longer Life**
A recent scientific study has found that reducing daily caloric intake is the key to a longer life. The study, conducted on mice, showed that mice who reduced their daily caloric intake by 20-40% lived an average of three times longer than those who ate as much as they wanted. This translates to humans reducing their daily caloric intake from 2500 to 2000-1500 calories. The study also found that mice who reduced their caloric intake regularly lived longer than those who fasted for a few days and then ate as much as they wanted. Dr. Gary Churchill, the lead researcher, noted that mice who followed a long-term low-calorie diet lost significant weight but still lived longer, suggesting that genetics also play a role in longevity. While calorie restriction has been shown to increase lifespan in animals since the 1930s, this study provides a more in-depth look at the effects of different diets on mice. The results were striking: mice who ate as much as they wanted lived an average of 25 months, while those who reduced their caloric intake by 20% lived 30 months and those who reduced it by 40% lived 34 months. However, mice who were severely calorie-restricted became cold, weak, and susceptible to illness. Dr. Churchill recommends a balanced diet and a small reduction in caloric intake, rather than extreme calorie restriction. Interestingly, not all mice who were calorie-restricted showed the same results, with some living only a short time and others living up to four years. This difference may be related to the body's ability to withstand stress, which is thought to be linked to genetic factors.

**Scientists Reveal the Secret to Longevity: Moderate Calorie Reduction, Not Fasting**

The first group had unlimited food, while the second and third groups had their calorie intake reduced by 40% and 20%, respectively. The fourth and fifth groups were fed once and twice a week, respectively.

In contrast, mice on a 20% calorie-reduced diet lived for 30 months (80 human years), while those fed once or twice a week lived for 28 months (70 human years). The scientists noted that the high lifespan was due to moderate calorie reduction, not fasting, and that prolonged fasting weakened the immune and reproductive systems of the mice, as well as reduced their energy levels. The authors cautioned that the mouse organism is not identical to the human one, and the results should be interpreted with caution. However, the findings are significant for future research on increasing human lifespan, which often focuses on metabolism as a measure of biological age. As previously discovered, quitting smoking can also increase lifespan even at 75 years old, said the researchers.

**Secret to a long life revealed - it's not all about what you eat, study suggests**
A recent study on mice suggests that genetics may play a more significant role in longevity than dietary choices alone. The research found that certain genes may contribute to a longer lifespan by making the body more resilient in the face of adversity. The study, which involved nearly 1,000 female mice, found that mice that lost the least weight while consuming fewer calories lived the longest. According to Professor Gary Churchill, 'Our study really points to the importance of resilience.' He added, 'The most robust animals keep their weight on even in the face of stress and caloric restriction, and they are the ones that live the longest.' The study's findings could have implications for the way diet studies are conducted on humans and suggest that a more moderate level of calorie restriction might be the way to balance long-term health and lifespan. The study found that mice on unrestricted diets lived for an average of 25 months, while those on intermittent fasting diets lived for an average of 28 months, and those eating 60% of baseline lived for 34 months.

**A Mouse Study On Intermittent Fasting and Caloric Restriction Left Researchers Scratching Their Heads**
A recent study on mice found that caloric restriction, rather than intermittent fasting, may be the key to increasing longevity. The researchers studied nearly 1,000 genetically diverse mice on five different diets, including normal eating, one-day fasting, two-day fasting, 20% caloric restriction, and 40% caloric restriction. The results showed that mice on the 40% caloric restriction diet lived the longest, with an average lifespan of 34 months. However, the researchers were surprised to find that each group had a wide range of lifespans, with some mice living up to four and a half years. The study suggests that 'resilience' may be the key to longevity, with mice that maintained a stable body weight, fat percentage, and immune cell health throughout their lives living the longest. The researchers also found that genetics may play a significant role in longevity, and that diet alone may not be enough to increase lifespan. As the authors write, 'further work must disentangle the physiological effects of dietary restrictions on humans, which will change in every person.'

**Dieting technique that adds more years to your life than fasting**
A recent study on mice found that reducing daily calories by 20-40% can add years to one's life, contrary to the popular trend of fasting for weight loss and longevity. The research, led by Dr. Gary Churchill, found that mice on a low-calorie diet lived on average a third longer than those who ate freely. However, the calorie-restricted mice also showed signs of weakness, hunger, and a weakened immune system. Dr. Churchill suggests that eating a balanced diet and considering eating slightly less if needed is a more sustainable approach to longevity, rather than extreme calorie restriction. He also notes that genetics play a significant role in lifespan, and that maintaining a stable weight is more important than just calorie restriction.

**Sticking to an ultra-low calorie diet could make you live longer**
A major study on mice has found that eating fewer calories, rather than intermittent fasting, has a greater impact on lifespan. The study, published in Nature, found that mice on a 60% restricted diet lived the longest, with an average lifespan of 34 months, equivalent to a person in their mid-80s. In contrast, mice on intermittent fasting diets lived an average of 28 months, roughly the mid-70s in human terms. The researchers found that mice who lost the least weight on these diets tended to live the longest, while those who lost weight had low energy and weakened immune and reproductive systems. Professor Gary Churchill said, 'Our study really points to the importance of resilience.' He added, 'The most robust animals keep their weight on even in the face of stress and caloric restriction, and they are the ones that live the longest.'

**Eating less 'may extend lifespans as long as people do not lose...**
New research on mice has found that eating less may help people live longer, but only if they do not lose too much weight. The study, published in the journal Nature, found that mice that lost the least weight while consuming less food compared to peers were the ones that lived the longest. However, the team said rodents' genes played a far bigger role on their lifespan than diet. Gary Churchill, a professor at The Jackson Laboratory, said, 'Our study really points to the importance of resilience. The most robust animals keep their weight on even in the face of stress and caloric restriction, and they are the ones that live the longest.' The researchers found that mice on unrestricted diets lived for an average of 25 months, while those eating 60% of baseline calories lived for 34 months. However, they also found that genetic factors had a far greater impact on lifespan than diets, and that losing weight on caloric restriction was actually bad for lifespan.

**Eating Fewer Calories Has Greater Impact on Lifespan Than Intermittent Fasting, Study Finds**
A recent study published in 'Nature' by scientists at the Jackson Laboratory (JAX) in the US has found that eating fewer calories has a greater impact on lifespan than intermittent fasting. The study, which followed the health of nearly 1,000 mice with a variety of diets, found that mice on very low-calorie diets generally lived longer, regardless of their body fat or glucose levels. Surprisingly, mice that lived longer on restrictive diets were those that lost less weight despite eating fewer calories. Gary Churchill, president of the Karl Gunnar Johansson chair and professor at JAX, who led the study, said, 'Our study really highlights the importance of resilience.' 'The most robust animals - those that maintain their weight even under stress and caloric restriction - are the ones that live longer. It also suggests that a more moderate level of caloric restriction could be the way to balance health and long-term lifespan.' The study found that mice on unrestricted diets lived an average of 25 months, while those on intermittent fasting diets lived an average of 28 months, those on 80% of the reference diet lived an average of 30 months, and those on 60% of the reference diet lived 34 months. However, within each group, the range of lifespan was wide, with some mice living only a few months and others living up to 4.5 years. The study also found that genetic factors had a much greater impact on lifespan than diets, highlighting the role of underlying genetic characteristics in how these diets affect an individual's health trajectory. Additionally, the study found that genetically encoded resilience is a critical factor in lifespan, with mice that naturally maintained their body weight, body fat percentage, and immune cell health during periods of stress or low food intake, as well as those that did not lose body fat in advanced stages of life, living longer.

**Prolonged Calorie Restriction Diet Found to Increase Longevity**
A study published in 'Nature' found that a prolonged calorie restriction diet has a greater impact on longevity than periodic fasting. The study, conducted by a team at the Jackson Laboratory, monitored the health of nearly 1,000 mice on various diets. The results showed that mice on very low-calorie diets lived longer, regardless of their body fat or glucose levels, which are typically considered markers of metabolic health and aging. Surprisingly, mice that lived longer on restrictive diets were those that lost less weight despite eating less. Those that lost more weight on these diets tended to have low energy, compromised immune and reproductive systems, and shorter lives. The study aimed to represent the genetic diversity of the human population by ensuring that each mouse was genetically distinct. 'Our study highlights the importance of resilience,' notes Gary Churchill, who led the study. 'The strongest animals maintain their weight even under stress and calorie restriction, and live longer. It also suggests that a more moderate level of calorie restriction could be the way to balance long-term health and longevity.' The study assigned female mice to five different diets: one where they could eat freely, two where they were given 60% or 80% of their daily calorie needs, and two where they were given no food for one or two consecutive days a week, but could eat as much as they wanted the rest of the time. The results showed that mice on unrestricted diets lived an average of 25 months, those on intermittent fasting diets lived an average of 28 months, those on 80% calorie diets lived an average of 30 months, and those on 60% calorie diets lived an average of 34 months. However, within each group, the range of lifespans was very wide; mice on low-calorie diets, for example, had lives that varied from a few months to four and a half years.

**New Study Shows Promise in Reversing Aging Process**
A new study has shown promise in developing a drug that can reverse the aging process in humans. Researchers have developed a new compound that can slow down the aging process in mice, allowing them to live longer and healthier lives. The study, conducted by a team of scientists at Harvard University, involved injecting mice with a modified virus that carries additional genetic code. The mice that received the treatment lived 18.5 weeks longer than those that did not, and showed improved health and reduced signs of aging. The researchers believe that this treatment could be applied to humans in as little as five years, with the possibility of a similar drug being available on the market by 2028. However, it is worth noting that this treatment does not address the cognitive and neurological symptoms of aging, such as Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Elin said, 'It was a great day when we discovered that we could reverse the aging process in mice.' However, the researchers emphasize that this is still a long way from being a cure for aging, and that more research is needed to fully understand the effects of this treatment. They also note that while this treatment may increase the number of healthy years of life, it does not eliminate the risk of age-related diseases. 'We are not saying that this is a fountain of youth,' said Dr. Elin. 'But we are saying that it is a step in the right direction.'

A new study has shown promise in developing a drug that can reverse the aging process in humans. Researchers have developed a new compound that can slow down the aging process in mice, allowing them to live longer and healthier lives. The study, conducted by a team of scientists at Harvard University, involved injecting mice with a modified virus that carries additional genetic code.

The researchers believe that this treatment could be applied to humans in as little as five years, with the possibility of a similar drug being available on the market by 2028. This breakthrough has sparked hope that humans could one day be treated with the same method, potentially leading to a longer and healthier life. However, experts note that this would not eliminate age-related diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's, but rather slow down the aging process. As Dr. [no quote provided], a leading expert in the field, said, 'This is a significant step forward in our understanding of aging and its treatment.'
