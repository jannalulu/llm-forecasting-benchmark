**Opinion: China Tariffs Are Coming. Beijing's Response Could Be a New Currency War.**
As Asia prepares for the potential impact of a new Trump administration, Pan Gongsheng, the governor of the People's Bank of China, will face significant challenges in navigating the economic shocks that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened. Trump's plans, including 60% tariffs on Chinese goods and a weaker dollar, could lead to a currency devaluation by China on a scale the global financial system has never encountered. This could have far-reaching consequences, including a potential new currency war. China's economy is already facing significant challenges, including a deepening property crisis, record youth unemployment, and dangerously high local-government debt. The timing of these challenges could not be worse, as Trump's administration is expected to be more aggressive in its trade policies. Pan's team will need to carefully manage the yuan to avoid a currency war and maintain economic stability.

**How can China unleash the spending power of its millions of migrant workers?**
Economists and academics urged China to step up 'people-centred urbanisation' and economic deregulation to boost domestic demand. Chi Fulin, president of the China Institute for Reform and Development, said, 'People-centred urbanisation is the fundamental solution to China's current domestic demand shortage.' He suggested filling public service gaps to empower China's nearly 300 million migrant workers, who could then power significant consumption. Chi emphasized the importance of incremental policies focused on people, rather than infrastructure, to boost consumption confidence and create long-term momentum for expanding domestic demand.

**Prospects remain challenging for new graduates**
A recent graduate, Guo, from the University of California, Los Angeles, and Johns Hopkins University, found it challenging to find a job in her field of consulting, despite her strong academic background. After sending her resume to over 50 companies, she received fewer than 10 responses. Guo noted that 'the job market feels vastly different from academia' and that hands-on experience is increasingly essential. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, China's unemployment rate for the urban labor force age 16 to 24 was 17.6 percent in September. Experts, including Sheng Laiyun, deputy head of the NBS, and Wang Ting, a professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, highlighted structural issues in the labor market, including changes in labor demand and technological unemployment. The government has introduced guidelines to expand employment channels for youth, including promoting vocational education and encouraging entrepreneurship. Guo hopes for more support for overseas students, including online interview opportunities and precise information-sharing platforms to understand domestic employment trends.

**China's Labor Market: Challenges and Opportunities**
The new e-book by China Files explores the world of work in China, from the state of the economy to pension reform, amidst a high youth unemployment rate and new generations seeking to make their way in a constantly changing job market. The e-book examines the main themes of the world of work in China, starting from the state of the Chinese economy, which is slowing down. 'For the first time in a long time, children think they might have it worse than their parents,' we write in the opening article of the e-book. The youth unemployment rate remains high, and more and more Chinese girls and boys are turning to 'blue-collar' jobs, giving up or abandoning a stressful career in large companies to seek a more peaceful life with more free time. However, things are not always going well outside of offices, as is the case for many delivery workers and gig-economy workers. Meanwhile, Beijing has tried to give the economy a boost by gradually raising the retirement age, a policy that has created many complaints among the population. It remains to be seen if it will be enough. The e-book includes articles by Lorenzo Lamperti, Sabrina Moles, Francesco Mattogno, Vittoria Mazzieri, and Alessandra Colarizzi.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Decreases, But Economy Still Faces Challenges**
China's youth unemployment rate has decreased to 17.6% in September, down from 18.8% in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (BNS). However, this rate is still very high and the second highest of the year. The decrease is partly due to a change in methodology, as students and high school students are no longer included in the calculation. The unemployment rate for the 16-24 age group is significantly higher than in June (13.2%), which is likely due to the fact that nearly 12 million students graduated from university in China in June, increasing the number of people on the job market. The BNS also reported a decrease in unemployment rates for other age groups, including 25-29 year olds (6.7% in September, down from 6.9% in August) and the overall national unemployment rate (5.1% in September, down from 5.3% in August). These numbers, which only account for urban areas, offer a glimmer of hope for China's economy, which has been struggling. The country is also facing low prices and a risk of deflation, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increasing by 0.4% in September over the past year, down from 0.6% in August. The BNS also reported a 2.8% decrease in factory gate prices in September over the past year, a decline that has been ongoing since the end of 2022. However, retail sales, which are the main indicator of household consumption, rebounded by 3.2% in September over the past year, after a 2.1% increase in August. The Chinese authorities have recently announced a series of measures to stimulate economic activity, including interest rate cuts and relaxations on property purchases. The People's Bank of China has also announced a 'swap' program for insurance companies and investment funds, with an initial amount of over 200 billion yuan (26 billion euros). The governor of the central bank, Pan Gongsheng, has also hinted at a possible reduction in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks before the end of 2024. The authorities hope that these efforts will support the economy and help achieve the official target of around 5% growth for 2024. However, opinions are divided, with some analysts believing that the recent measures are a step in the right direction, while others think that more needs to be done to address the structural challenges facing the economy.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Decreases to 17.6% in September**
China has announced that the unemployment rate for 16-24 year olds has slightly decreased to 17.6% in September, a figure closely watched as the country tries to revive its slowing economy. This rate, which does not include high school students and university students, is still high but lower than the 18.8% recorded in August, the highest level since the beginning of 2024, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China. The increase in the number of university graduates in June, with nearly 12 million students obtaining their diplomas, has added to the competition on the already difficult job market, which explains the sharp rise in unemployment this summer and its slight decline last month as some hiring took place. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, had declared in May that fighting youth unemployment should be considered an 'absolute priority'. The unemployment rate for 25-29 year olds has also decreased from 6.9% in August to 6.7% in September, and the overall unemployment rate for the country has decreased from 5.3% to 5.1%.

**China's youth unemployment rate falls after climbing for 2 months**
China's youth unemployment rate fell to 17.6% in September, down from 18.8% in August, according to official data. This decline comes after two consecutive months of rising youth unemployment. The rate for 25-to-29-year olds was 6.7%, and 3.9% for people between 30 and 59 years of age. Officials expressed confidence that the trend of stabilization and recovery would continue, but a separate survey showed that firms continued to hold off on hiring last month. As one official noted, 'the stabilisation and recovery trend that occurred in September' is expected to continue. However, the survey also showed that producers last reported improving employment conditions in February 2023, indicating that hiring has not yet fully recovered.

China's youth unemployment rate fell to 17.6% in September, down from 18.8% in August, according to official data. This decline is a relief for officials after youth unemployment hit fresh highs for two straight months. However, a separate survey showed that factory owners continued to hold off on hiring last month, indicating that employment conditions may not be improving as quickly as expected. The unemployment rate for 25-to-29-year olds was 6.7%, and 3.9% for people between 30 and 59 years of age. Officials expressed confidence that the economy would 'continue the stabilisation and recovery trend that occurred in September,' but the data suggests that more work is needed to address the issue of youth unemployment.

**China's rising youth unemployment signals the nation's economic woes are far from over**
China's youth unemployment rate has been rising, reaching a new high of 18.8% in August. This is a concern for economists, as it indicates the nation's economic woes are far from over. The rate of urban youth unemployment has been a commonly-cited gauge of the country's financial stability. The government has amended the data points to exclude students, releasing a lower urban youth unemployment rate, but this figure is on the rise again. Some of the reasons for China's youth unemployment include an economic slowdown, growing numbers of people pursuing higher education, and weak consumer and employer confidence. According to Bert Hofman, professor at the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, 'People that entered university four years ago may have planned for a future in finance or app development, but now need to get a job in manufacturing.' The youth unemployment rate in China is notably worse than in other nations, with the International Labour Organization reporting a 13.9% youth unemployment rate for Asia and the Pacific in 2023. Economists and analysts look to youth unemployment rates for insight because they are more prone to fluctuations that can hint at corporate confidence and hiring trends.

**China's Youth Unemployment Becomes a Global Problem**
China's high youth unemployment is becoming a problem not only for the country itself but also for other nations, including Germany. According to Maximilian Butek from the German Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, 'it's mainly economic reasons' that drive people from China to the US. Many young people in China see no future for themselves, and the country's youth unemployment rate is at a record high, with 21.3% of 16- to 24-year-olds without a job in June 2024. The situation is so dire that the Chinese government has stopped publishing the statistics, only to resume them in December 2023, excluding students from the count. Nicole Goldin from the Atlantic Council believes that 'there are simply not enough jobs for all the young people coming out of university.' With nearly 12 million university graduates entering the job market this year, the country's economy is struggling to keep up, with a growth rate of only 4.7% in the second quarter of 2024. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that China's growth will slow down to 3.3% by 2029 due to various factors, including the ongoing crisis in the real estate sector, declining productivity, and an aging population. This could lead to China exporting its problems, such as youth unemployment, to other countries, including Africa, where Chinese companies are building infrastructure projects with Chinese workers. For Germany, this could mean a decline in Chinese imports, which have already decreased by 10% in 2023.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits New Record High**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached a new record high of 18.8% in August, according to official data, marking the second consecutive month of a new maximum, despite the authorities using a new statistical method. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced that the unemployment rate among people aged 16-24 living in urban areas of China increased from 17.1% in July to 18.8% in August. The NBS also published the unemployment rate for young people aged 25-29, excluding students, which stood at 6.9% in August, a 0.4 percentage point increase from July. The NBS changed its methodology in January to exclude students from the youth unemployment rate, which had reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023. The new method aims to provide more accurate employment services and formulate more effective and targeted employment policies for young people. 'The calculation of the unemployment rate by age group, excluding students, better reflects the employment and unemployment situation of young people entering society,' said the NBS. The global urban unemployment rate in China stood at 5.3% in August, slightly higher than the 5.1% recorded in July. China is under pressure to increase job creation and employment.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Reaches 18.8% in August**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached 18.8% in August, the highest level this year, as the country struggles to revitalize its ailing economy. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate among young people aged 16-24 years old, not enrolled in education, increased to 18.8% in August, up from 17.1% in July. The expected unemployment rate for June 2023 was 21.3%, but the authorities stopped publishing it and are working on revising their approach by no longer counting students. With around 12 million students graduating from Chinese universities in June 2024, the competition in the job market has increased, making it difficult for job seekers. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in May that combating youth unemployment should be a 'top priority'. The unemployment rate among those aged 25-29 years old increased from 6.5% in July to 6.9% in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The release of August's unemployment numbers comes after disappointing data on retail sales and industrial production growth, which slowed down in the same month. These indicators once again highlight the challenges Beijing faces in restarting its economy sustainably, despite efforts to do so. The National Bureau of Statistics said in a previous statement that 'the negative effects of the current changes in the external environment are intensifying, and domestic demand is still insufficient, and the economy is still facing many difficulties and challenges as it continues to recover'.

The unemployment rate for those aged 16 to 24 who are not in school rose from 17.1% in July.

**China's Youth Unemployment Crisis: Rising Challenges Amid Economic Slowdown**
China is facing a growing youth unemployment crisis, with the unemployment rate among individuals aged 16 to 24 reaching 18.8% in August, the highest level since December 2022. The influx of new graduates and economic deceleration are major contributing factors. Liu Aihua, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, attributed the surge in unemployment to the graduate season. The economic slowdown has exacerbated the crisis, with many young people forced to accept low-wage jobs or remain unemployed. The Chinese government's restructuring of key sectors, including technology and private education, has also had unintended consequences, such as stifling innovation and leading to layoffs. The labor market faces structural challenges, with emerging sectors like AI and green energy not creating as many jobs as traditional industries. Many Chinese youths have adopted new coping strategies, including the 'tang ping' or 'lying flat' movement, where young people reject societal pressures to achieve conventional success. The government has made job creation a top priority, but experts believe that more comprehensive reforms are needed to address the underlying structural issues.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits Record High**
China is facing a growing unemployment crisis, with the youth unemployment rate reaching 18.8% in August, the highest level since the beginning of the year. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate among young people aged 16-24, not enrolled in education, increased to 18.8% from 17.1% in July. The expected unemployment rate for June 2023 was 21.3%, but the authorities stopped publishing it and are working to adjust their approach by no longer counting students. This indicates the significant economic challenges facing China, which requires immediate measures to revitalize the economy and create new job opportunities.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Reaches Highest Level This Year**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached its highest level this year, reaching 18.8% in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. This is despite the government's efforts to revitalize its struggling economy. The unemployment rate among young people aged 16-24 who are not in education increased to 17.1% in July, from 16.4% in June. The expected unemployment rate in June 2023 was 21.3%, but the authorities stopped publishing it and are working on revising their approach by no longer counting students. The graduation of around 12 million students from Chinese universities in June 2024 has increased competition in the Chinese job market, making it difficult for job seekers. This explains the sharp increase in unemployment rates in July. In May, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that combating youth unemployment should be a 'top priority'. The unemployment rate among people aged 25-29 increased from 6.5% in July to 6.9% in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The release of August's unemployment figures comes after the release of disappointing data on retail sales and industrial production growth, which slowed down in the same month. These indicators once again highlight the challenges that Beijing faces in restarting its economy sustainably, despite its efforts.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Reaches New Record High in August**
According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China, the youth unemployment rate in August 2024 reached a new record high. The unemployment rate for the 16-24 age group increased from 17.1% in July to 18.8% in August. The unemployment rate for the 25-29 age group also increased from 6.5% in July to 6.9% in August. The youth unemployment rate has reached its highest level since the new calculation method was introduced in December 2023. The NBS had previously stopped releasing youth unemployment data by age group after it reached a record high of 21.3% in July 2023. The new calculation method excludes students who are still in education, including high school and university students. The summer months are a time when young graduates are preparing to enter the workforce, which is why the youth unemployment rate is often high during this period, said the NBS.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits Record High**
China's youth unemployment rate has increased to 18.8% in August, its highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (ONE). This rate is more than three times higher than the overall unemployment rate, which rose to 5.3% in the eighth month of the year. The ONE had previously suspended the publication of youth unemployment data in the second half of last year due to a change in its calculation method to exclude university students. Before this change, the youth unemployment rate had reached 21.3% in June 2023. The alarming increase in youth unemployment in China reflects the country's economic challenges. The ONE's data highlights the need for effective measures to address this issue, which is exacerbated by the country's economic restructuring, aging population, and delayed retirement age. To tackle this problem, the Chinese government should implement policies and programs that promote job creation and improve employability among young people, such as investing in their education and training, providing incentives to companies that hire young people, and supporting entrepreneurship and business initiatives. These measures, along with a comprehensive strategy to address the various factors contributing to youth unemployment, will be crucial to mitigating this issue and ensuring a more prosperous future for young Chinese people.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Surges to 18.8% in August**
China's youth unemployment rate has surged to 18.8% in August, its highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (ONE). This rate, which refers to registered unemployment among citizens aged 16-24, excluding university students, is more than three times higher than the overall unemployment rate, which rose to 5.3% in the eighth month of the year. The publication of youth unemployment data was suspended for most of the second half of last year after the ONE announced a revision to its calculation method to exclude the weight of university students. Before that, in June 2023, the rate reached 21.3%. Additionally, in August, inactivity among people aged 25-29, excluding those in higher education, increased by 0.4% to 6.9%, while the rate for those aged 30-59 remained stable at 3.9%. The Chinese government has announced plans to raise the retirement age for the first time since 1978, allowing men to retire at 63 and women in physically demanding and skilled jobs to retire at 58, up from 55. This change will be implemented over the next 15 years, starting from 2025.

**China's Youth Unemployment Crisis: A Complex Problem with Multiple Causes**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached a record high of 21.3% in May 2023, prompting the government to stop publishing statistics. After excluding students from the survey, the unemployment rate among young people decreased by almost a third in December. However, the problem persists, and in July 2024, the number of young unemployed people increased by a third to 17.1%. Analyst Jiayu Li notes that the official numbers do not accurately capture the situation, as they exclude millions of rural workers who face greater challenges in finding full-time employment. The government's repression of the technology, real estate, and private education sectors in 2020/21 has also contributed to the problem. The sectors have lost over $1 trillion in market value, and the private education sector, which offered part-time jobs to around 75 million students, has been decimated. Many of those affected were young workers. The government's focus on emerging sectors such as AI and electric vehicles, which do not require many new workers, has also stifled innovation and technological progress. The continuous tensions with the West have also put pressure on China's export sector, which needs to substitute high-value and low-risk orders from the West with lower-value orders from the Global South. This has an impact on employment. The rise of the 'tang ping' movement, where young people reject social pressures and opt for a more relaxed life, has also contributed to the problem. Many young people are choosing to become 'professional children or grandchildren' to care for their elderly relatives, a function in high demand due to the aging population and increasing care costs. The government's strict regulations have also made entrepreneurs and venture capitalists 'extremely cautious' and unwilling to take risks, leading to a 97% decline in new startups in the past six years. Economist Diana Choyleva notes that this is a 'serious contradiction with the government's agenda.' The high youth unemployment rate reduces productivity and will make it difficult for China to compete globally. It will also prevent young people from entering the middle class, which will have implications for consumption and social stability.
