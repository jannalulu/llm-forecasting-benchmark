**Trump's Legacy Will Live On: New Poll Shows Top Contenders for 2028**
A new poll by Echelon Insights suggests that Donald Trump's legacy will continue to shape American politics, with his vice president pick, J.D. Vance, and Vice President Kamala Harris emerging as top contenders for the 2028 presidential race. According to the poll, Vance garnered 37% of Republican votes, while Harris topped the Democrat side with 41%. The poll also highlights the ascension of Vance as the face of 'Trumpism without Trump' and the lack of moderate candidates on the Democrat side, with most of the top contenders being unelectable progressives or Biden-Harris apparatchiks. As one author notes, 'The GOP under Trump isn't just different, it's more dynamic and more resilient. Democrats, meanwhile, are convinced that getting trounced wasn't a referendum on their policies or their people, the voters just made a mistake which absolutely won't happen again.'

**Trump's Support Grows Significantly in 2024 Election**
Donald Trump received 2.5 million more votes than he did in 2020, according to an analysis by the Associated Press. This increase in support is a concerning trend for Democrats, as Trump's popularity has grown significantly since his last presidential campaign. Trump won a higher percentage of votes in all 50 states, as well as Washington D.C., compared to his previous election. He also received more actual votes in 40 states. The analysis notes that the decline in votes for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, which was over 7 million votes compared to Joe Biden's 2020 performance, was a significant factor in her loss, particularly in urban areas of swing states that were considered Democratic strongholds. 'The decline in votes for Harris was a major factor in her loss,' said the analysis. 'It was a clear indication that Trump's support has grown significantly since his last campaign.'

**Emerson Poll: Trump Favorability Jumps Post-Election**
The first post-election Emerson College poll finds President-elect Donald Trump's favorability rating at 54%, a six-point increase from his pre-election favorability of 48%. President Joe Biden has a 36% job approval rating, a four-year low for the president in Emerson polls. Trump's favorability varies significantly by gender, race, and age, with 60% of voters 40-59 viewing him favorably, and 55% of those under 30 expressing a favorable opinion. Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said, 'There is a sharp difference in reaction to the election results based on who voters supported: 67% of Harris voters were surprised by the results, while 71% of Trump voters were not surprised by his victory.' In the 2028 primary, Vice President and 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris leads with 37%, while 30% support Vice President-elect JD Vance in the Republican Primary. A majority of 2028 Republican primary voters (51%) are undecided.

**New Poll: Majority of Americans Approve Trump Transition**
A recent poll by Echelon Insights, in partnership with Puck News, found that 53% of registered voters approve of Donald Trump's handling of the transition, while only 40% disapprove. This is a significant improvement from previous polls, with Trump's favorability rating reaching a +20, a record for him. The poll also found that a majority of Americans (51%) have an unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party, and Trump's favorability rating (49%) is higher than those of Kamala Harris (47%) and President Joe Biden (42%). The Republican Party is now viewed more favorably (48%) than the Democratic Party (44%). According to the poll, voters are giving Trump the benefit of the doubt, with 58% saying it's likely the country will start to head in a better direction in 2025. Echelon Insights' Matt Vespa noted that Trump has never scored a +13 on either job approval or favorability before, and that this poll is a significant departure from previous trends.

**Trump Favorability Rating Weekly Update (11/17/2024)**
The president-elect's favorability rating is slightly improving, but still remains underwater. Over the past year, it averages -10.65 points, barely changing from last week's -10.87 points. However, the month-long average has improved to -5.9 points, with last week's average at -6.5 points. Despite this, most Americans still hold an unfavorable opinion of the president-elect, with the most popular sentiment being 'very unfavorable'. According to the author, this is due to the normalization of the president-elect since his election, with people trying to rationalize America's decision until his policies and cabinet are scrutinized.

**Shocked by Trump’s Win? Look at the Exit Polls**
Donald Trump's decisive victory in the 2024 election can be attributed to several key factors, including his strong favorability among parents, married voters, and working-class individuals. Exit polling data reveals that Trump won the working-class vote decisively, with 60% of voters in this demographic favoring him. He also held a strong advantage among voters without a bachelor's degree, with double-digit leads among those who never attended college and voters with an associate degree. Additionally, Trump's pro-life stance was a stronger motivator than the pro-choice platform, with 91% of voters who oppose legal abortion casting their vote for him. Harris, on the other hand, lost ground among female voters, dropping 4% from Biden's 57% to 53%, and faced a devastating loss among Latina women, with support slipping from 69% in 2020 to 60% in 2024. The exit polling data also highlights the importance of economic anxiety, with one in three voters ranking the economy as their top concern and those with a negative view of the U.S. economic situation favoring Trump by a substantial 42% margin.

**Election Day 2024 live results: The 7 swing states have yet to be projected**
The 2024 presidential election is ongoing, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in a close contest. According to 538's forecast, both candidates have a roughly equal chance to win. Harris is leading in some key states, but Trump is expected to win North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. In Georgia, Trump is leading by 6 points, while in Texas, he is leading by 8 points. In New Hampshire, Harris is leading by 9 points. The outcome of Ohio's Senate race is crucial for control of the Senate, with Democrat Sherrod Brown leading Republican Bernie Moreno by 2%. In North Carolina, the presidential race is too close to project, with Trump slightly favored to win. Democratic Senate candidates have often overperformed their party's presidential candidate in polling this cycle. Recent history suggests that this overperformance is a good sign for them, but it's not a sure thing. The election is still too close to call, with many states still reporting votes.

**538's final forecasts for the 2024 election**
According to 538's final election forecasts, the presidency and House of Representatives are toss-ups, while the GOP is likely to win the Senate. The presidential election is extremely close, with Vice President Kamala Harris having a 50-in-100 chance of winning the Electoral College and former President Donald Trump having a 49-in-100 chance. The margin between the two candidates is less than 2.1 percentage points in all seven swing states. The House of Representatives is also uncertain, with Democrats having a 51-in-100 chance of taking control. However, the median outcome in the forecast is that Democrats win just a one-seat majority. The Senate, on the other hand, is decidedly not close, with Republicans having a 92-in-100 chance of winning control of the upper chamber.

**Trump on the brink of a comeback for the ages - Washington Examiner**
Former President Donald Trump is on the brink of a historic comeback, with his favorability rating increasing by nearly 10 points to 43.7% according to the latest polling averages. Despite facing numerous challenges, including two impeachments, criminal charges, and assassination attempts, Trump's resilience and determination have made him stronger in the eyes of his supporters. Republican strategist Zack Roday said, 'If you look at his image around the country, he's never been stronger despite everything that has been thrown at him.' Trump's supporters see his legal troubles as a proxy attack on them, and his mug shot has become a campaign asset. Trump's comeback is one of the most unlikely examples of political staying power in American history, and if he wins the 2024 election, it will be considered the greatest political comeback in American history.

**Signs Kamala Harris could win are "clear as day" -- election forecaster**
CNN data analyst Harry Enten believes that Vice President Kamala Harris will win the 2024 presidential election, citing her higher favorability rating and the importance of abortion as a key issue. Enten noted that Harris' net favorability rating is higher than Donald Trump's, with a -2 point difference compared to Trump's -7 points. He also pointed out that in 16 out of the past 17 elections, the more popular candidate won, with the exception of Donald Trump in 2016. Additionally, Enten reviewed special elections in 2023 and 2024, finding that Democrats have surpassed Joe Biden's 2020 margin by 2 points on average. He emphasized that while the country's approval ratings are low, Democrats historically do well in elections when abortion is a major issue.

**Trump and Harris are both a normal polling error away from a blowout**
The 2024 presidential election between Trump and Harris is uncertain, but the outcome may not be close. According to 538's election forecasting model, Trump has a 52-in-100 chance of winning the White House, while Harris has a 48-in-100 chance. The model estimates that the average polling error in competitive states will be 3.8 points on the margin, which is similar to the error in 2020. However, the direction of polling error is impossible to predict in advance, and polls have overestimated Republicans plenty of times in the past. If the polls are off, it could benefit either candidate, and the outcome could be a blowout win for either Trump or Harris. The model reckons Harris needs to win the popular vote by 2.1 points to be favored to win the election, while Trump would be favored to win in a blowout if he wins the popular vote by 1-2 points. However, the news is not all good, as pollsters are still reporting difficulty reaching voters at all, and Trump supporters may still be less likely to respond to polls.

A CNBC poll also shows Trump leading in the seven battleground states, with 48% of voters supporting Trump and 47% supporting Harris. The polls indicate that economic issues are a major concern for voters, with Trump having a strong advantage on this issue. In Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state, Trump is leading in the final sprint, with a 50-49 lead among likely voters in the Franklin and Marshall College poll. However, Harris has an edge among all registered voters in the state, with 48% support compared to Trump's 44%.

**U.S. Presidential Race: Gallup Poll Reveals Historic Unpopularity of Trump and Harris**
A recent Gallup poll has revealed that both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have historic unpopularity, with 50% and 48% favorability ratings respectively. This is the lowest level of favorability for any presidential candidate in the past 70 years. Despite this, Trump's favorability has risen significantly from 36% in 2016, while Kamala's rating is comparable to some of the lowest in history. The poll suggests a shift in voter sentiment and widespread discontent, with both candidates struggling to gain trust beyond their core base. The implications for the 2024 election are significant, with low participation and a surge in 3rd-party interest possible. As Jeffrey M. Jones, Senior Writer at Gallup, noted, 'the majority of past presidential candidates scored 60% favorability even when they did not win.'

**Shock poll reveals leader in 2024 race with just 12 days to go**
A recent poll by the Wall Street Journal shows Donald Trump leading Kamala Harris by 47% to 45%, just 12 days before the election. Harris' favorability ratings have collapsed, with 53% of voters viewing her unfavorably and only 45% viewing her favorably. Trump, on the other hand, has seen a significant improvement in his favorability ratings, with 52% approving of his presidency and 48% disapproving. Harris is only favored on issues such as abortion and protecting social security and medicare, while Trump is seen as the more trusted candidate on issues like immigration, the economy, inflation, and Israel's war against Hamas. Harris called Trump a 'fascist' and dodged questions on the effectiveness of a border wall during a CNN town hall, while Trump referred to John Kelly, his former Chief of Staff, as a 'degenerate' and a 'lowlife' after Kelly said Trump fit the bill of a fascist. Trump also campaigned in the Bible Belt and spoke about his faith, saying that it is a 'big advantage' over people who don't have it. Harris received more bad news when it was revealed that billionaire Warren Buffett will not be endorsing her or Trump for president in 2024.

**Election polls 2024 live: Three experts make shocking final predictions in the election**
With 13 days until the election, three experts have made final predictions on whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris will win. Allan Lichtman, known as the 'Nostradamus' of election forecasting, still believes Harris will be victorious. Nate Silver, a polling guru, says it's a 50/50 dead heat, but his 'gut' tells him Trump will triumph. James Carville, a veteran political strategist, is now 'certain' Harris will win. Early voting is already in full force, with nearly 19 million Americans having cast their ballots. Harris will participate in a CNN town hall moderated by Anderson Cooper tonight at 9 p.m. ET in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Harris has a huge fundraising advantage over Trump, with her campaign raising over $1 billion since she entered the race. Trump's Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, said Trump 'certainly' has fascist 'inclinations.' The Quinnipiac University poll shows Harris leading Trump in Michigan, 49-46, and tied in Wisconsin. Harris's favorability rating is now dead-even in Michigan, 48-48, according to a new Quinnipiac University poll. In neighboring Wisconsin, she is slightly underwater, with 46 percent viewing her favorably compared to a 48 percent unfavorable rating. Trump, who has long been underwater nationally, has a respectable 47 to 48 favorability rating in Wisconsin, essentially the same as Harris. In Michigan, where Harris is performing slightly better, 46 percent view Trump favorably compared to a 52 percent majority who view him unfavorably. The Rust Belt numbers follow a Gallup poll showing Harris hitting a near record low on favorability nationwide. She began her campaign with positive favorables after stepping in for Joe Biden. She has a 48 percent favorability, below Joe Biden's 54 percent four years ago. Trump has a 50 percent favorability rating in the poll. Kamala Harris is getting support on the prediction site Kalshi. The site said there has been a 'massive' influx of backing for the Vice President today. But Donald Trump is still the clear favorite on the site. Harris warned that Trump was 'increasingly unhinged and unstable.' In a second term, people like John Kelly will not be there to be the guardrails against his propensities and his actions. Those who once tried to stop him from pursuing his worst impulses would no longer be there. And no longer be there to rein him in. Harris warned that Trump wanted 'unchecked power' if elected president again. 'The question in 13 days will be what do the American people want?' she concluded. Harris did not take questions from the press.

**Trump reaches new popularity heights during third run for White House - Washington Examiner**
A Gallup poll has shown that 50% of adults rate Donald Trump favorably, compared to 48% who rate him unfavorably, marking a higher favorability rating than in 2020 and 2016. Vice President Kamala Harris holds a net negative favorable rating, with 50% of adults rating her unfavorably and 48% rating her favorably. Trump's 2024 ratings rank among the lowest in the Gallup poll dating back to 1956. However, he is polling better than Harris in favorability ratings and projections for who will win the most important states. Trump is leading Harris nationally in the RealClearPolitics polling average, 49.3%-48.5%, and is also leading in all of the battleground states. 'The 2024 Gallup poll also showed that Trump had a higher favorable rating than his opponent, something he did not have in 2016 or 2020,' according to the Washington Examiner. 'Trump is polling better than Harris in favorability ratings and projections for who will win the most important states,' the article adds.

**How America's 'double haters' could send Trump back to the White House**
Pundits are analyzing head-to-head polling numbers to predict the outcome of the presidential race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. However, looking at the candidates' favorability numbers may provide a clearer picture. Historically, a presidential candidate's favorability rating is highly correlated with their ultimate share of the vote. In 2016, Trump won the 'double haters' - those who disliked both him and Hillary Clinton - by a 17-point margin. In 2020, Trump lost because almost everyone liked one of the two nominees. The 2024 election is shaping up to be similar, with Trump having a 45% favorability rating and Harris having a 49.3% rating. However, head-to-head polling numbers show a Harris lead of only 2.4 percentage points. This suggests that Harris is losing the 'double haters' and that Trump needs to drive anti-Harris sentiment up. The October polls also suggest that Trump needs to change the composition of the voter pool by driving turnout higher. If Trump can bring Harris' favorability down and energize his low-engagement voters, he can build coattails that could boost Senate and House Republican numbers significantly.

**How America’s ‘double haters’ could send Trump back to the White House**
Pundits are looking at head-to-head polling numbers to predict the outcome of the 2024 presidential election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. However, a closer look at the candidates' favorability ratings reveals a different story. Historically, a presidential candidate's favorability rating is highly correlated with their ultimate share of the vote. In 2016 and 2020, almost all voters who had a favorable opinion of a candidate voted for that person. Trump won the 2016 election by carrying the 'double haters' - those who disliked both him and Hillary Clinton - by a 17-point margin. However, in 2020, Trump lost the popular vote by only 4.5%, suggesting that he again won the 'double haters' but on Election Day there were too few of them to matter. The 2024 election is shaping up to be similar, with Harris having a higher favorability rating than Trump among likely voters. However, head-to-head horserace numbers show a Harris lead of only 2.4 percentage points, suggesting that Trump is losing the 'double haters' by a significant margin. Strategically, this means that Trump needs to drive anti-Harris sentiment up as high as possible and change the composition of the voter pool by driving turnout higher.

**The Political Report – October 20, 2024**
The 538 forecast has Donald Trump leading with a 52% chance of winning, while Kamala Harris is still favored to win the popular vote. However, a few good polls for Harris could easily put her back in the lead. A new East Carolina University poll in Georgia finds Trump leading among likely voters, 49% to 46%. A new TIPP poll also shows Trump ahead 49% to 48%. A Generation Lab poll found that 43% of people between 18 and 34 would have a more negative view of a date if they voted for Trump, while 17% would have a more positive view. In contrast, 19% would have a negative view of a date who voted for Kamala Harris, 32% would view it positively, and 49% would be indifferent. Gallup reported that Americans continue to register record-low trust in the mass media, with 31% expressing a 'great deal' or 'fair amount' of confidence in the media to report the news 'fully, accurately and fairly.' The article also discusses various Senate and House races, including the Virginia 10th District, where Democrat Suhas Subramanyam has the endorsement of Barbara Comstock, a former Republican. Additionally, the article mentions the Oregon Referendum, where supporters of ranked-choice voting have outraised their opponents $4 million to $1,000. In the Washington Land Commissioner race, Democrat Dave Upthegrove is leading Republican Jaime Herrera Beutler 41-35. The article also discusses various other Senate and House races, including the Arizona 2nd District, where freshman Republican Rep. Eli Crane is deadlocked 42-42 against his Democratic foe, former Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez.

**Trump Takes an Edge in Two Election Forecasts**
Donald Trump has taken a 52% to 48% lead in the 538 forecast, but Kamala Harris is still favored to win the popular vote. According to G. Elliot Morris, 'You might be tempted to make a big deal about our forecast 'flipping' to Trump, but it's important to remember that a 52-in-100 chance for Trump is not all that different from a 58-in-100 chance for Harris — both are little better than a coin flip for the leading candidate.' Morris notes that Trump has gained ground, but a few good polls for Harris could put her back in the lead, and the overall characterization of the race remains a toss-up.

**State of the Race: It's all about turnout**
Election analyst Nate Silver's model has shifted in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris, giving her a 55% chance of winning the Electoral College to Donald Trump's 45%. However, nothing has changed in the past two weeks, and the number of undecided voters is extremely low, at 4%. According to CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten, this is the lowest level of undecideds seen in polling at this point in the 21st century. The article argues that the election has become a turnout election, and the side that outworks the other will win. The focus should be on how close Harris is to 50% in key battleground states, and whether she has a ceiling of support. Harris has largely reversed her previously negative favorability ratings, and is now in net-favorable territory, according to 538's average.
