**2024 Could Become the Hottest Year on Record, Warns OMM Report**
A World Meteorological Organization (OMM) report released during the COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, warns that 2024 could become the hottest year on record. The 'State of the Climate' document highlights that the decade of 2015-2024 is the warmest since records began. The global average temperature has exceeded previous values for 16 consecutive months, from June 2023 to September 2024. Between January and September 2024, the average air temperature was 1.54°C above the pre-industrial average, surpassing the critical threshold of the Paris Agreement. According to the report, the temporary increase is 'concerning' as it may put the Earth in a 'danger zone', but it is estimated that the long-term temperature rise will be around 1.3°C. The report also notes that 2023 saw a record level of greenhouse gas emissions, with a trend of increase expected in 2024. The content of heat in the oceans, responsible for absorbing about 90% of the global excess heat, has reached record levels. Additionally, the accelerated melting of glaciers contributes to the rise in sea level, which is now growing more than twice the rate observed between 1993 and 2002. The OMM emphasizes the urgency of taking action to mitigate climate change before the 1.5°C threshold is permanently exceeded. 'Each fraction of a degree of warming matters, as it intensifies extreme weather events and causes catastrophic losses,' the organization says. 'It is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve climate adaptation strategies.'

**A shadow ‘financial crisis’ has cost the world $2 trillion**
A new report from the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) estimates that the total economic damage from climate-related extreme weather events globally was approximately $2 trillion between 2014 and 2023. This is roughly in line with the economic toll of the 2008 global financial crisis. The report, released ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, warns that the economic impact of climate change necessitates a swift and decisive response from governments. According to the report, approximately 1.6 billion people were affected by these weather events, and economic damages reached $451 billion in 2022 and 2023, a 19% increase compared to the annual average from the previous eight years. John W.H. Denton AO, the secretary general of the ICC, said, 'The data from the past decade shows definitively that climate change is not a future problem: the productivity losses from extreme weather events are being felt in the here and now by the real economy.'

**Extreme weather cost $2tn globally over past decade, report finds**
A report commissioned by the International Chamber of Commerce found that extreme weather events have cost the world $2 trillion over the past decade, with the US suffering the greatest economic losses at $935 billion, followed by China at $268 billion and India at $112 billion. The report's findings come as world leaders argue over how much rich countries should pay to help poor countries adapt to a hotter world and deal with the damage done by increasingly violent weather. According to John Denton, secretary-general of the ICC, 'The data from the past decade shows definitively that climate change is not a future problem. Major productivity losses from extreme weather events are being felt in the here and now by the real economy.' Ilan Noy, a disaster economist, cautioned that the report's numbers may miss the impact of extreme weather on poor communities and vulnerable countries. 'The main caveat is that these numbers actually miss the impact where it truly matters, in poor communities and in vulnerable countries,' he said. The ICC urged world leaders to act faster to get money to countries that need help to cut their pollution and develop in ways that can withstand the shocks of violent weather.

**Vilfand: Probability of 2024 Being the Warmest Year on Record Increases**
The probability of 2024 becoming the warmest year on record is increasing, according to Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center. 'The probability of 2024 being the warmest year is increasing. This is due to the fact that the 2023-2024 El Niño event was very intense, which led to an increase in sea surface temperature in mid-latitudes. The temperature of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is record-high for the entire period of observation, and this has been ongoing for 15 months. This transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere is causing the global temperature to rise,' Vilfand explained. He noted that the main cause of warming is the increase in greenhouse gases, which prevent the long-wave radiation from the Earth's surface from being released. 'Currently, it is being delayed by this greenhouse gas, and its concentration is not decreasing, which is the main problem with warming,' he added. Vilfand also stated that, based on data from the World Meteorological Organization, 2024 is likely to be the first year when the average global temperature exceeds the pre-industrial period temperature norm by 1.5 degrees. 'This is a threshold value, it is marked in the Paris Agreement, we need to strive for the temperature increase not to exceed 1.5 degrees by the end of the century. Therefore, yes, this year is likely to be the warmest,' Vilfand explained.

**Atac: A New World from January 1, 2025, Says Rome's Mobility Assessor**
Rome's Mobility Assessor Eugenio Patanè said, 'From January 1, 2025, with the introduction of the new Service Contract, there will be a new world for Atac.' He presented the delibera on the in-house assignment of the tpl of Rome to Atac and the guidelines of the new Service Contract in the Capitolina Assembly. Patanè stated, 'The company came out of the preventive concordat in 2023 - an unexpected success because recovering 171 million euros in debts to creditors was a significant effort. Atac's response was fantastic, as for the first time in decades, we closed the balance in profit, 11 million euros. This means opening a new world also from an operational point of view. We said that three years were needed: 2022, '23, and '24, to put a normal situation back in order. We hadn't bought trams, we hadn't refurbished the trains, we hadn't refurbished the tracks. In 70 years, only one tram depot had been built, at Porta Maggiore, and when you have to rebuild it because the new trams are longer, you have to stop all the lines. That's the condition in which we had to work. That's why I said that 2024 would be the zero year: the metro A that closes at 21 for an investment, and not for a service disruption, the metro C that is in pre-operation until September 2025.' However, these works and construction sites will end in December 2024. From January 20, 2025, when all tram lines will reopen and from December 8, the metro A will reopen until 23:30, the substitute services will no longer be necessary - concluded Patanè. We will have in 2025 the year one of transportation, in which we will recover normality and be able to work for excellence. And this cannot mean going into a prorogation at the same terms and conditions, because it would mean assigning the company to a natural deficit. Approving the Cds means putting the company in a position to make new investments.'

**Nicolle with Ruhle and Sorkin on Fortune Mag story.**
The CEOs' assumption that any problems created by a potential Trump administration will be temporary and resolve after one or two elections is a 'dangerous assumption.' The people around Trump, the '2025' conspirators, have no intention of allowing a return to normal, and with the SCOTUS captive, they won't have to. The 2024 election is NOT a normal election, and if Trump wins, we may not have a 'normal' election for a generation or two. The author warns that an American oligarchy could have the advantage of more technological and professional resources than the USSR, emerging from a feudal society after suffering defeat in WWI, and could realize all the worst projections of dystopian science fiction. 'It's not easy to flip the switch back, once it's been flipped in the wrong direction,' and that may not be pessimistic enough.

**Here are some potentially habitable world targets for the upcoming LIFE mission**
A recent paper published in Research Notes of the AAS outlines the criteria for prioritizing targets for the upcoming LIFE mission, which aims to search for life beyond Earth. The team has identified three groups of potentially habitable world targets: the first consists of main-sequence stars within 30 parsecs of Earth, the second group consists of star systems positioned in a region of the sky best suited for observation by LIFE and HWO, and the third group consists of the 'Golden Targets,' which are systems known to have potentially habitable planets with atmospheres and excellent observing conditions. According to the paper, there are currently about ten systems in the 'Golden Targets' group, but future observations are likely to add more to the list before LIFE and HWO are launched. 'These are the priority targets for these missions,' said the team. 'They offer the best chance of finding evidence of extraterrestrial life.'

**The World in 2024: A Western-Style Disorder**
The world of today bears a resemblance to the western movies of the past. These films were very popular and celebrated over two or three decades ago, telling a story of conquest and administration of justice based on personal criteria, due to the lack of institutions and legality. However, as time passed, these films fell out of favor and were replaced by other concepts of local and universal history. The conquest of the west is no longer seen as a solely civilizing gesture, but also as a component of despoilment and racism. In the old west, the law of the strongest prevailed, and when the law and order could not be imposed, armed outlaws would do as they pleased. This led to the emergence of films, series, and novels that told stories of heroes and villains, with a clear distinction between good and evil. In today's world, there is no international institution capable of imposing order among nations. International organizations are dominated by majorities that have already negotiated agreements, and solidarity is shown towards causes that are not in the common good. As a result, many countries and situations are left without support. The United Nations has not issued a binding decision in any recent conflict. Condemnations, resolutions, and declarations come and go, but international order is governed by anarchy. In this world, the authority of a powerful empire or country should impose itself. It's not ideal, nor is it the most just, but it's the most viable. The United States once played this role, but now seems to be renouncing it, leaving a power vacuum that is filled with more disorder. More countries and regimes have the resources to impose themselves locally, causing damage globally with little control over their actions and even less over their internal affairs. The international organizations are left with declarations that are largely ineffective and trying to control and minimize damage with little success. As we approach the US elections, it's unclear what role the first power will play in the world order or disorder. The thesis of not getting involved in conflicts that are not directly related to them is theoretically correct, but the lack of institutionalization and respect at the global level generates insecurity in many regions. The situation in Ukraine and the Middle East is not being resolved and is becoming more complicated by the day. Like in the old west, a few just actions seem to restore order, apply the law, and achieve justice. This pleases the audience, but it's not a solution, just a necessary and welcome band-aid.

**NASA Confirms Stephen Hawking's Prediction: The End of the World in 2600?**
Stephen Hawking predicted in the documentary 'The Search for a New Earth' that humanity will be able to inhabit the Earth until 2600, at which point it will become 'a gigantic ball of fire' due to global warming, climate change, and the greenhouse effect. NASA has confirmed this theory, stating that if humans continue to deplete energy resources at the current rate, the end of the world will come sooner than expected. NASA is taking action to prevent this by implementing programs to protect the planet from within and from space, including monitoring climate change and identifying potential threats such as asteroid impacts. As NASA's spokesperson said, 'If urgent action is not taken, the disappearance of our planet will be inevitable.'

**Global Oceans Remain Abnormally Warm Despite End of El Niño**
The world's oceans remain abnormally warm despite the end of El Niño, which has raised concerns. The global temperature continues to rise, and the state of the sea ice is alarming. In 2023, the sea ice reached a historic minimum. While the Northern Hemisphere is cooling with the arrival of winter and the Arctic is refreezing, the sea ice is increasing at this time of year. However, this year's recovery seems laborious, to the point where a record for this time of year is being discussed. The relationship between water temperature and sea ice extent is clear: the warmer the water, the more ice melts. In 2023, records were broken in this regard, as the surface water had never been as warm. This situation has persisted until July 2024, with a slight decline observed since then. The Earth's climate system is complex, and the interaction between the atmosphere and water represents a positive feedback loop. The air is warming, and the oceans and vice versa. The global surface air temperature shattered records in 2023, and there is a good chance that 2024 will break the record, but 2023 remains slightly warmer at this date. According to NOAA estimates, a transition to a new La Nina episode seems to be taking place. It could be of short duration and low intensity. The global trend will be worth watching in the coming months.

**World Future Council 2024 Kicks Off in Dubai with Over 500 Experts**
The annual meeting of the World Future Council 2024 has started in Dubai, bringing together over 500 experts from the business, government, academic, and civil society sectors to share perspectives, participate in creative brainstorming sessions, and generate ideas to support future decisions, in the face of complex challenges facing the world. The council will discuss main topics such as 'innovation for comprehensive growth, climate action and nature protection, energy transition, building trust for global cooperation, food and water security, and artificial intelligence'. Maroun Khoury, Director of the Middle East and North Africa at the World Economic Forum, said, 'Dubai, thanks to its strategy based on innovation and sustainable development, has provided an ideal environment to promote cooperation between governments, the private sector, and the academic community, and embodies its ambitious vision and efforts to provide effective solutions to problems like climate change and food security.' He added, 'The steps taken by Dubai and the United Arab Emirates in the field of artificial intelligence and digital transformation in recent years qualify it to be a global platform for dialogue and cooperation, where leaders of thought and decision-makers from around the world come together to exchange ideas and explore innovative strategies to face environmental crises and climate problems.' The report 'Closing the Climate Work Gap' launched by the World Economic Forum highlights how private sector climate action in the Middle East and North Africa can lead to a fundamental transformation in the region, by highlighting how the economy can benefit from private sector investments in renewable energy and green technology. This type of work not only promotes economic growth but also has a positive impact on the labor market, by creating high-quality job opportunities, which helps to reduce unemployment rates and improve living standards.

**Earth’s Land and Trees Absorbed Almost No Net Carbon in 2023**
A preliminary report shows that Earth's land-based carbon sinks, including forests, wetlands, and soil, absorbed almost no net carbon in 2023, the hottest year on record. This collapse of terrestrial carbon sinks is a concern, as it means the world's land-based ecosystems are losing their ability to regulate the planet's temperature and mitigate climate change. Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, stated, 'Nature has so far balanced our abuse. This is coming to an end.' The collapse of terrestrial carbon sinks is provisional and may be due to excessive drought and wildfires caused by global heating. Without the planet's carbon sinks performing at a normal rate, reaching net zero will not be possible. Researchers say that carbon flow through the ocean and land is still a mystery, and climate models may be too optimistic due to missing factors such as drought-induced tree mortality. The planet's ability to absorb carbon weakening even moderately would make much steeper reductions in greenhouse gas emissions necessary to get to net zero.

**Opinion: New survey of IPCC authors reveals doubt, and hope, that world will achieve climate targets**
A recent study of 211 IPCC authors found that most believe the world will likely exceed the 1.5 C and 'well-below 2 C' warming targets agreed upon by the international community. The median estimate was 2.7 C by 2100, which could be a catastrophic outcome for humanity. However, not all authors think alike, with some believing that staying below 2 C is still likely, while others believe we are on track for even more horrendous levels of climate warming at above 3 C. The study also found that IPCC authors tend to overestimate the extent to which their peers share similar beliefs, a phenomenon known as the 'false-consensus effect.' This could be problematic if an author confidently believes that their expectations are widely shared by their peers. The study reaffirms the message that current efforts to tackle climate change are insufficient and more progress is needed quickly.

**WTO Expects Gradual Recovery of Global Trade in 2024 and 2025**
The World Trade Organization (WTO) expects a gradual recovery of global trade in 2024 and 2025, with a revised forecast of 2.7% growth in 2024, up from 2.6% in April. The organization has lowered its forecast for 2025 from 3.3% to 3.0%. WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala stated, 'We expect a gradual recovery of global trade in 2024, but we remain vigilant for possible disruptions, especially regional conflicts such as those in the Middle East.' The trade of goods worldwide fell 1.1% in 2023, hindered by high inflation and rising interest rates. The WTO's updated forecast for global trade in 2024 is slightly above the 2.6% predicted in April, with demand for goods higher than expected in Asia and lower than expected in Europe. The organization also expects the normalization of inflation and interest rates to boost international trade. 'As the inflationary impact recedes, we should expect to see a recovery in income and consumption of all types of goods, including imports,' said Coleman Nee, WTO economist.

**Humanity Faces a Brutal Future as Scientists Warn of 2.7°C Warming**
The 2024 State of the Climate report warns that the world is on track for 2.7°C of warming, nearly double the Paris Agreement goal of 1.5°C. Despite governments' emissions goals, the world may hit this level of warming due to continued fossil fuel emissions. The report tracks 35 of the Earth's vital signs, with 25 at record levels, all trending in the wrong directions. Climate change is already having a significant impact, and without drastic policy changes, it will continue to worsen, bringing more frequent and extreme weather. The report calls for an immediate and comprehensive end to the routine use of fossil fuels, a global carbon price, and effective policies to slash methane emissions. It also stresses the need for climate justice, with wealthier nations providing financial and technical support to less wealthy nations to help them adapt to climate change. Without drastic changes, the world is on track for catastrophic tipping points, and immediate, transformative policy changes are necessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change.

**2024 Climate Report: Perilous Times on Planet Earth**
A recent report on climate change warns that 'the future of humanity is at stake.' The report, published in the scientific journal BioScience, highlights that 25 of the 35 'vital signs' of the planet, such as CO2 concentrations, ocean temperatures, and population size, have reached record levels in 2023. The scientists warn that the climate situation is critical and worsening, with extreme weather events, heatwaves, and environmental degradation intensifying. The report notes that the world could be entering an unpredictable phase of climate and social collapse. The impact of global warming is evident, with the Earth's surface and oceans warming at alarming rates, surpassing historical averages. In 2023, the North Atlantic Ocean temperature reached a record high, causing significant disruptions to marine ecosystems. The report also identifies 28 climate feedback loops, including the melting of permafrost, which releases large amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The authors warn that the world is on track for a 2.7°C temperature increase by 2100, exceeding the Paris Agreement goals and putting the planet in a very dangerous situation. They call for a radical transformation of society, including the immediate reduction of fossil fuel use, adoption of renewable energy, and large-scale reforestation. The report concludes that 'the future of humanity is at stake' and that only decisive and urgent action can limit global warming and avoid the worst scenarios.

**The New Normal: A Permanent State of Pandemic**
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that the world is in a permanent state of pandemic. The new normal is that we need to adapt to this reality. The main reason for this is our unnatural relationship with nature. The virus originated from bats sold in Chinese markets, which are a result of humans taking animals out of their natural habitat and putting them in unnatural conditions. This is not only the case with COVID-19, but also with other diseases that are transmitted from animals to humans. According to experts, the destruction of natural ecosystems, deforestation, and the uncontrolled trade of wild animals increase the risk of transmission of diseases from animals to humans. Furthermore, the risk of animals carrying infectious diseases is twice as high when they are taken out of their natural habitat. Many scientific reports show that the number of diseases transmitted from animals to humans is increasing at an alarming rate. If we continue to disrupt the balance of nature, we will face more pandemics in the future. The solution is to restore our ecosystem and make our relationship with nature more natural. This can be achieved by using renewable energy, reducing waste, and changing our economic growth model to one that prioritizes the well-being of the planet. As the last generation that can still prevent the destruction of the planet, we must take action now. As the world has shown us through the pandemic, we are not separate from nature, but a part of it. We must reset our relationship with nature immediately.

**Climate Change: 70% of the World's Population at Risk in the Next 20 Years**
A recent study by the CICERO (Centro per la Ricerca Internazionale sul Clima) and the University of Reading warns that 70% of the world's population may be at risk of extreme events in the next 20 years if greenhouse gas emissions are not drastically reduced. The study, published in Nature Geoscience, suggests that the combination of global warming and normal climate variability can lead to rapid changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. The greatest risks are concentrated in tropical and subtropical regions, where 5 billion people live. According to the study, if emissions are not reduced to meet the Paris Agreement goals, but rather limited to 'pannicelli caldi' (mild warming), the risk could affect 70% of the population. As a technical expert, I believe that a certain level of attention and concern is necessary, without ideological dogmatism. The fact that the climate is changing abnormally is evident, and only those who deny it or believe the Earth is flat can claim that we are experiencing normal temperatures. For example, the world has seen a record production of renewable energy in the first six months of 2024, while oil consumption has exceeded 100 million barrels per day for the first time. The reasons are many, including the refusal of developing countries to limit their progress to meet the needs of developed countries, which are responsible for these problems. Therefore, the development of renewable energy alone is not enough to achieve the energy transition and decarbonization of our cities. We need economic resources, an industrial plan for the Italian supply chain, research in the field of nuclear energy, technological development in energy plants, and the implementation of the European Directive 'case Green'. The latter is a strategic aspect, as the three parties in the Meloni government voted against the Directive. The President of the Council has attacked the energy bonuses, but has not presented a concrete policy on energy efficiency.

**People Are Sharing The Things In 2024 That We Normalize As A Society But Might Not Fully Agree With**
A Reddit thread discussed things that society has normalized but people may not agree with. Some examples include the expectation of being 'on call' due to cellphones, the romanticization of hustle culture, the trend of ghosting, and the normalization of children using beauty products. Others mentioned the over-reliance on subscription services, the effects of smartphones, and the idea that one needs multiple streams of income to achieve financial freedom. Some users also expressed disagreement with the normalization of children being given phones/tablets to keep them occupied, the idea that buying a house is achievable with 'adjusting one's budget,' and the trend of having children with people one is not married to. The thread encourages users to share their own thoughts on normalized but disagreeable things in society.

**Will November 13, 2026, be the End of the World?**
A recent study claims that the world will end on November 13, 2026, due to a global crisis caused by overpopulation, leading to a collapse of social and economic systems. The study, which was conducted in 1960, suggests that the world's population will reach a point where it will no longer be able to sustain itself, resulting in a scarcity of food and energy. According to the United Nations, the world's population currently stands at over 8.2 billion people and is expected to continue growing. However, the study's findings have been questioned due to the rapid advancements in technology and changes in societal dynamics since the study was conducted. As a result, the study's predictions may not accurately reflect the current situation. The study serves as a reminder of the warnings that scientists have issued about the impact of overpopulation and sustainability on the future of humanity.

**Climate change threatening well-being of planet**
A new report by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has warned that climate change and hazardous weather are reversing development gains and threatening the well-being of people and the planet. The report states that record levels of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere will fuel global temperature increases, with a two-thirds likelihood of global warming of 3C this century. However, the report highlights significant grounds for hope, citing advances in artificial intelligence, computer learning, and other technologies that are enhancing human understanding of the Earth system. WMO Secretary-General Celest Saulo has called for urgent and ambitious action to reduce the risk of climate disasters and support sustainable development, saying, 'The decisions we make today could be the difference between a future breakdown or a breakthrough to a better world.' The report also notes that human-caused climate change has resulted in widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere. In 2023, greenhouse gas emissions were projected to grow by 16%, but the actual increase is now expected to be just 3%. The report emphasizes the need for significant reductions in emissions to limit global warming to 1.5C, with a 42% reduction needed by 2030. The report highlights numerous extreme weather events in 2023 and the first half of 2024, including heat waves, floods, and droughts, which have had devastating impacts on local communities.

**Expert Predicts the End of the World in 2026**
A 1960 study titled 'Doomsday: Friday 13 November, A.D 2026' by Heinz von Foerster, Patricia Mora, and Lawrence Amiot predicts that the world will end on November 13, 2026. The study suggests that the uncontrolled growth of the population will lead to a catastrophic collapse of the systems that sustain human life on Earth. According to the study, even if the issue of food scarcity is resolved, the population growth will be so large that it will lead to a planetary crisis, including the depletion of natural resources, collapse of social and environmental systems, and increased interaction with climate change. However, some scientists do not give much importance to this prediction, as the population growth has been reduced and controlled. The UN estimates that the world population will reach 11.2 billion by 2100, which is much lower than the predicted number.

**The End of the World: A 1960 Prediction of Human Collapse**
In 1960, a group of scientists led by Heinz von Foerster, a physicist from Harvard, predicted that the collapse of humanity, or 'end of the world', would occur in approximately 2 years, not due to natural disasters or pandemics, but due to a phenomenon closer to our reality. According to a study published in the prestigious Science journal, if the world's population continued to grow at the rate it was at the time, humanity would reach an unsustainable point in 2026, with November 13th of that year as the deadline. The study, titled 'Doomsday: Friday, 13 November, A.D. 2026', surprised the scientific community and sparked intense debate. The team of scientists used a mathematical model that demonstrated that the world's population was growing exponentially. This projection was made 6 decades ago and emphasized that the Earth would not have the necessary resources to continue supporting life by that date. Von Foerster argued that the world's population was increasing at such a rapid rate that it would reach a 'critical point' by 2026, where the growth would approach infinity, leading to the collapse of social and environmental systems. Even if humanity managed to maintain a stable food supply and avoid natural disasters, the overpopulation alone would be enough to cause a total collapse. The study warned that the true problem would be the inability of human systems to manage a growing population, rather than focusing on factors like climate change, which is now one of the biggest fears for humanity's future. After 60 years, the scenario presented by Heinz von Foerster and his team faces a series of criticisms and skepticism. While many argue that population growth rates have begun to stabilize in recent decades due to education, access to birth control, and changes in life expectancy, the debate about the limits of human growth remains relevant. The Earth's capacity to support humanity is not infinite, and problems like water scarcity, deforestation, and climate change continue to threaten the future of our planet. Although von Foerster's prediction about the end of the world in 2026 due to overpopulation has been questioned and reevaluated over time, his warning about the limits of human growth remains a valid concern.

**Heinz von Foerster's Prediction: The World Will End in 2026 Due to Human Overpopulation**
Physicist Heinz von Foerster and his team, including Patricia Mora and Lawrence Amiot, predicted that the world will end on November 13, 2026, due to human overpopulation. According to Foerster, the world's population will grow exponentially, causing a catastrophic collapse of human society and the environment. Foerster's team developed a mathematical model to determine the exact date of the world's end, which they published in the 1960 article 'Doomsday: Friday, 13 November, A.D. 2026' in the Science journal. They stated that human overpopulation will lead to the depletion of natural resources, despite efforts to maintain a stable food supply. As a result, the collapse of social and environmental systems will occur, making it impossible for technological advancements to prevent the devastation of the world. Foerster ruled out pandemics, natural disasters, and other apocalyptic events as the cause of the world's end, emphasizing that human overpopulation is the primary factor.

**The End of the World: A Harvard Study Predicts a Catastrophic Future**
According to experts from Harvard, the end of the world is estimated to be just a few years away, specifically on November 13, 2026. The reason for this prediction is not due to an asteroid or climate change, but rather the overpopulation of the world. The study, led by physicist Heinz von Foerster, estimates that the world's population will reach a critical point, leading to a collapse of the social and environmental systems. This could result in a global economic crisis and the end of life as we know it. The United Nations reports that the world's population reached 8.2 billion in 2024 and is expected to continue growing, reaching a maximum of 10.3 billion by the mid-2080s. The study highlights the challenges of early pregnancies, particularly in low-income countries, with 4.7 million babies born to mothers under the age of 18 in 2024. As Patricia Mora, a specialist from Harvard, said, 'It is a matter of managing resources, otherwise, it could be a Mad Max scenario.'

**The Imminent Date of the End of the World, According to a Harvard Expert**
A 1960 study published in Science by Heinz von Foerster, Patricia Mora, and Lawrence Amiot predicted the collapse of humanity on November 13, 2026, due to overpopulation. According to their calculations, the exponential growth of the population would lead to an unsustainable pressure on resources, causing social and environmental collapse, despite maintaining food supplies and stability. However, over 60 years later, the predictions are viewed with skepticism, as population growth rates have begun to stabilize in many parts of the world. Despite this, the study remains relevant, as the debate on the limits of human growth continues to be a central theme in the scientific community. Experts warn about the urgent need to manage resources and mitigate the environmental impact of a growing population. As Heinz von Foerster's warnings highlight, the true question is whether humanity will be able to change its course of action to ensure the survival of future generations. 'The time is running out, and the decisions we make today will be crucial for the destiny of humanity and the planet,' as the article states.
