The European Central Bank had previously set the reference rate at $1.0533 (Wednesday: $1.0629). The dollar was worth 0.9493 (0.9408) euros. Market nervousness remains high, with the dollar gaining significant momentum after Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election on November 5. Trump's campaign promises of tax cuts and higher import tariffs could increase inflation and make the US Federal Reserve more cautious in future interest rate cuts.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 07:53 PM\nSource:[ad-hoc-news.de](https://www.ad-hoc-news.de/boerse/news/ueberblick/der-kurs-des-euro-eu0009652759-hat-sich-am-donnerstag-im-spaeten-new/66111478)\n\n**Euro Falls Below $1.05 Amid Trump's Presidential Win**\nThe euro has fallen below $1.05 and is at its lowest level since October 2023, depreciating 4% against the US dollar since Donald Trump's presidential election win on November 5. According to analysts at Ebury, the rise in the dollar is due to investors anticipating a rise in US tariffs, elevated geopolitical risks, and increased global uncertainty under Trump's presidency. Experts at Renta4 note that the dollar's appreciation is intensified by Trump's confirmation as president, giving him two years to implement his policies without opposition, as the 'Republican wave' has also taken control of the US House of Representatives.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 12:08 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Español](https://es.investing.com/news/forex-news/el-euro-cae-por-debajo-de-105-dolares-y-se-situa-en-minimos-desde-octubre-de-2023-2913857)\n\n**Dollar climbs to one-year peak; Powell's speech in focus By Investing.com**\nThe US dollar has reached a one-year high, trading at 106.807, after consumer inflation data raised doubts over the extent of Fed interest rate cuts. Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election and his likely policies of lower taxes and trade tariffs have added to the uncertainty over likely Fed rate decisions. Analysts at ING said, 'We think this week's price action has given us a taste of what's to come in FX markets in this second Trump term, with brief dollar corrections taken as an opportunity to enter structural USD longs at more attractive levels.' The dollar's rise has been driven by the uncertainty over likely Fed rate decisions and Trump's policies, which are seen as inflationary. The euro, on the other hand, has struggled due to the political uncertainty in Germany and the potential for tariffs against Europe from the new Trump administration. The single currency is also facing challenges due to the German economy's fragility, with the German Council of Economic Experts cutting its growth forecasts for Europe's biggest economy for 2024 and 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 09:47 AM\nSource:[Investing.com UK](https://uk.investing.com/news/forex-news/dollar-climbs-to-oneyear-peak-powells-speech-in-focus-3790936)\n\n**Why is the euro falling and could it hit $1? By Reuters**\nThe euro has fallen to one-year lows, sparking concerns it could hit the $1 mark. Donald Trump's U.S. election win has raised the prospect of a hike in tariffs that could deal a fresh blow to the euro zone economy. According to JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank, a drop to parity could happen, depending on the extent of tariffs. A weak currency typically raises the cost of imports, leading to higher prices for food, energy, and raw materials. However, most economists see inflation back at its 2% target next year after some volatility at the end of 2024. A fall in the euro makes exports cheaper, which is good news for Europe's automakers, industrials, and luxury retailers. Benjamin Melman, CIO of Edmond de Rothschild, said, 'Everyone is gloomy on Europe and we understand the gloominess but we could have some positive surprises.' The ECB is in a better position than the last time the euro weakened sharply, with inflation trending lower and a relatively small pass-through from currency moves to inflation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 02:27 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/why-is-the-euro-falling-and-could-it-hit-1-3720234)\n\n**Euro Could Fall to 1.0 Against US Dollar by 2025, Capital Economics Predicts**\nCapital Economics predicts that the Euro could fall to 1.0 against the US dollar by the end of 2025. Economist James Reilly believes that US President-elect Donald Trump's potential introduction of tariffs next year could reduce demand for Euro region exports to the US. Reilly also notes that tariffs could shift the US-Eurozone yield gap in favor of the dollar. Reilly expects the Fed to respond to the inflationary effects of tariffs by lowering interest rates more slowly and less than previously expected, while the ECB is likely to lower interest rates more than expected due to the economic impact of slowing exports.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 01:08 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Türkiye](https://tr.investing.com/news/world-news/capital-economics-euro-abd-dolar-karssnda-2025-sonuna-kadar-10a-gerileyebilir-3138407)\n\n**Dollar Gains Value as Euro Falls Below 1.08 Dollar**\nThe US dollar has gained significantly in value overnight, with the euro falling below the 1.08 dollar mark.

Sirotkin believes that the ruble will likely weaken by the end of the year due to high inflation factors. He also stated that the situation with the ruble's exchange rate will not improve significantly in 2025.

Sirotkin stated, 'If the dollar stabilizes at around 92-93 rubles by the end of 2024, the euro at around 100 rubles, and the yuan at 11.50-12 rubles, that would be a good sign. However, it seems unlikely that these levels will be reached, as there are many inflationary factors that will likely cause the ruble to weaken by the end of the year.' Sirotkin also noted that the situation with the ruble's exchange rate in 2025 will not improve significantly. He stated that the Russian government has announced the budget structure for 2025, which allows for high inflation, and therefore, he does not expect any positive trends in the ruble's exchange rate by the end of the year or in the following year.

The euro was down 0.06 per cent at US$1.10931, while the dollar was up 0.3 per cent on the Japanese yen at 149.02. Lee Hardman, senior currency analyst at MUFG, said, 'The data yesterday from the US has taken some of the upward momentum out of the dollar, though in terms of the impact on Fed policy making, we think it’s pretty limited.' Britain's economy grew in August, but the pound was broadly steady on the dollar and little changed on the euro. Traders are watching French politics, after the government delivered its 2025 budget with plans for US$65.5 billion worth of spending cuts and tax hikes. The budget is unlikely to pass until December, and ratings agency Fitch is scheduled to update its view on France's debt late on Friday, which could trigger a short-term reaction. Markets are also awaiting a news conference from China's finance ministry on fiscal policy on Saturday. The Australian dollar was last down 0.1 per cent on the day at US$0.6734, and set for a weekly fall of 0.9 per cent. The New Zealand dollar was at US$0.6092, set for a weekly fall of more than 1 per cent, due to the central bank slashing rates by a half point and hinting at further cuts to come.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2024 09:38 PM\nSource:[businesstimes.com.sg](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/banking-finance/dollar-pauses-breath-after-us-data-eyes-french-and-british-economies)\n\n**Exchange Rate Fluctuations: Implications for the Global Economy**\nThe exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro has significant implications for the global economy, as both currencies are widely used in international transactions. Monitoring this exchange rate is crucial for minimizing risks and maximizing benefits in a globalized environment. According to the latest data, 1 US dollar is equivalent to 0.91025 euros, while 1 euro requires 1.09855 US dollars to purchase. These fluctuations in the exchange rate are indicative of how economic changes, Federal Reserve and European Central Bank policies, and geopolitical and socio-economic events affect currency valuations. Staying up-to-date with the exchange rate is essential for global economic agents, facilitating informed and appropriate decision-making in a complex economic landscape. This adjustment reflects the impacts of various challenges, such as declining purchasing power and decreasing external demand. Despite these challenges, a gradual recovery is anticipated, driven by improvements in inflation conditions and a stable labor market. Additionally, a slowdown in inflation is expected, contrasting with previous high expectations. The EU's annual inflation rate is estimated to fall to 3.0% in 2024 and 2.5% in 2025, with a similar trend in the eurozone. This change is largely due to a decline in energy prices and a relaxation of price pressures on goods and services. This trend represents a relief for the economy, paving the way for a gradual stabilization of prices. However, the economic landscape is marked by notable uncertainty, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and potential impacts of commercial disruptions. Factors such as climate risks and increased incidence of extreme weather events also contribute to this uncertainty, presenting additional challenges for the EU and eurozone economies, affecting potential growth and inflation projections, and complicating medium-term economic recovery prospects.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 05:17 AM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/espana/2024/10/08/tipo-de-cambio-precio-del-euro-frente-al-dolar-hoy-8-de-octubre/)\n\n**Euro Celebrates 25 Years: A Resilient Currency in a Turbulent Global Economy**\nThe recent exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro has placed the dollar at 0.90405 euros and the euro at 1.10615 dollars.

The European Commission's recent review of economic forecasts for 2024 indicates a slowdown in the economic recovery of the European Union and the eurozone, adjusting growth rates to lower levels than previously anticipated. For 2023, a growth rate of 0.5% is expected, with a slight improvement in 2024 but still below previous expectations. This slowdown is influenced by several adverse factors, including reductions in purchasing power and weaker external demand, although a gradual recovery is expected, supported by declining inflation and a favorable labor market.

According to recent data, 1 US dollar is equivalent to 0.89955 euros, while 1 euro requires 1.11165 US dollars. These fluctuations in the exchange rate are indicative of how economic changes, policies from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, and geopolitical and socio-economic events impact currency valuation. Staying up-to-date with exchange rates is essential for global economic agents, facilitating informed decision-making in a complex economic landscape. Economic forecasts for 2024 indicate a slowdown in the European Union's economic recovery and the eurozone, adjusting growth rate expectations to lower levels than previously anticipated. The European Commission's recent review of economic forecasts for 2024 suggests a 0.5% growth rate for 2023, with a slight improvement in 2024 but still below previous expectations. This slowdown is influenced by several adverse factors, including reduced purchasing power and weaker external demand, although a gradual recovery is expected, supported by declining inflation and a favorable labor market. Inflation projections point to a more rapid decline than estimated, with a downward trend expected to continue until reaching more sustainable levels by 2025. This decrease is primarily due to falling energy prices and reduced pressure on consumer prices, suggesting a path towards economic stabilization. However, the economic context is affected by significant uncertainty due to external factors, such as ongoing geopolitical tensions and potential effects of trade disruptions, as well as climate change and extreme weather events. These factors could influence the projected growth and inflation trajectories, adding an element of risk to expectations of economic recovery in the EU and eurozone in the short to medium term. The euro has proven to be a robust currency, maintaining its position as the second most important currency in the international monetary system, 25 years after its launch. According to Consilium Europa, the euro constitutes 20.5% of official foreign exchange reserves worldwide, compared to 58.4% for the US dollar.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 05:15 AM\nSource:[Infobae](https://www.infobae.com/espana/2024/09/24/cambio-de-euro-a-dolar-hoy-24-de-septiembre-como-esta-la-cotizacion-y-previsiones)\n\n**US Dollar vs Euro Exchange Rate: A Crucial Measure of Economic Stability**\nThe exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro plays a crucial role in serving as a measure between the economy and stability between Europe and the United States. This exchange rate can affect international trade transactions, determining purchasing power and competitiveness. Its follow-up is vital for investors, multinational companies, and economic authorities, but also for those who want to make transactions at exchange offices for everyday situations such as a trip abroad. In the last session, the foreign exchange market presented movements in both currencies: the US dollar and the euro. According to the latest data, 1 US dollar is equivalent to 0.89580 euros, while to acquire 1 euro, 1.11635 US dollars are needed. This exchange rate reflects how economic fluctuations, monetary policies adopted by the Federal Reserve of the United States and the European Central Bank, as well as geopolitical and socio-economic events, can influence the valuation of currencies. A deep and updated knowledge of the exchange rate is essential for those participating in the global economy, allowing for more informed and timely decisions in an economically constantly evolving environment. The European economy and the euro zone experienced a weaker start than expected in 2024, adjusting growth expectations to 0.5% for 2023 and projecting a moderate increase for the following years, with 0.9% in the EU and 0.8% in the euro zone in 2024, before reaching a more robust growth in 2025. This adjustment reflects the impacts of various challenges, such as the weakening of purchasing power and a decreasing external demand. Despite these challenges, a gradual recovery is anticipated, driven by improvements in inflation conditions and a stable labor market. On the other hand, a predictable deceleration of inflation is observed, contrasting with higher forecasts from last autumn. The annual inflation rate in the EU is estimated to fall to 3.0% in 2024 and 2.5% in 2025, with a similar trend in the euro zone. This change is largely due to the decline in energy prices and a relaxation in price pressures on goods and services. This trend represents a relief for the economy, opening the way to a gradual stabilization of prices. Finally, the economic landscape is marked by notable uncertainty, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and potential impacts of commercial disruptions. Factors such as climate risks and an increased incidence of extreme weather events also contribute to this uncertainty. These elements present additional challenges for the EU economy and the euro zone, potentially affecting growth and inflation projections and complicating medium-term economic recovery prospects. The euro has demonstrated notable resilience against marked economic instability worldwide. A quarter of a century after its launch, it is the second most influential currency after the US dollar. According to Consilium Europa, the euro is the currency that some countries have chosen to make loans and reserves in central banks worldwide, representing 20.5% of global foreign exchange reserves in 2022, according to constant exchange rates, compared to 58.4% of the US dollar. \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 05:15 AM\nSource:[Infobae](https://www.infobae.com/espana/2024/09/23/actualizacion-del-tipo-de-cambio-dolar-euro-hoy-23-de-septiembre)\n\n**Euro and Dollar Exchange Rates for September 20, 2024**\nThe euro blue today, Friday, September 20, 2024, is trading at $1349.88 for purchase and $1383.34 for sale.

Monitoring this exchange rate is crucial for minimizing risks and maximizing benefits in a globalized environment. According to the European Commission, the EU and eurozone economies have started 2024 with slower growth than expected, revising down growth forecasts to 0.5% and 0.9% respectively for 2023, and 0.8% for 2024 in the eurozone. However, a recovery is expected for 2025, with growth forecasts of 1.7% in the EU and 1.5% in the eurozone. Factors such as declining household purchasing power and falling external demand have contributed to the slowdown, but a rebound is anticipated driven by lower inflation, real wage growth, and a resilient labor market. Inflation is also showing signs of deceleration, with predictions indicating a significant decrease from 6.3% in 2023 to 3.0% in 2024 and 2.5% in 2025 in the EU, and a similar trend in the eurozone. This decline in inflation is attributed mainly to the reduction in energy prices and a general decrease in price pressures. However, these economic projections face uncertainties, particularly due to prolonged geopolitical tensions and the risks associated with rising transportation costs and potential new bottlenecks in supply. These factors, along with climate-related risks and the possibility of extreme weather events, could influence economic growth and inflation, adding to the uncertainty in current predictions. As the euro celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2024, it remains a symbol of the freedom that the European Union provides to its citizens, reflecting the path towards greater economic unification and stability in Europe, despite the challenges it has faced, such as the pandemic and Brexit. The euro has also maintained its position as the second most important currency, after the US dollar, and is preferred by several countries for use in their central banks' reserves.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 17, 2024 05:20 AM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/espana/2024/09/17/tipo-de-cambio-dolar-euro-y-proyecciones-de-este-17-de-septiembre/)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The Global South has long called for comprehensive reforms to make the Security Council more inclusive and equitable. However, countries in the Global South have differing views on the nature of the reforms needed. The G4 nations (Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan) propose expanding both permanent and non-permanent seats, while the African Union demands two permanent seats with veto power. The L.69 Group supports expanding both permanent and non-permanent membership, and the Uniting for Consensus group opposes the expansion of permanent membership. The P5, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China, have strategic reasons for maintaining the status quo and are reluctant to dilute their privileged positions.

Today, the world is likely multipolar, fragmented, and at times chaotic. This is the current state of global affairs that the UN leaders will address over the next three days. As Obama once envisioned, 'the world is a complex and ever-changing place, and we must be prepared to adapt and evolve in order to achieve our goals.'

The summit will take place on the sidelines of the 79th session of the United Nations on September 22-23, 2024. The summit aims to address current and future challenges, particularly in light of the emergence of the BRICS bloc, which will hold its meetings in Kazan, Russia from October 22-24, 2024. The summit will focus on five main tracks: sustainable development and finance, peace and security, digital future for all, youth and future generations, and global governance. The outcome of the summit will be a final version of the Future Charter, a digital global charter, and a declaration on future generations. The charter will be adopted by all member states during the summit. The Future Charter will be a living document, a dynamic framework that adapts to the requirements of the 21st century, and aligns with the basic principles of the United Nations established in 1945. After the summit, the focus will shift to implementing the recommendations and commitments made in the Future Charter. In November 2024, Azerbaijan will host the United Nations Climate Conference (COP29), and climate financing will be a top priority. In December 2024, the United Nations Conference on Non-Coastal Developing Countries will take place in Botswana, where solutions for sustainable development will be sought. In June 2025, the International Conference on Development Financing will take place in Spain, where efforts will be intensified to reform the international financial architecture, including institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. On the other hand, the BRICS bloc will hold its meetings in October 2024 in Kazan, Russia, where Russia will chair the bloc in 2024. The BRICS bloc has expanded its membership in an effort to compete with the Western-dominated global system, inviting Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, Argentina, and the UAE to join. Four countries have already joined the bloc: Egypt, Iran, the UAE, and Ethiopia in January 2024, while more than 40 countries have expressed interest in joining. The BRICS bloc represents more than 30% of the world's arable land and more than 40% of global production of grains, meat, and dairy products, as well as more than 40% of fish and seafood production, and more than 35% of global GDP. This has led to the emergence of a new world order, and a return to the bipolar system, which offers opportunities for emerging countries to choose and balance between the two blocs, requiring flexible skills, policies, and strategies from emerging countries.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 17, 2024 02:05 AM\nSource:[ElWatan News\\جريدة الوطن](https://www.elwatannews.com/news/details/7559271)\n\n**Media Advisory | 2024 E-Government Survey reveals digital government ranking of UN Member States - United Nations Sustainable Development**\nThe 2024 E-Government Survey, published by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, will be released on September 17, 2024, and will explore key trends and innovations in digital government among the 193 UN Member States.

'I think 2025 will be the year when agent systems finally go mainstream,' he explains. The main concern is how to make these tools profitable after significant investments in AI.

According to sources familiar with the situation, the agent will be able to write emails, create code, book tickets, and more. The company aims to create a computer AI agent for developers by January 2025, initially as a research prototype. OpenAI is working on several research projects related to agents, with the next milestone being a universal prototype that can perform tasks in a web browser. The company's competitors have already released similar agents that can interact with information on a user's computer in real-time. OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman has hinted that the company will release more advanced models, and that agents will be the next major breakthrough. Kevin Weil, director of products, believes that agent systems will become mainstream in 2025. The development of AI agents is a response to the decreased return on investment from OpenAI's existing AI products, which have required significant time, effort, and resources.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 02:27 PM\nSource:[Почта@Mail.ru](https://hi-tech.mail.ru/news/117717-openai-gotovit-ii-dlya-upravleniya-kompyuterom-bez-cheloveka/)\n\n**AI News: Sam Altman OpenAI To Launch Operator, Task-Automating AI Tool**\nOpenAI, led by Sam Altman, is set to launch Operator, a task-automating AI tool, in January 2025.

This move reflects a broader push in the tech sector to enable AI to execute tasks directly on user devices. OpenAI has also expanded its capabilities with ChatGPT Search, which integrates real-time web search into its ChatGPT platform, and introduced SimpleQA, an open-source factuality benchmark to enhance accuracy. However, these developments come amid growing concerns about AI safety within the industry, with OpenAI's Vice President of Research and Safety, Lilian Weng, announcing her resignation after seven years with the company. 'OpenAI is intensifying its commercial focus,' said Weng, reflecting ongoing concerns over the company's evolving priorities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 12:40 AM\nSource:[Coingape](https://coingape.com/ai-news-sam-altman-openai-to-launch-operator-task-automating-ai-tool/)\n\n**OpenAI's Next-Generation Model Faces Performance Ceiling**\nOpenAI's next-generation model, Orion, is expected to show a moderate improvement over GPT-4, according to The Information, which has cited anonymous sources within the company. This has sparked debate about the viability of developing increasingly advanced AI models and the laws of scaling, which are theoretical rules about how these models improve. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated that 'the laws of scaling are decided by God; the constants, by the technical team.' However, some of his own employees have expressed doubts about these laws, citing the growing evidence that leading AI models are hitting a performance ceiling. The company has resorted to using additional methods to improve performance, such as incorporating human feedback into the training process. Gary Marcus, a professor at NYU and AI critic, has stated that the development of AI is destined to hit a wall, and that recent models, including OpenAI's Orion, show signs of producing smaller performance gains than their predecessors. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of OpenAI, has also suggested that the results of model scaling have plateaued, and that 'scaling the right things is now more important than ever.' The industry will continue to seek ways to provoke large performance gains, with some experts predicting that the next generation of models will be more expensive to train, with some estimates reaching $100 billion.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 06:15 AM\nSource:[businessinsider.es](https://www.businessinsider.es/tecnologia/openai-apuros-mejorar-proximo-modelo-inteligencia-artificial-1418295)\n\n**OpenAI Discusses Corporate Structure Transformation with Regulators**\nOpenAI is in early-stage negotiations with the California Attorney General's office regarding a potential transformation of its corporate structure into a commercial business, according to Bloomberg sources. The process may involve regulatory review of how the AI startup evaluates intellectual property, the agency notes. The Delaware Attorney General has also discussed the matter with the company. OpenAI declined to comment, emphasizing that the non-profit organization will continue to exist under any restructuring. 'We continue to consult with independent financial and legal advisors. Any potential restructuring will allow the non-profit organization to continue to exist and thrive, and also receive full value for its current share in the commercial company OpenAI and expand its possibilities for fulfilling its mission,' said OpenAI's non-profit board chair Bret Taylor. OpenAI first announced its intention to change its governance structure to a commercial business in June. This would allow the company to generate profits while pursuing its original goal of promoting public benefit. In October, OpenAI raised $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion, with the high valuation dependent on its ability to change its corporate structure and remove profit restrictions for investors. The decision requires approval from the non-profit board, which includes Sam Altman and eight others. It's worth noting that in August, Elon Musk resumed a lawsuit against OpenAI, accusing the company of prioritizing commercial interests over public benefit.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 09:58 AM\nSource:[forklog.com](https://forklog.com/news/ai/smi-openai-obsudila-s-regulyatorami-preobrazovanie-korporativnoj-struktury)\n\n**Openai's Nonprofit Shift to For-Profit Structure Draws Scrutiny Over ChatGPT Valuation**\nOpenAI, a $157 billion AI company backed by Microsoft, is in talks with California and Delaware's attorney generals to change its nonprofit structure to a for-profit model.

Jan Leike, a prominent researcher, left after claiming that 'safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.' The dissolution of Brundage's 'AGI Readiness' team highlights mounting tensions between OpenAI's original mission and its commercial ambitions. The company faces pressure to transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit public benefit corporation within two years, or risk returning funds from its recent $6.6 billion investment round. This shift toward commercialization has long concerned Brundage, who expressed reservations back in 2019 when OpenAI first established its for-profit division.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 07:32 PM\nSource:[The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278694/openai-agi-readiness-miles-brundage-ai-safety)\n\n**OpenAI has 2 years to transition to a for-profit company. Here are 6 key things it will need to do in that time.**\nOpenAI is transitioning to a for-profit company within the next two years, allowing it to raise billions more in funding. This shift comes after tensions between nonprofit purists and those who wanted to move more quickly to develop and release products. The company will need to take several complex steps, including asset conversion, equity distribution, and governance structure changes. Microsoft's $13 billion investment in OpenAI will give it a significant amount of equity in the new structure, which may warrant antitrust regulation. CEO Sam Altman is set to receive a 7% equity stake, valued at $150 billion, although he has dismissed reports of this as 'ludicrous.' OpenAI must also address ongoing litigation, including a lawsuit from Elon Musk, which claims that the company prioritized commercial interests over the public benefit.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2024 10:34 PM\nSource:[businessinsider.in](https://www.businessinsider.in/artificial-intelligence/news/openai-has-2-years-to-transition-to-a-for-profit-company-here-are-6-key-things-it-will-need-to-do-in-that-time-/articleshow/113796896.cms)\n\n**OpenAI reportedly plans to ditch its nonprofit mission with CEO Sam Altman said to be in line to make billions**\nOpenAI reportedly plans to abandon its nonprofit mission and adopt a for-profit model, with CEO Sam Altman set to gain significant control and equity. According to reports, the nonprofit organization will continue to exist but will only own a minority stake in the new for-profit structure. This move comes alongside several high-profile departures from OpenAI, including CTO Mira Murati and Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew. The restructuring plans and departures are reportedly correlated. As OpenAI's mission statement from 2015 states, 'OpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence research company. Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.' A shift to for-profit would be a fundamental change, requiring a website purge and potentially altering the company's values. This move is not entirely surprising, given Google's similar shift from 'Don't be evil' to a more commercial focus in 2018.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2024 01:08 PM\nSource:[PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/openai-reportedly-plans-to-ditch-its-nonprofit-mission-with-ceo-sam-altman-said-to-be-in-line-to-make-billions)\n\n**OpenAI looks to shift away from nonprofit roots and convert itself to for-profit company**\nOpenAI, the company behind the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, is considering a major restructuring that would shift its focus from a nonprofit research institute to a for-profit corporation.

However, this move has been met with criticism from Mozilla, which has accused OpenAI of prioritizing profits over its public interest mission. OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman has denied that the company's recent high-profile departures are related to the restructuring, but the move has raised questions about the company's governance structure and its commitment to its original mission.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2024 12:19 PM\nSource:[The Mercury News](https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/09/27/openai-looks-to-shift-away-from-nonprofit-roots-and-convert-itself-to-for-profit-company)\n\n**OpenAI may convert to for-profit company**\nOpenAI, the artificial intelligence company behind ChatGPT, may be converting from a nonprofit research institute to a for-profit corporation. According to a source, the company's board is considering a decision to change OpenAI's structure to a public benefit corporation, which would make it accountable to shareholders. This move would change the company's mission, as it currently has a nonprofit board of directors focused on helping humanity.

CEO Sam Altman will now have ultimate control and equity worth billions, while the nonprofit board has been stripped of its control. This move has been criticized by former employees and AI safety advocates, who argue that it is a money grab and a betrayal of OpenAI's founding principles. The company's shift to a for-profit structure has raised concerns about the potential risks and costs of AI deployment, and has validated the need for regulation and oversight. As one former employee said, 'It seems to me the original nonprofit has been disempowered and had its mission reinterpreted to be fully aligned with profit.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 26, 2024 09:01 PM\nSource:[MSN](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/openai-as-we-knew-it-is-dead/ar-AA1rh3fi)\n\n**OpenAI to Become Commercial Company, Ending Non-Profit Status**\nOpenAI, the developer of the popular generative model, will become a commercial company. The company, which was registered as a non-profit organization in 2015, will now officially focus on making a profit. This decision was prompted by a corporate conflict, which led to the departure of three top managers responsible for technology development and research. The company's restructure has been long overdue, according to Alexander Gorny, co-founder of AIAcademy: 'They initially aimed to develop technologies for the benefit of humanity, with open-source code. However, since 2022, they have become one of the most closed companies in the industry, focusing on commercial products and profit, rather than the benefit of society.' OpenAI's shift to a commercial model will make it easier for investors and allow the company to become more profitable. The company has already started to develop tools for corporate clients and has hired more staff focused on sales and finance. As Yuri Brissov, partner at Digital & Analogue Partners, notes: 'The company's non-profit status reduced its responsibility for the fate of its developments. Now, OpenAI is systematizing and starting to negotiate with publishers, promising to pay them money. To pay money, you need to receive income. The natural cycle has occurred.' The period of free access and testing is likely coming to an end, and OpenAI will focus on creating more commercial products, paid access, subscriptions, and paid integrations with businesses.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 26, 2024 04:59 PM\nSource:[Коммерсантъ](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/7183417)\n\n**OpenAI May Become a Commercial Corporation: Giving Up Non-Profit Control for Investments**\nOpenAI is working on transforming its main business into a profitable corporation, which will no longer be controlled by its non-profit board, making the company more attractive to investors, according to sources from Reuters.

'We are still focused on creating artificial intelligence that benefits everyone, and we are working with our board to ensure the best position for achieving success in our mission. The non-profit organization is the foundation of our mission and will continue to exist,' said an OpenAI spokesperson. The restructuring plan is currently being coordinated with lawyers and shareholders, and the timeline for its completion has not been determined.

According to Bloomberg, the company is considering this move to become a commercial business and attract funding. OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a non-profit organization, but it is now exploring changes amid the departure of several employees. A representative of the company stated that OpenAI remains focused on developing artificial intelligence and that the non-profit organization 'will continue to exist.' This comes after several high-profile departures, including the technical director Mira Murati, who left the company to focus on her own research, and co-founder John Schulman, who joined rival Anthropic. Co-founder Greg Brockman also took a creative leave of absence until the end of the year, and co-founder Ilya Sutskever left the company in May. Altman was previously fired in November 2023, but was reinstated as CEO in November after a new board of directors was formed. He was allowed to return to the board of directors in March after a legal review.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 26, 2024 07:34 AM\nSource:[Ведомости](https://www.vedomosti.ru/investments/news/2024/09/26/1064671-openai-v-ramkah)\n\n**OpenAI to Change Status to Commercial Corporation Amid Restructuring**\nOpenAI, a non-profit organization founded in 2015, plans to change its status to a commercial corporation, according to Bloomberg. This change comes amid significant personnel changes, including the unexpected departure of technical director Mira Murati. The company is also leaving chief scientist Bob McGrew and vice president of research Barrett Zof. Earlier this year, co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, co-founder and former lead researcher John Schulman, and former lead researcher Yan Leike left the company. Co-founder and former president Greg Brockman recently took a leave of absence until the end of the year. Currently, only three of the 13 people who founded OpenAI in December 2015 remain. OpenAI's transformation began in late 2022 with the release of ChatGPT, which became an instant hit and sparked global interest in the potential of generative AI. Under the leadership of CEO Sam Altman, the company has started releasing new products for consumers and corporate clients, as well as hiring sales, strategy, and finance experts. This has caused concern among some employees, particularly those who have been with the company since its inception, who believe that the company is prioritizing product releases over its original mission of creating safe AI systems. The restructuring of OpenAI is aimed at making it more attractive to investors. The company is currently trying to close a funding round worth up to $6.5 billion, valued at $150 billion. Negotiations are underway with companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and MGX from the UAE. Unlike previous investors, those who invest in the current round will not have restrictions on their profit. However, if the restructuring does not occur within two years, new investors will be able to demand the return of their funds, as stated by Sam Altman, 'We are committed to making OpenAI a sustainable and profitable company, but we also want to ensure that our mission and values remain intact.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 26, 2024 06:18 AM\nSource:[NEWSru.co.il](https://www.newsru.co.il/finance/26sep2024/openai304.html)\n\n**OpenAI says goodbye to non-profit status, hello to commercial focus**\nOpenAI is changing its fundamental values by no longer being a non-profit organization. The company will now be 'for-profit' and its primary goal will be to make money for its owners, rather than serving humanity and the public. According to Reuters, OpenAI is planning to restructure its core business to focus on commercial activities. This will involve a fundamental change that will free the company from the control of its original owner, OpenAI Nonprofit. Microsoft currently owns 49% of OpenAI, but has limited influence due to the control held by OpenAI Nonprofit, which owns only 2% of the company. OpenAI Nonprofit still adheres to the original mission: to serve humanity, make something good with AI, help the world, and benefit the public. With this new move, OpenAI will become more attractive to investors and have a structure similar to most other startup companies. Sam Altman will become a co-owner. According to Reuters, it is planned that OpenAI Nonprofit will still own a small share of OpenAI, but without decisive influence. It is also planned that Sam Altman, the company's famous co-founder and director, will receive an ownership stake in OpenAI for the first time. Reuters estimates that the company will be valued at around $150 billion after the restructuring. The company will not confirm the information to Reuters, which cites unnamed sources. According to Reuters, lawyers and shareholders are currently reviewing the details. It is unclear when the changes will take effect. 'We remain focused on building AI that benefits everyone, and we are working with our board to ensure we are positioned to succeed with our mission. Non-profit is essential to our mission and will continue to exist,' OpenAI said in a statement to Reuters. Three of OpenAI's top executives are leaving the company, including CTO Mira Murati and development directors Barret Zoph and Bob McGrew. Mira Murati has been with the company for nearly seven years and was briefly CEO. She writes on X that she is leaving because she 'wants to create time and space' for herself. Recently, co-founder John Schulman has also left the company to join competitor Anthropic, while co-founder Greg Brockman has announced that he will be on leave for a year. The discussion about OpenAI's future and fundamental values was also the reason for the power struggle in OpenAI in November 2023, where Sam Altman was briefly fired and then reappointed a few days later. Since then, co-founder Ilya Sutskever has also left the company.\nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: September 26, 2024 04:45 AM\nSource:[Computerworld Danmark](https://www.computerworld.dk/art/288790/slut-med-at-vaere-non-profit-for-openai-vil-aendre-fundamental-del-i-sine-vaerdier-topchefer-siger-farvel-og-tak)\n\n**OpenAI's Restructure: From Non-Profit To Potential $150B For-Profit — Sam Altman Could Get Equity**\nOpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, is reportedly transitioning from a non-profit to a for-profit benefit corporation.

An OpenAI spokesperson said, 'We remain focused on building AI that benefits everyone, and we're working with our board to ensure that we're best positioned to succeed in our mission.'

OpenAI is close to finalizing a $6.5 billion investment round, with a provision allowing investors to ask for money back if governance changes don't happen within two years. An OpenAI spokesperson said, 'We remain focused on building AI that benefits everyone and, as we've previously shared, we're working with our board to ensure that we're best positioned to succeed in our mission.

She explained her decision by saying she wants to 'free up time and space for my own research'. Murati has been with OpenAI for almost six and a half years, joining in June 2018 as a vice president responsible for working with partners. She previously worked at Leap Motion, which developed motion capture technology, and at Tesla. Murati temporarily took over as CEO of OpenAI in November 2023, after the board of directors unexpectedly fired co-founder Sam Altman as CEO. However, Altman was reinstated as CEO just a few days later. The board of directors never explained why Murati was temporarily removed as CEO. Altman has expressed his support for Murati's decision, saying 'it's hard to overstate how much Mira means to OpenAI, our mission, and all of us personally'. He also announced that Bob McGrew, the head of research, and Barrett Zof, the vice president of research, will be leaving the company. McGrew had been with OpenAI for almost eight years, while Zof had been there for just over two years. Altman said that all three had decided to leave independently of each other. OpenAI is preparing for a new funding round, which could value the company at $150 billion and raise $6.5 billion in investments. However, this would require the company to change its governance structure. OpenAI was initially created as a non-profit organization, with a mission to develop safe general artificial intelligence. In 2019, a subsidiary with 'limited commercial profit' was created, called OpenAI LP. This subsidiary is subordinate to the original non-profit organization, which is now referred to as OpenAI Nonprofit. To attract the desired investments, OpenAI must become a fully commercial organization. The decision to change the governance structure has already been made, and the company is now working with lawyers and shareholders to implement the plan. The non-profit structure will continue to exist, but will hold a minority stake in the new commercial organization. The exact timing of these changes is unclear.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 26, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[Meduza](https://meduza.io/feature/2024/09/26/proishodyaschee-v-openai-sravnivayut-s-igroy-prestolov-iz-kompanii-ushla-mira-murati-i-esche-dva-klyuchevyh-sotrudnika-sem-altman-gotovitsya-stat-bogache-na-10-milliardov-dollarov)\n\n**Sam Altman plans to upend OpenAI's nonprofit model -- as another key executive exits**\nOpenAI is planning to restructure its business into a for-profit benefit corporation, giving CEO Sam Altman equity for the first time.

According to Reuters, the restructuring will mean that the company will no longer be controlled by its non-profit board of directors. The nonprofit will continue to operate and gain a minority ownership stake in the for-profit corporation. Altman's stake valuation is unclear, but he was worth at least $2 billion as of May, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The non-profit structure was established to advance digital intelligence in a way that benefits humanity as a whole, without limiting its work to generating financial returns. However, in 2019, OpenAI Global LLC, a for-profit subsidiary with limited liability, was announced to raise capital. OpenAI promised that the non-profit organization would remain intact and its board would continue to govern all activities. However, sources suggest that this scenario may change due to the need for more funding. OpenAI is seeking new investors to fulfill its mission, but its current structure may deter some investors. The solution may be to change the structure, allowing OpenAI to free itself from the control of its non-profit organization. OpenAI's commercial arm is working on a major restructuring, which would involve giving up control of the non-profit organization. A spokesperson for OpenAI stated, 'We are focused on creating AI that benefits everyone, and we are working with our board of directors to ensure we are well-positioned to succeed in our mission. The non-profit organization is fundamental to our mission and will continue to exist.' The non-profit organization would have a minority stake in the for-profit company, which could be effective in attracting more investors, but raises concerns about the centralization of power in a leading AI company, potentially leading to security risks.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 10:59 PM\nSource:[Xataka](https://www.xataka.com/empresas-y-economia/openai-perfila-reestructuracion-audaz-librarse-control-su-organizacion-animos-lucro-reuters)\n\n**OpenAI Plans to End Nonprofit Board's Control, Reuters Says**\nOpenAI is planning to restructure its organization, according to Reuters, which would give its nonprofit board less control over the company's main business.

The non-profit will continue to exist and own a minority stake in the for-profit company. This change could have implications for how the company manages AI risks in a new governance structure.

Former CEO Sam Altman informed employees at a recent meeting that the company has 'outgrown' its non-profit agreement and is set to transition away from non-profit control.

The two betting apps outranked popular smartphone apps like ChatGPT, TikTok, and Instagram. According to data from both websites, more than $4 billion worth of bets have been placed on Polymarket, compared to over $500 million for Kalshi.

Polymarket has come under scrutiny for alleged flaws, including wash trading and a lack of transparency. In contrast, PredictIt, a platform that limits the number of users and position sizes, has shown more reliable odds, with Kamala Harris's chances exceeding Trump's for the first time in about a month.

According to the Wall Street Journal, citing high-ranking officials in the Biden administration, the final decision will be made by the new administration of Donald Trump, who won the recent presidential election. 'The US must be prepared to expand its nuclear forces to prevent growing threats from China, Russia, and North Korea,' the article states. However, the exact plans for Trump's defense policy have not been announced. One of the reasons for the US to reconsider its nuclear strategy is the active buildup of military power by China and North Korea, as well as the suspension of dialogue with Russia on arms control, including the Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive Arms. Trump's return to the White House may signal a new wave of development of the country's nuclear potential. The US nuclear arsenal consists of nuclear warheads in the country's armed forces.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 09:37 AM\nSource:[Pravda](https://www.pravda.ru/news/videochannel/2133460-usa_increase_nuclear_arsenal/)\n\n**Ukraine: Media Reports Nuclear Missile Ready Soon, But Kiev Denies 'No Plan'**\nA nuclear threat has emerged in the diplomatic skirmishes surrounding the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, just before Donald Trump's presidential mandate.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has been modernizing his nuclear forces and has rejected talks with Washington on replacing New START, the last US-Russia arms limitation pact. China is building up its strategic nuclear forces, with estimates suggesting it will have 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035. Iran may decide to build nuclear weapons following tit-for-tat strikes with Israel and the failure to revive major power talks on restoring curbs on its nuclear programme.

Trump is likely to try to force a ceasefire in Ukraine, possibly involving a permanent settlement that acknowledges Russia's territorial gains. He may also accept demands from Vladimir Putin to prevent Ukraine's NATO membership. In the Middle East, Trump is expected to double down on his support for Israel and Saudi Arabia, taking a tougher line on Iran. This could lead to a widening of the conflict in Lebanon and a potentially devastating strike against Iran. Relations with China are likely to be characterized by continuity, with Trump increasing import tariffs and potentially making pragmatic deals with Xi Jinping. However, Trump's commitment to defending Taiwan and other treaty allies in Asia is uncertain, and his unpredictability makes it possible that he would accept a nuclear-armed North Korea as part of a broader deal with Russia. This could give Trump additional leverage over China, but also strain relations between the U.S. and its allies in all three regions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 06:28 PM\nSource:[globelynews.com](https://globelynews.com/world/trump-win-us-foreign-policy/)\n\n**Trump Expresses Confidence in Election Performance**\nIn the United States, citizens went to the polls for the presidential and congressional elections, where the Republican candidate Donald Trump and the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris are competing.

If it is a fair election and I lose, I will be the first to accept it.' Trump also accused his rival Kamala Harris and her supporter Oprah Winfrey of being 'divisive.' He emphasized the importance of securing the borders, claiming that drug dealers and terrorists are entering through the border.

The warning comes after Israel's recent airstrikes against Iranian military installations, which destroyed strategic air defenses and killed five people. Iran has so far refrained from attacking Israel's essential oil and nuclear facilities, but that calculation could change, according to Israeli officials. 'A strong and complex response is being prepared,' said an Iranian official, as quoted by WSJ. 'Our military lost people, so we need to respond.' Iran may use Iraqi territory as part of the operation and could attack Israeli military installations 'in a much more aggressive way than last time,' according to officials. The response will not be limited to missiles and drones, as in previous attacks, and any missiles used could have more powerful warheads, officials said. The Iranian response is being delayed until after the US presidential elections on Tuesday, to avoid influencing the outcome, and will occur before the new president is inaugurated in January 2025. Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian has conditioned the intensity and type of the response to a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon. 'If they (the Israelis) reconsider their behavior, accept a ceasefire, and stop massacring the oppressed and innocent people of the region, it could affect the intensity and type of our response,' Pezeshkian said in a cabinet meeting, according to IRNA.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 02:14 AM\nSource:[eluniversal.com.mx](https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/mundo/iran-advierte-de-un-ataque-fuerte-y-complejo-contra-israel-adelanta-que-usaria-armas-mas-poderosas-segun-wsj/)\n\n**ANALYSIS: Trump is going to win BIG, and then the real fireworks begin… America won’t survive as we know it for even ONE YEAR**\nThe author predicts a catastrophic scenario in the United States if Donald Trump wins the election. They claim that the Democratic Party will try to cheat and rig the election, but the Fifth Circuit's decision on mail-in ballots will put a damper on their plan. Once Trump is declared the winner, the author expects the radical Left to unleash violence and chaos across America, including activating millions of military-aged males who have illegally crossed the border. The author also predicts that the USA and NATO may initiate a nuclear exchange with Russia, and that there is a strong possibility of a nuclear false flag detonation on US soil. The author believes that the Democrats will try to block Trump's certification on January 6th, 2025, and that martial law may be declared, leading to civil war. The author also predicts that the US dollar will collapse, leading to hyperinflation and food scarcity. They urge Americans to prepare for chaos and to get to a red county in a red state before the situation escalates. The author also mentions a scenario where Biden resigns before January 6th and Kamala becomes president, and that Democrats will block Trump from being certified, leading to martial law and civil war. They also mention a poll that shows almost half of Americans think a civil war is likely, and that a former CIA advisor warns that the US is headed for civil war.

The report states that China is expanding its nuclear capabilities in view of its strategic and security interests. This includes advanced systems such as missile silos, ground-mobile, submarine-launched, and nuclear-capable hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs). According to The Week, China's nuclear stockpile could double by 2030, potentially destabilizing global security. Currently, China has over 500 operational nuclear warheads, and the report suggests that most of these warheads will be capable of targeting mainland America. China's nuclear power status SIPRI's report states that as of January 2024, China had 500 nuclear warheads, up from 410 in 2023. By January this year, the total number of nuclear warheads worldwide was 12,221, with 9,585 potentially usable. Russia and the US have over 90% of the world's nuclear weapons, with China in third place. Other countries, such as Britain, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel, are also modernizing their arsenals.

The report, titled 'Nuclear Challenges: Growing Capabilities of Strategic Rivals and Regional Adversaries,' states that China is developing a new series of nuclear capabilities, including the construction of the largest nuclear missile silo. China is modernizing its nuclear arsenal for strategic ambitions and security interests, with a focus on nuclear missiles, including ground-mobile, submarine-launched, and hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs). The report estimates that China's nuclear arsenal will double by 2030, with an estimated 1,000 operational nuclear weapons, most of which will be capable of reaching mainland America. China is also developing fully new nuclear capabilities, including ICBM-range nuclear-armed HGVs, some of which will be deployed in the near future, if not already deployed. According to the report, China's nuclear stockpile has increased from 410 in January 2023 to 500 in January 2024. The report also states that the US, Russia, Britain, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel are all modernizing their nuclear arsenals.

The measures include deploying more police officers, using bulletproof vests, and drones to monitor the environment, which has become increasingly hostile for many. The process of electing a president in the US has become more risky since the 2020 campaign, when then-President Donald Trump promoted theories of massive electoral fraud and claimed that his victory was stolen from him by Democrat Joe Biden. Trump's supporters reacted with violence, attacking the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, during a joint session of Congress attempting to certify the election results. Many election officials have chosen to recuse themselves from this cycle, and those who remain will receive increased protection. In Washington D.C., Police Chief Pamela Smith announced that she has recruited around 4,000 national agents who will take an oath to help with inauguration security. Mayor Muriel Bowser also updated the city council on security plans from election day to the next president's inauguration. The reinforcement in the US capital may include the possibility of National Guard troops. 'We haven't submitted a request yet, but we've been actively involved with the Department of Defense and how that planning is carried out,' Bowser said. The collective memory is fearful of another post-election debacle like the one three years ago, which left five dead, over 140 police officers injured, and ongoing investigations and convictions. Trump has suggested that if he returns to the White House, he may pardon all those behind bars for their involvement in the incident.

However, the growing demand for energy, driven by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), is leading the country to reconsider its energy model. The energy nuclear, a non-renewable source that is being phased out in Taiwan, is once again being considered as a promising alternative to meet the increasing demand caused by AI. Indications of a change in direction. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Taiwanese Prime Minister Cho Jung-tai said he is 'very open' to nuclear energy. 'As long as there is a consensus within Taiwan on nuclear safety and good direction and guarantees for nuclear waste management, with this strong consensus, we can have a public discussion,' he said. The support for the use of nuclear reactors fell in 2011, just after Japan was hit by the earthquake that caused the Fukushima accident. Cho did not provide many details about his position, but noted that he expects his country to be able to keep up 'with global trends and new nuclear technologies.' The mention of 'new technologies' is not a minor detail. In fact, it is a key point that may favor the resurgence of nuclear energy in the island. We are witnessing the evolution of nuclear reactors live. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), like those that Google and Amazon want to use, promise to be less complex, but also more versatile, efficient, and safe. 'No nuclear' nation by 2025. Between 1977 and 1985, Taiwan had managed to put six nuclear reactors into operation, but things changed over time. This number did not increase, but rather decreased gradually. According to the Nuclear Safety Commission, the country had three nuclear power plants operated by the state-owned Taipower in January of this year. Two of them, Chinshan and Kuosheng, were in the process of being dismantled, while Maanshan was still operating, but had its days numbered. The government has been developing a policy of gradual elimination of nuclear energy with a deadline of 2025. But all this takes place in a complex scenario. On the one hand, Taiwan is on its way to becoming the first non-nuclear state in East Asia, a decision supported in some way by a referendum held in 2021 where the majority of voters rejected the possibility of restarting the construction of the two advanced reactors that had begun to be built, but whose project was suspended. Taiwan essentially depends on imported energy. The island imports around 97.73% of its energy needs. The goal of de-nuclearizing is accompanied by achieving an energy mix consisting of 50% liquefied natural gas (LNG), 27% coal, and 15% renewable energies. But this plan also has challenges, mainly from an environmental point of view. It is a fact that more energy is needed, but also that the different actors in the country must help reduce their emissions. In this point is where the rise of AI enters the scene, where several countries compete to lead its development. Taiwan has a leading role in this world. In the island, large language models like those of OpenAI, Microsoft or Google are not trained, but many of the advanced chips needed for this industry are manufactured. Let us remember that we are talking about the home of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which has chip manufacturing plants for clients like NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm, among others.

The National Weather Service predicts a 20% chance of rain on Sunday evening, with mostly cloudy skies and highs in the mid-40s to mid-50s for the rest of the week.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 03:32 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/much-rain-did-des-moines-150405394.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cDovL3Jzcy5uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9yc3MvdXM&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFJMHG0rB8emNh4hiqnH5V7zZ0CM0XdG4HVBcVsCHeweVNSvjncWLXUBGfQk_3jc3S_wPyvr5_v8gwBAl9bxL41OfYi5FV5W_vqG3i0KvHuDnLwcDW011biIZzUbWmMUNNywbqV35bdokelZ07LZxYCxevTxIuSDEp6WjHCrU54-)\n\n**More than 390 incidents attended due to rains in the country**\nSince October 31, when the National System for Civil Protection (Sinaproc) issued the first alert, at least 393 situations have been attended to due to the country's weather conditions. Landslides lead the list of incidents, with 202 reports, followed by 81 floods and 73 fallen trees. Roads affected, bridge collapses, and rescue operations have been part of the actions taken in recent days as a result of these events, which have already claimed the lives of eight people. According to Minister of Government Dinoska Montalvo, 'November has rained more in the first four days than it should have rained throughout the entire month.' Montalvo expressed her concern about the saturation of soils, which, combined with human intervention, has affected areas near rivers, modifying the reality and geography of the country. She added that 'this year we only have the capacity for reaction,' but a national plan for risk mitigation against disasters is expected to be implemented in 2025. For now, 'these alerts aim to safeguard the lives of citizens. If the population follows the instructions at the right time, it will help us greatly,' Montalvo said in a press conference where she presented the balance of the damage caused by the rains. 'We remain on yellow alert at the national level, but we are carrying out all the corresponding operations for a red alert, as the weather situation will persist until the first weeks of December,' she added.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 11:00 AM\nSource:[prensa.com](https://www.prensa.com/sociedad/mas-de-390-incidentes-atendidos-por-lluvias-en-el-pais/)\n\n**Ready or Not, Iowa’s First Snowfall is Coming Soon!**\nIowans can expect the first snowfall of the season soon, with Cedar Rapids typically seeing snow around November 18th.

Approximately 257 million Americans are under a severe drought warning. Many states have asked residents to reduce their water usage by limiting shower times, not watering their gardens, and reducing water flow in toilets to conserve resources. The situation was severe in Pennsylvania, leading to the drying up of a lake and the exposure of a 200-year-old bridge's remains. The hardest-hit areas include Texas, Ohio, West Virginia, Wyoming, Montana, and Missouri, all of which are facing extreme or exceptional drought conditions after no rainfall since September. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has described the event as a 'sudden drought' caused by below-average rainfall, above-average temperatures, and strong winds. According to the Southeast Regional Climate Center, at least 100 weather stations across the US recorded no precipitation in October. The drought is affecting major cities like Philadelphia, Atlanta, Birmingham, Dallas, Las Vegas, and Sacramento. The drought has persisted even in states like North Carolina and Georgia, which were hit by Hurricane Helen and experienced flooding of up to 15 feet in late September. NASA's Earth Observatory reported that many areas affected by the hurricane dried up quickly and have not seen any rainfall since the disaster. The drought has different levels, with D3 being severe, capable of halting crop and livestock production, increasing the severity of wildfires, and causing outbreaks of diseases like typhoid and cholera if people drink contaminated water. D4s is the most severe, causing widespread crop failure, severe water shortages, and potential environmental damage. Cities like New York City are also affected, with Mayor Eric Adams urging residents to conserve every drop of water by reducing the number of times they flush the toilet, taking shorter showers, and not letting water run while brushing their teeth. The warning comes as the city's water tanks in northern New York State are nearing depletion, with only a third of them filled, compared to the usual three-quarters at this time of year. The cotton industry has been severely affected by the drought, with the US expected to produce its second-lowest crop in a decade. Texas, the country's largest cotton producer, is expected to produce only 2.1 million acres of cotton this year, down from 5.5 million acres in 2022. Arkansas has also been affected, with many of its cornfields damaged.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 04:23 PM\nSource:[العين الإخبارية](https://al-ain.com/article/americans-flush-toilets-48-states-drought-warnings)\n\n**Entergy Arkansas reduces drawdown rate for Hamilton, Catherine due to summer drought**\nEntergy Arkansas has reduced the drawdown rate for lakes Hamilton and Catherine due to the ongoing summer drought. The lakes are now dropping at a rate of approximately 3 inches per day instead of the standard 6 inches. According to Heather Kendrick, a communications specialist with Entergy Arkansas, the slower drawdown is necessary to conserve water in Lake Ouachita, which is in its annual refill period. Kendrick stated, 'By slowing down the drawdown release we reduce the need to draw water from Lake Ouachita for a few days to help conserve water there.' The drawdown is expected to reach its low point on Tuesday, and the annual refill period is expected to start around March 1, with full pool expected to be reached no later than March 15.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 10:04 AM\nSource:[hotsr.com](https://www.hotsr.com/news/2024/nov/07/entergy-arkansas-reduces-drawdown-rate-for/)\n\n**US Election 2024: Severe Weather May Disrupt Voters in Key States**\nAccording to USA Today, severe weather conditions, including thunderstorms and snow, may disrupt voters in key states in the US. A strong cold front is expected to hit the central part of the country, threatening the region with scattered rain and thunderstorms. States like Michigan and Wisconsin, which are crucial in the election, may experience strong winds and rain as the front moves east. Isolated severe storms are also possible in the upper regions of Texas to central Louisiana and southern Arkansas to western Mississippi. The National Weather Service has warned of a continued threat of tornadoes in parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, which could pose a risk to voters and polling stations. Despite this, over 82 million Americans have already cast their votes through early voting, either in person or by mail. The US electoral system is complex, with the president not elected directly by popular vote, but through the Electoral College, a compromise between congressional and popular vote. The Electoral College is not a place, but a process of selecting and gathering electors, who vote to choose the president and vice president. The electors' votes are counted by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and a candidate needs to secure a majority of 270 votes to win the presidency. Each state in the Electoral College is represented by the same number of electors as its members in Congress, with each member of the House of Representatives and each Senator representing their state. The District of Columbia is allocated three electors and is treated as a state in the Electoral College under the 23rd Amendment to the US Constitution.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 04:22 PM\nSource:[youm7.com](https://www.youm7.com/story/2024/11/5/%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%A7-%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%B1%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AC-%D9%82%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%89-%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA/6766931)\n\n**Months of drought conditions complicate winter feed strategies**\nArkansas' cattle producers will have to start feeding hay earlier and longer due to the state's prolonged drought. According to Kenny Simon, extension forage educator for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture, the drought has impacted the growth of fescue and delayed the planting of warm-season perennial grasses. Simon said, 'Everyone's scared to plant because of how dry it is.' As a result, bermudagrass will not be available for grazing until later than normal in spring. The state's fescue pastures are growing unusually sparse, and Simon recommends using moveable electric fence to 'strip graze' the remaining forage. James Mitchell, extension livestock economist, said that much of the U.S. cattle industry has been in a 'liquidation phase,' with producers culling herds for much of the last five years. However, many Arkansas producers were able to stockpile enough hay to get through at least a normal year, and Simon said, 'I think most folks got the hay they need for a normal year, but these fall droughts may force people to start feeding three to four weeks early.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 03:30 PM\nSource:[stuttgartdailyleader.com](https://www.stuttgartdailyleader.com/months-of-drought-conditions-complicate-winter-feed-strategies/)\n\n**Post-drought Arkansas agriculture industry still seeing long term effect**\nRecent rain in Arkansas has had a mixed impact on the agriculture industry. While it has helped prevent wheat from drying out for cattle farmers, it has made harvests more difficult for row crop farmers. According to Henry Caldwell, the rain has kept wheat alive for when it is warm enough, but Johnathan Kubesch, a University of Arkansas extension specialist, notes that row crop farmers have a different opinion. The drought has already caused a switch from grazing, which normally waits until December, and the industry is hoping for a better year next year. As Caldwell said, 'A farmer, a cattleman, they always plan on next year being better, but don’t always (be) the case.' The University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture notes that droughts are expected to happen three out of every 10 years since the 1970s.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 12:30 AM\nSource:[kark.com](https://www.kark.com/news/state-news/post-drought-arkansas-agriculture-industry-still-seeing-long-term-effect/)\n\n**Prompted by drought, burn bans persist despite recent rain**\nDespite recent rain, dry conditions and outdoor burn bans persist in the River Valley. The Sebastian County Department of Emergency Management has extended the burn ban, citing the need for more precipitation and consistent moisture. The National Weather Service reports that drought conditions are expected to last through the end of January, with many farmers and producers in the area reporting signs of drought, including stressed mature trees, dry ponds, and cracked ground. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, about two-thirds of Sebastian County is at moderate drought status, while the rest is slightly better as it is considered abnormally dry. The region's drought has worsened in all of Northwest Arkansas except in Crawford County, where there was no change. The National Weather Service reports that the driest fall on record in Fort Smith is 1963, when just 3.07 inches of rain was recorded for all of September, October, and November.

Emergency Services Director Robert Murphy stated that the dry weather has contributed to the number and intensity of the fires. Crews, consisting of around 200 field workers, use bulldozers and planes with water tankers to combat the fires, with the time it takes to extinguish them depending on the size and location of the fire. Murphy hopes that the forecasted rain will alleviate the drought, but notes that a single inch of rain may not be enough to make a significant difference. 'If we get the rain that we are forecast to get in the next couple of days with the drought we’re in it probably won’t be a drought buster, but it will depend.' Murphy said.

According to the NOAA, La Niña will influence the environmental conditions between December 2024 and February 2025, leading to increased humidity in the northern regions of the US and a drier-than-usual winter in the south. The agency predicts a 71% chance of La Niña manifesting between September and November, with effects potentially persisting until January, February, and even March. The NOAA also warns that the appearance of this climate event in moderate to strong levels during the fall is less likely, but still possible. The agency anticipates that neutral conditions will return by the end of the first quarter of next year, between February and April. The NOAA's forecast indicates that the south and east of the US are likely to experience above-normal temperatures this winter, with the Gulf Coast, the Southeast, and the Northeast being the most probable regions to experience warm temperatures. On the other hand, the northwest Pacific, the northern Rocky Mountains, and the Great Plains are expected to experience colder-than-normal temperatures and closer to historical values, affecting states such as Oregon, Washington, Montana, northern Idaho, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa. La Niña is also characterized by producing increased humidity in the north and reduced humidity in the south. Therefore, for this winter, the NOAA predicts that regions such as the northwest, the Great Lakes, and the Northeast could experience higher levels of precipitation. However, this projection does not guarantee significant snowfall. In contrast, the southwest, the central-south, and the southeast of the country could face drier-than-usual conditions, with the Rio Grande Valley and the southern plains being the areas with the highest risk of prolonged drought. As a result, the risk of prolonged drought in states such as Texas, New Mexico, and to a lesser extent, Louisiana, Arizona, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, and southern California and Nevada will worsen this winter, potentially exacerbating conditions in areas already affected by water scarcity in recent months.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 06:52 PM\nSource:[LA NACION](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/llega-la-nina-la-noaa-actualizo-su-pronostico-para-este-invierno-y-anticipo-como-afectara-al-clima-nid23092024)\n\n**Somalia Key Message Update: PAfter disrupted gu production season, below-average deyr rainfall is likely, August 2024**\nWidespread Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to persist through at least January 2025 in Somalia.

All settlements hosting displaced populations are expected to face either Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes. The below-average deyr rainfall forecast for the upcoming October to December season is likely to contribute to a fourth consecutive season of below-average crop production, exacerbating food insecurity. Revised analysis indicates that the crop-dependent Sorghum High Potential and Bay Bakool Low Potential livelihood zones are expected to deteriorate to Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with most other agropastoral areas expected to continue facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. In northern and central pastoral areas, improved rangeland conditions, higher livestock birth rates, and increased milk production due to above-average gu rainfall are expected to improve food security for poor households through December. However, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to persist in the Addun and Coastal Deeh Pastoral livelihood zones of the central regions, which were badly impacted during the 2020-2022 drought.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 11:23 PM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-key-message-update-pafter-disrupted-gu-production-season-below-average-deyr-rainfall-likely-august-2024)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

This move will fuel competition in the search market, with Google's Gemini AI model already integrated into its search engine and Microsoft using OpenAI's KI-technology for its Bing co-pilot. Amazon is also making inroads, with its search market share growing faster than Google's in the US, according to eMarketer. Amazon's share of search advertising revenue is expected to rise to 22.3% in the US this year, while Google's share will decline to 50.5%.

The company's AI-powered search feature, AI Overviews, has been met with mixed reactions, with some users praising its ability to provide accurate and relevant results, while others have criticized its reliance on artificial intelligence and its tendency to prioritize automated responses over human input. Meanwhile, Microsoft's Bing search engine has been gaining ground, with a 7.27% market share in the US, making it the second-largest search engine in the world. Yahoo, another long-time competitor, is also making a comeback, with a new design and features that aim to attract both old and new users. The report also highlights the growing importance of local search engines, such as Baidu in China and Yandex in Russia, which have carved out a niche for themselves in their respective markets.

While it may take years for any concrete action to be taken, the argument that the market is changing could play a role. Amazon is already gaining ground in the advertising market, with a projected 24.2% share next year, as users increasingly search for products directly on the e-commerce platform. Other players, such as TikTok and Perplexity, a startup backed by Jeff Bezos, are also emerging as potential competitors, with TikTok allowing businesses to target ads based on user requests and Perplexity planning to integrate advertising into its AI platform. As Google's market share declines, the company's lawyers may be taking note, with one source reportedly printing out the statistic and hanging it on the wall of their office, according to Corriere della Sera.

Despite this, Google will remain the largest player in the search market, holding a 48% share of search ad revenue in the US. However, Amazon is growing faster and is expected to surpass Google's market share in the search ad market. Amazon is expected to control around 27% of search ad revenue in the US by 2026, while Google's share will decline. This does not mean that users will have to switch to Bing or Yahoo, as this does not mean the end of Google or anything close to it. Google is still the fourth-largest company in the world in terms of market value, with a value of $2.1 trillion. The company remains dominant in other markets, including display advertising, which it leads alongside Meta, the parent company of Facebook and YouTube. Each of these companies is larger than Delta Air Lines' entire market value, so Google will not disappear. However, Google faces several threats, including antitrust lawsuits. A federal judge in San Francisco recently ruled that Google must open its Play Store to competitors, dealing a significant blow to the company in its long-running battle with Epic Games. Google has said it will appeal the ruling. In August, the company lost another ruling when a federal court found that Google was engaging in anti-competitive behavior in the search market, which could ultimately lead to the breakup of the company's search business. There is another antitrust battle underway, with Google being accused of abusing its dominance in the online advertising market. At the same time, European regulatory bodies have forced Google to comply with new, strict rules, and its violations have resulted in multiple fines exceeding $1 billion. TikTok has also entered the search market, and Amazon has done something that few other large technology companies have been able to do, using Google to sell its own products and then selling ads to other companies to promote their products on Google.

According to a recent WSJ report, the company's market share could fall below 50% by 2025, a first in over a decade. The causes of this transformation are emerging competitors and artificial intelligence (AI), which have changed the dynamics of how and where users search. Amazon and TikTok are among the main rivals, with Amazon increasing its market share significantly by attracting more advertisers who want to capitalize on the trend of users starting their searches directly on their platform. TikTok has also started allowing search-based ads, capturing the attention of a young audience that now searches for not only entertainment but also information and products. The role of AI is also key in this change, with tools like Perplexity providing direct answers to user questions, rather than lists of links like Google. This not only saves time but also presents new forms of advertising, where advertisers can sponsor follow-up questions, integrating into the conversation in a natural and targeted way. Google has tried to adapt by introducing AI-generated summaries in its search results, although this strategy has not been well received by all users.

According to The Wall Street Journal, both TikTok and AI companies are poised to enter this market soon.

Some advertisers have already tested this feature, committing to spend at least $10,000 per month for two months, and have seen positive results, particularly in the electronics, clothing, and beauty industries.

This would still be a significant lead over Amazon, which is expected to account for around 22% of ad revenue in 2024. Google's market share has been declining for years. The Wall Street Journal has spoken with analysts and companies who agree that there will be significant changes due to artificial intelligence and advertising directly on online platforms. Amazon's growth, which has been steadily eroding Google's market share since 2020, is largely driven by ads on Amazon itself. Consumers are increasingly searching for products on Amazon first, rather than using a search engine. The platforms are increasingly tailoring ads to the user's profile, similar to what Google has always done. TikTok is reportedly offering its large advertisers the ability to play ads based on a user's previous search queries. Google is also working with machine learning, showing some users summaries of text from search results directly on the search page. Google's Chief of Ads for Search, Brendon Kraham, said, 'We were already at a point where we had to deal with such changes.' The competition in the estimated $300 billion market for ads in online searches is not only coming from established platforms like Amazon and TikTok, but also from a new AI startup, Perplexity AI, which is backed by Jeff Bezos. Perplexity AI will soon start serving ads, allowing advertisers to precisely control how their brand is represented in the search engine's responses.

Trump's nominees, including Senator Marco Rubio, Representative Elise Stefanik, and Representative Michael Waltz, will need Senate confirmation before taking office. If confirmed, they will resign from their seats, which will remain vacant until special elections are held in 2026.

Ryan Stubenrauch, a former assistant attorney general under DeWine, believes the list of potential replacements is short and mentions Jane Timken, Frank LaRose, and Ohio Lt. Gov.

He stated, 'I want to have the greatest impact possible in this country.' Timken, a 58-year-old former President of the Ohio Republican Party, has also been mentioned as a potential candidate.

DeWine is keeping his cards close to his chest, but electability is an important factor. Potential names include Vivek Ramaswamy, Jane Timken, State Sen. Matt Dolan, and Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who have all expressed interest in the appointment or have been mentioned as possibilities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 10:47 AM\nSource:[Cincinnati](https://eu.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/06/jd-vance-replacement-ohio-senate-seat/75827069007/)\n\n**DeWine May Name Vance Foe Dolan To Senate Seat**\nOhio Governor Mike DeWine is reportedly considering appointing State Senator Matt Dolan to fill the Senate seat of J.D. Vance, assuming he is elected vice president. However, this move is met with outrage from MAGA Republicans and conservatives, who view Dolan as an 'establishment Republican.' DeWine has stated that the appointee must be able to raise money for a primary in 2026 and the special election, as well as the election for a full term in 2028. Potential candidates include Republican U.S. Representatives David Joyce and Mike Carey, as well as former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who is a close friend of Vance and his wife. Democrats are likely to mount a strong special election campaign, with former Representative Tim Ryan considered their 'best bet.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 07:32 AM\nSource:[NewsMax](https://www.newsmax.com/politics/mike-dewine-j-d-vance-matt-dolan/2024/11/06/id/1186903/)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

More GOP Lawmakers Want Trump's Daughter-In-Law To Take Rubio's Seat**\nA growing coalition of President-elect Donald Trump's allies are backing his daughter-in-law Lara Trump to replace Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., if he's confirmed as Secretary of State. Lara Trump expressed her interest in the role, saying, 'If I were tapped for this, serving my home state now of Florida, it's a great honor and a great responsibility.' If Rubio is confirmed, DeSantis would be responsible for selecting his replacement until the 2026 election, when voters would choose who serves out the remainder of Rubio's term through 2028.

Wiles is the first woman to hold this position. Trump is expected to make further personnel announcements in the coming days. Meanwhile, in Washington, there is a sense of calm, as President Joe Biden spends the weekend at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Wiles, a 67-year-old Republican strategist, has been a key advisor to Trump and is known for her loyalty and discretion. Trump described her as 'hard, smart, and innovative, and admired and respected by all.' Wiles has been active in politics for decades and has worked for various Republican politicians. She is expected to take office on January 20, when Trump is sworn in. The appointment of Wiles has raised questions about the future of the Supreme Court, with some speculating that Biden may try to appoint a new justice before he leaves office. The court has been shifted to the right under Trump, with only three liberal justices remaining. Biden has already appointed one justice, but the majority remains unchanged. The fate of liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is 70, is uncertain, and some speculate that Biden may try to appoint a new justice if she retires. However, this would require strategic maneuvering by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been relatively quiet since Trump's victory, with no public appearances scheduled. The outcome of the election is still unclear, with the results of the presidential election still being counted and certified in the states. The official results must be finalized by December 11, and the Electoral College will meet on December 17 to cast their votes.

Trump said in his victory speech: 'Suzie loves to stay in the background... Let me tell you, we call her 'Snowflake'... She loves to stay in the background, but she's never there.' According to The Hill, Waiels usually stays in the background, but she appeared last week with a post on social media platform X, her first post in nearly two years, defending Trump against comments made by billionaire Mark Cuban that the former president is usually surrounded by 'strong and smart women.' Waiels wrote in her first post on the platform since February 2023: 'I learned that Mark Cuban needs help identifying strong and smart women surrounding President Trump. Well, here we are... I'm proud to lead this campaign,' also mentioning the efforts of Linda McMahon, Trump's transition policy chief, and Lara Trump, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Waiels currently serves as the co-chair of Trump's campaign alongside Chris LaCivita, and there are speculations that she may become the White House Chief of Staff in the new Republican administration. Politico previously described her as Trump's most important advisor, and she has worked in politics for several decades, working with presidents, mayors, governors, and members of Congress, including Senator Rick Scott of Florida and Governor Ron DeSantis. She also worked with Trump in his 2016 and 2024 campaigns, and according to Reuters, she worked as a deputy director during Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign and later became responsible for scheduling his office, and also worked as a consultant in Florida.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 03:31 PM\nSource:[youm7.com](https://www.youm7.com/story/2024/11/7/%D8%A3%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%82-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%B7%D9%81%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D9%84%D8%AC-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%87%D9%89-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B2%D9%89-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%84%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%B4%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7/6769491)\n\n**Who is Lara Trump, US President-elect Donald Trump's new 'right hand woman' ?**\nLara Trump, the wife of Donald Trump's son Eric, has been appointed as the co-chair of the Republican National Committee and has been a prominent part of Donald Trump's election campaign. She has delivered resounding speeches and stood next to the President-elect on stage during massive rallies.

Some of the individuals being considered for key positions include Elon Musk, who has been a strong supporter of Trump, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal critic of vaccines. Musk, who has been a vocal supporter of Trump, is expected to be appointed to a role that would allow him to 'abolish bureaucracy and fire public servants.'

Other key figures in the new environment include Susi Wiles and Chris LaCivita, masterminds behind Trump's campaign. Wiles is a top contender for the position of White House Chief of Staff, the most important role in the White House after the President. Linda McMahon, a wrestling magnate, and Howard Lutnick, president of investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald, will be instrumental in shaping Trump's future cabinet until January 20, the day of his inauguration.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 03:47 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/el-nuevo-centro-de-poder-quienes-son-los-familiares-y-asesores-que-acompanaron-a-trump-en-su-noche-nid06112024/)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."
