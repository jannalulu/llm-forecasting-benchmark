**Can "Glicked" save the box office?**
The highly anticipated films 'Wicked' and 'Gladiator II' have hit theaters, and Hollywood executives are eager to see if they will be box office successes. Estimates predict 'Wicked' will earn $100-$110 million and 'Gladiator II' will earn $65-$80 million in their opening weekend. However, the casts of both films are under pressure to deliver, citing the need for a box office boost after a year of flops. As Paul Mescal, star of 'Gladiator II', said, 'The box office needs a shot in the arm, and if films like Gladiator II aren't doing it, it would be concerning.' If these films fail to meet expectations, it could be a significant blow to the box office, which has struggled in recent years.

**From Deadpool and Wolverine to Dune: Part Two, all 10 of the highest-grossing movies of 2024 are sequels - and it's the first time that's happened in at least 50 years**
For the first time in at least 50 years, all 10 of the highest-grossing movies of 2024 are sequels, according to Box Office Mojo. The top 3 spots are held by Inside Out 2, Deadpool and Wolverine, and Despicable Me 4. Dune: Part Two and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire round out the top 5. Gabriel Rossman, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles, notes that box office numbers have mostly recovered from the COVID era but are still at 75% of pre-COVID levels. Disney CEO Bob Iger believes that sequels are a safer bet for studios, but it's unclear if they're actually saving theaters. The top 10 movies of 2024 have made approximately $7.5 billion at the box office, a decline from previous years. However, the release of Wicked, a prequel to The Wizard of Oz, may shake up the current ranking and potentially take the third spot.

Embracer, the owner of the 'Lord of the Rings' franchise, reported a 21% drop in net sales across its gaming group to $782 million, with a 10% drop in entertainment and services sales.

**What Venom 3's Box Office Means For Sony's Next 2024 Marvel Movie**
Venom: The Last Dance's box office performance suggests that Sony's next Marvel movie, Kraven the Hunter, has a chance to be successful. Despite a disappointing opening weekend, the film is holding up better than expected in its second weekend, earning $26.1 million and topping the weekend box office charts. The film's success is a positive sign for the Sony Spider-Man Universe, which has been a mixed bag since 2018's Venom. However, Kraven the Hunter faces tough competition during the holiday season, including The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim and Mufasa: The Lion King. The film's R rating could also affect its box office, as families are looking for family-friendly entertainment during the holidays. Nevertheless, Kraven the Hunter has a talented cast and crew, and positive word-of-mouth could help it perform well at the box office.

**I Think I Understand The War Of The Rohirrim's Divisive Main Character Choice**
The upcoming Lord of the Rings movie, The War of the Rohirrim, has chosen Helm Hammerhand's daughter, Hèra, as its main character, which has caused confusion among fans. However, the director, Kenji Kamiyama, may have made this choice to protect Helm's myth and enigma by not creating too much original dialogue for him. Helm Hammerhand will still feature heavily in the movie, voiced by Brian Cox, and his pivotal moment will be shown in the trailer. The movie's decision to adapt The House of Eorl, a short story from J.R.R. Tolkien's magnum opus, may seem odd, but it could be an opportunity to explore the human side of the Lord of the Rings universe. The movie will be released on December 13, 2024.

**‘Transformers One,' ‘Wild Robot' Keep Animation Working Overtime At 2024 Box Office**
The animated films 'Transformers One' and 'The Wild Robot' have contributed significantly to the 2024 box office, earning nearly $45 million last weekend. 'Transformers One' took in $40 million from less than half of its global markets, while 'The Wild Robot' pulled in $7 million from eight markets. The films have received positive critical reception and audience scores, which will help with word of mouth and buzz. However, the animation industry may face challenges due to continued Covid and flu outbreaks, as well as kids being back in school, which could impact weekday attendance and repeat weekend viewing. Despite this, animation is expected to contribute over $5 billion to the 2024 box office, with upcoming releases such as 'Piece By Piece', 'Spellbound', 'Moana 2', 'The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim', and 'Mufasa: The Lion King' expected to add an additional $2.5 to $3 billion.

**Explore a New Side of Middle-earth in New 'The Lord of the Rings: War of the Rohirrim' Poster**
A new poster for the upcoming animated feature, The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, has been released. The film, set 183 years before the events of Peter Jackson's original trilogy, follows the story of Héra, a revered name from J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium. The film's director, Kenji Kamiyama, has stated that the animated feature has a strong female representation, with Héra as the main protagonist and Éowyn as the narrator. Kamiyama said, 'In Japanese animation, it's not uncommon for a female protagonist to be the main character, but it's more rare in the live-action films made from The Lord of the Rings. Our film has a strong female lead in Héra, and our story is narrated by the noble Tolkien figure Éowyn, so women are very well represented.' The film is set to premiere on December 13, 2024, and will be directed by Kenji Kamiyama, with original contributors from The Lord of the Rings trilogy serving as executive producers.
