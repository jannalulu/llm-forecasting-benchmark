**Average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the US rises to highest level since July**
The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the US has risen to 6.84%, its highest level since July, according to Freddie Mac. This increase can add hundreds of dollars to monthly borrowing costs, reducing homebuyers' purchasing power in a market where home prices remain near all-time highs. In contrast, the average rate on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages rose to 6.02% from 5.99% last week. Despite this, US home sales are on track for their worst year since 1995.

**Mortgage and refinance rates for Nov. 18, 2024: Average rates for 30-year, 15-year terms remain elevated**
As of November 18, 2024, the average mortgage rates remain elevated, with a 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.92% for purchase and 6.92% for refinance. The 15-year mortgage rate stands at 6.18% for purchase and 6.21% for refinance. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate is 6.78%, down 1 basis point from last week's average. The Federal Reserve has announced a quarter-point cut to its federal funds target interest rate, citing 'labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low' while acknowledging a 'somewhat elevated' inflation rate. Economists estimate another rate cut in December with additional cuts in 2025. 'After a six-week climb, rates have leveled off, but overall affordability continues to be an issue for potential homebuyers,' says Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. 'Our latest research shows that mortgage payments compared to rents on the same homes are elevated relative to most of the last three decades.'

The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the US has slipped to 6.78%, down from 6.79% last week, according to Freddie Mac. This marks the end of a six-week climb.

Elevated mortgage rates and high prices have contributed to the US housing market's sales slump since 2022.

**Mortgage and refinance rates for Nov. 15, 2024: Average rates end week moderately lower as inflation rises**
Mortgage rates have decreased moderately as of Friday, November 15, 2024, with the current average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage at 6.91% for purchase and 6.90% for refinance. This is down 1 basis point from 6.92% for purchase and 3 basis points from 6.93% for refinance this time last Friday. The Federal Reserve's decision to lower the federal funds target interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.50% to 4.75% on November 7, 2024, is expected to have a positive impact on mortgage rates.

Mortgage rates for November 12, 2024, are relatively steady, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.90% for purchase and 6.87% for refinance.

**Mortgage and refinance rates today, November 8, 2024: Rates surpass the 52-week average**
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has increased for the sixth consecutive week, reaching 6.79%, which is above the 52-week average of 6.76%. According to Freddie Mac, interest rates are unlikely to decrease significantly in 2024, but are expected to drop gradually through 2025. If you're planning to buy a home, holding out for lower rates might not be worth it. Mortgage rates are still lower than they were last November, but 30-year fixed rates have increased for six consecutive weeks. Mortgage rates are expected to decline in 2025, making it a better time to refinance. 'A lot is up in the air right now,' says Laura Grace Tarpley, CEPF, Lead Editor and Content Strategist, Mortgages. 'If you want to buy a house in 2024, now is as good a time as any. But if you aren't in any rush, you may want to hold out until 2025.'

**Average Mortgage Rate Rises for Fifth Straight Week**
The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. rose for the fifth straight week, reaching 6.72% from 6.54% last week, according to Freddie Mac. This is the highest level since early August. Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages also increased, rising to 5.99% from 5.71% last week. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors such as the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions and data on inflation and the economy. Economists predict mortgage rates will remain choppy this year, but generally forecast them to ease in 2025, which could help boost homebuyers' purchasing power and lead to higher home prices if more buyers enter the market. As said by Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, 'With several potential inflection points happening over the next week, including the jobs report, the 2024 election, and the Federal Reserve interest rate decision, we can expect mortgage rates to remain volatile.'

**Mortgage Rates Jump for Fifth Week, With 30-Year Reaching 6.72%**
Mortgage rates in the US have risen for the fifth consecutive week, with the average 30-year fixed loan rate reaching 6.72%. This increase follows a steady climb since late September, when the 30-year average hit a two-year low of 6.08%. Strong economic reports have bolstered the case for a slower pace of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which is scheduled to meet next week. According to Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, 'With several potential inflection points happening over the next week, including the jobs report, the 2024 election and the Federal Reserve interest-rate decision, we can expect mortgage rates to remain volatile.'

The average rate on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the US has risen to 6.54% from 6.44% last week, according to Freddie Mac. This is the fourth consecutive week of increases, suggesting that the housing market may remain sluggish despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts. Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, said, 'The continued strength in the economy drove mortgage rates higher once again this week.' The rate was 7.79% during the same period last year. The increase is attributed to solid economic data, such as retail sales and national account revisions, which have led traders to abandon hopes for another 50-basis-point rate cut from the Fed next month.

According to Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, 'The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased for the third consecutive week, moving closer to 6.5%.'

**US 30-Year Fixed Mortgage Rate Rises to 6.32% Amid Strong Economic Data**
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate in the US has risen to 6.32% this week, marking the largest weekly increase since April. Freddie Mac announced on Thursday that the rate is now 20 basis points above the previous week's average of 6.12%. This increase is closely tied to recent economic data that has exceeded expectations, leading investors to reassess their predictions for future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The mortgage rate typically moves in sync with the 10-year Treasury bond yield, which rose after strong employment growth in September and a decline in the unemployment rate. These indicators have led market operators to anticipate more modest and less frequent rate cuts by the Fed in the coming months. This rise in mortgage rates breaks a downward trend that had been observed since May, when the market was preparing for the Fed to initiate a rate cut, which began last month. Current market projections suggest that the Fed's benchmark rate, currently between 4.75% and 5.00%, could fall to a range of 3.50% to 3.75% by mid-next year.

**US 30-Year Fixed Mortgage Rate Rises to 6.32%**
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate in the US has risen to 6.32% this week, marking the largest weekly increase since April. According to Freddie Mac, this rate is 20 basis points higher than the previous week's average of 6.12%. Last year at this time, the rate was 7.57%. This increase is attributed to recent economic data exceeding expectations, causing investors to reassess their predictions for future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The mortgage rate often aligns with the 10-year Treasury yield, which has risen following strong employment growth in September and a decline in unemployment. This has led traders to anticipate fewer and smaller rate cuts from the Fed in the coming months. The rise in mortgage rates reverses a trend of declining rates since May, when the market expected the Fed to begin reducing rates, which started last month. Current market predictions suggest that the Fed's benchmark rate, currently between 4.75% and 5.00%, could be lowered to between 3.50% and 3.75% by mid-year next year.

**Average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. ticks up to 6.12%, first increase in 7 weeks**
The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. rose to 6.12% this week, the first increase in seven weeks, according to Freddie Mac. This comes after the rate slipped to its lowest level in two years last week, boosting home shoppers' purchasing power. However, mortgage rates are still down from their 2024 peak of 7.22% in May. Freddie Mac Chief Economist Sam Khater remains optimistic, stating that 'zooming out to the bigger picture, mortgage rates have declined one and a half percentage points over the last 12 months, home price growth is slowing, inventory is increasing, and incomes continue to rise.' Fannie Mae projects the rate on a 30-year mortgage will average 6.2% in the October-December quarter and decline to an average of 5.7% in the same quarter next year.

According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to a 2-year low, averaging 6.08% for the week ending September 26. This is down from 6.09% last week and 7.31% a year ago. Freddie Mac's chief economist, Sam Khater, stated, 'Although this week's decline was slight, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage trended down to its lowest level in two years.' The decline in rates has led to an increase in refinance activity, allowing homeowners to trim their monthly mortgage payments. However, homebuyers are waiting to see if rates decrease further as additional economic data is released. Dayton-area home sales were flat in August compared to last year, but local housing projects continue to grow.
