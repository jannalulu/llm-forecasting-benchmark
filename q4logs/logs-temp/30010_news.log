**Bridge Collapse in Crimea Halts Freight Transportation**
A car bridge on the Djankoy-Maslovka highway in the temporarily occupied Crimea region of Ukraine collapsed on November 13, causing a halt in freight transportation, including military cargo, according to Russian pro-Kremlin propagandists. The bridge allegedly collapsed under the weight of a truck. The Russian propagandists claim that the communication between the occupied Djankoy region in Crimea and the mainland Ukraine has not been restored yet. Additionally, the movement on the Solenoe Ozero - Djankoy road section has also been suspended.

**Crimean Bridge Automobile Traffic Resumes**
Automobile traffic on the Crimean Bridge has been resumed, according to a Telegram channel monitoring the situation on the bridge's approaches. 'Traffic of vehicles on the Crimean Bridge has been resumed,' the channel reports. The bridge's automobile traffic was temporarily halted earlier, but the stop lasted less than an hour. The bridge's automobile traffic is periodically halted in case of a threat of attack from Ukrainian armed formations. After the Ukrainian drone attack on the Crimean Bridge on July 17, 2023, its automobile part was damaged, and later the bridge resumed work in a reverse mode. Additionally, on October 8, a cargo truck exploded on the Crimean Bridge, damaging three spans of the automobile section. The cargo's cisterns caught fire, and three people were killed in the blast, according to preliminary data from the Russian Investigative Committee. On October 12, the FSB reported that they had uncovered the terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge, naming the organizer as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. The bridge was later restored. In July last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that plans to enhance the Crimean Bridge's security were being considered and would be implemented. He noted that it was premature to evaluate these plans before they were implemented. Putin emphasized that after completing all tasks, measures to enhance the bridge's security would be noticeable, referring to physical and technical protection. 'It's about this, not about some ideological content of the Crimean Bridge's protection,' he said.

**Russia Charges Ukrainian Security Chief with Crimean Bridge Terror Attack**
Russian investigators have charged the head of the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU), Vasyl Malyuk, with organizing a terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge in 2023, according to TASS. Malyuk has been accused of committing a terrorist act that resulted in the death of people, under article 'b' of chapter 3 of the Criminal Code, which carries a life sentence. The investigation found that Malyuk's involvement in the attack was confirmed by the results of operational and search activities. Malyuk has been arrested in absentia in Russia on another terrorism-related case. The Russian Foreign Ministry demanded in March 2024 that Ukraine immediately arrest and extradite Malyuk. Malyuk himself had previously admitted to planning the October 2022 attack on the Crimean Bridge, saying, 'I personally planned the terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge.' The Crimean Bridge has been repeatedly attacked by drones and shelled by Ukraine since the start of the conflict. In October 2022, a truck exploded on the bridge, causing damage to two road spans and killing three people. Later, on July 17, 2023, two unmanned boats struck the bridge, killing two people and causing significant damage to the road and rail sections.

**Crimea News: Rocket Attack, New Reservoirs, and Eco-Tech Parks**
The Ukrainian military attempted to attack Sevastopol with a rocket, but it was shot down by the city's air defense systems. The governor of the region, Mikhail Razvozhayev, reported that no civilian objects were damaged and the sirens sounded for 13 minutes. The Crimean Bridge was temporarily closed for over 20 minutes. Meanwhile, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that Crimea is a de facto Russian region, despite international non-recognition. He also mentioned that the de jure status of the peninsula is resolved in a one-sided manner. In other news, two new reservoirs will be built on the southern coast of Crimea to supply water to Yalta and Alushta. Three eco-tech parks are expected to be completed in 2025 in the Saky, Belogorsk, and Lenin districts. The director of the Crimean safari park announced that the lions that killed the park manager, Leokadiya Perevalova, will not be euthanized and will remain in the park's enclosures. Climate expert Boris Vakhrukhin warned that changes in the Gulf Stream could lead to a new ice age in Europe and warming in Russia, including Crimea.

**Crimean Bridge Temporarily Closed to Traffic**
The Crimean Bridge has been temporarily closed to traffic, according to the operational Telegram channel of the information center on the situation on the bridge. The reasons for the closure are not specified. Those on the bridge and in the inspection area are advised to remain calm and follow the instructions of transportation security personnel. The Crimean Bridge has been a target of Ukrainian forces, who have repeatedly attempted to attack it with rockets and have carried out two terrorist attacks. The first attack occurred on October 8, 2022, when a truck exploded on the road section of the bridge, causing a fire that destroyed seven fuel tanks. Three people were killed in the blast. The bridge's two automobile spans were partially destroyed, but were repaired by December. On July 17, 2023, Ukraine launched a drone attack on the bridge, killing two people and injuring their 14-year-old daughter. The bridge's road section was damaged, but was restored by autumn.

**Crimean Bridge 'Hidden' in Smoke as Russians Claim Rocket Threat**
On Thursday, October 17, Russians announced a supposed rocket threat on the Crimean peninsula, triggering a siren and claiming that their air defense systems were active in Sevastopol. As a result, they blocked traffic on the Crimean Bridge and 'hid' the bridge in a smoke screen. The Russians traditionally blamed a rocket attack on the bridge, with explosions heard nearby. This is not the first time the bridge has been targeted; on October 8, 2022, a truck was detonated, causing an explosion and fire. Putin called it a 'terrorist act' and formed a government commission, while Russia accused the SBU of possible involvement. In July 2023, the bridge was attacked again, with two spans destroyed, and the SBU chief, Malyuk, confirmed that the operation was carried out using Sea Baby drones. The Russians have been preparing for an unprecedented attack on the Crimean Bridge, so additional air defense systems have been deployed in the Kerch region.

**Crimea Prepares for Potential Ukrainian Attacks Ahead of US Elections**
The head of the State Council of Crimea, Vladimir Konstantinov, stated that the Ukrainian regime will attempt to attack the region before the US elections in order to show success to their Western sponsors. 'There are only a few weeks left until the US elections, and the Ukrainian gang needs to show their success. They know how to market themselves on this and will try to do any harm, wherever they can find a weak spot. They have no moral limits,' Konstantinov said. He emphasized that the Russian Armed Forces, law enforcement agencies, and authorities are taking necessary measures to ensure the security of the region. According to Sergey Gorbachev, a military expert, the main threats to Crimea come from the Odessa and Nikolaev regions, as well as the right bank of the Kherson region. The Ukrainian military uses a wide range of combat means, including Storm Shadow and ATACMS missiles, launched from modernized Su-24 bombers. The head of the SVR, Sergey Naryshkin, previously stated that the Crimean Bridge remains a top priority target for Ukrainian attacks using British Storm Shadow missiles.

**Georgian and Ukrainian Citizens Wanted for 2022 Crimean Bridge Bombing**
Law enforcement has issued an international arrest warrant for Georgian citizen Alexander Inasaridze and Ukrainian citizen Sergei Andreyenko, who are suspected of participating in the 2022 bombing of the Crimean Bridge. According to the investigation materials, both men are accused of committing a terrorist act and smuggling explosive materials. Their accomplices have also been charged, as reported by TASS. The first attack on the Crimean Bridge occurred on October 8, 2022, when a cargo vehicle was detonated, causing partial collapse of two road sections. However, the arch above the navigational section of the bridge remained intact. A second explosion occurred on July 17, 2023, resulting in the death of a family from the Belgorod region, with their minor daughter surviving. As noted by 'Evening Moscow', 'the incident is a reminder of the ongoing security concerns in the region.'

**Russia Charges Ukrainian Security Service Head with Organizing Crimean Bridge Attack**
The Russian Investigative Committee has charged the head of the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU), Vasyl Malyuk, with organizing a terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge in July 2023. The charges were brought under the article 'Terrorism, resulting in the death of people', which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. According to the investigation, there is sufficient evidence to link Malyuk to the attack, including the results of operational and search activities. The Crimean Bridge was attacked twice, first on October 8, 2022, and again on July 17, 2023, resulting in the deaths of four and one person, respectively. The Russian Ministry of Defense stated that it had carried out a retaliatory strike against targets involved in the preparation of terrorist attacks against Russia. Additionally, a court has ordered the arrest of Malyuk's property, including a land plot, two non-residential premises, and a trailer.

**Russia Charges SBU Head Malyuk with Organizing Crimean Bridge Blast**
Russia has charged the head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), Vasyl Malyuk, with organizing a terrorist act on the Crimean Bridge in 2023. According to TASS, a Russian state agency, the attack on the bridge was classified as a 'terrorist act'. Malyuk was previously charged with a similar offense, the destruction of the Crimean Bridge in 2022. In March 2024, Malyuk stated that Ukraine had conducted two successful operations in the area of the Crimean Bridge. The Crimean Bridge connects the temporarily occupied Crimea to Russian territory. There were two explosions on the Crimean Bridge, one in October 2022 and another in July 2023. Russian authorities and law enforcement accused Ukrainian special services of the blasts. Malyuk said that the SBU used a truck with 21 tons of explosives wrapped in a thick plastic sheet to destroy the bridge in October 2022. The second blast was carried out using Sea Baby drones. Malyuk also stated that Russia no longer uses the Crimean Bridge to transport arms after being hit by Ukrainian special services.

**Russia Warns of Western Missile Threat to Crimean Bridge**
According to Sergey Naryshkin, the head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), the Crimean Bridge has been attacked by Ukraine multiple times. He stated that the bridge is likely to be a target for Western-supplied Storm Shadow missiles. Naryshkin also mentioned that Ukraine has used Western-provided weapons to attack the Crimean Peninsula, including a June attack using US-supplied ATACMS missiles that killed 4 people and injured over 150 on a beach in Sevastopol. He recalled a statement by CIA Director William Burns that US military aid to Ukraine is intended to cause 'tangible harm to Russia', including 'attacks that penetrate Crimea'. The Crimean Bridge was built from 2016-2018 after Crimea officially joined the Russian Federation in 2014. Despite Moscow building a new land bridge to Crimea, Kiev still claims sovereignty over the peninsula and has sought to destroy the Crimean Bridge, which it alleges was built illegally. In January, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky admitted that Kiev 'really wants to destroy' the Crimean Bridge and other Russian infrastructure. Since the 2022 conflict began, the Crimean Bridge has been attacked multiple times by missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In October 2022, a truck carrying explosives exploded on the bridge, causing significant damage and killing 3 people. In July 2023, a UAV attack also damaged the bridge's structure and killed 2 people.

**Crimean Bridge Destroyed by 21 Tons of Explosives in TNT Equivalent**
The Crimean Bridge was destroyed on October 8, 2022, using 21 tons of explosives in TNT equivalent, according to Artem Dehtiar, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Security Service. 'We managed to blow up the Crimean Bridge in October 2022 using a truck with explosives. The explosives were disguised as rolls of plastic film. The weight of the explosives was 21 tons in TNT equivalent,' Dehtiar said. 'After each special operation, the enemy increases security measures. Currently, especially after the second blow by the SBU, additional air defense systems and bonus structures in the sea have been installed on the Crimean Bridge to protect it from sea drones. But the Security Service does not stand still, technologies change, we constantly improve our developments and look for better solutions,' the SBU spokesperson said. 'This was a simultaneous blow to the object that provides the enemy's military needs and to Putin's pride,' Dehtiar stated. 'We did not just cut off the enemy's logistics corridor for delivering arms to the front, we also destroyed the myth of the extraordinary protection of this object. And separately, I would like to emphasize that the Crimean Bridge, through which the Russians transported troops and military equipment to the southern front of Ukraine, is an absolutely legitimate target for our state,' Dehtiar said. The Kerch Bridge is doomed, and after Ukraine's victory, the Black Sea will become a popular place for diving, the SBU spokesperson said. The SBU has two successful hits on the Crimean Bridge: the first in October 2022 using a truck with explosives and the second in July 2023 using sea drones, said Vasyl Malyuk, the head of the SBU. In October 2022, SBU sea drones attacked enemy ships in the Sevastopol Bay, damaging four military vessels, including the frigate Admiral Makarov. Last year, SBU drones hit enemy missile carriers 'Samum' and 'Pavel Davydov', a tanker 'SIG', a landing ship 'Olenegorsky Gornyak', caused damage to a military tugboat 'Nikolay Muru' and a reconnaissance-hydrographic ship 'Vladimir Kositsky'.

**The SBU's Crimean Bridge Explosion: A Turning Point in the War**
Two years after the Crimean Bridge explosion, the consequences of the attack are still being felt. According to political analyst Alexei Golobutsky, the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) showed that the battle for the Black Sea can be won with creative and technological solutions. 'Even now, two years after the explosion, the Russians have not fully coped with the consequences. They cannot use the bridge to supply arms to the southern front, where the situation is much calmer than on the Donbass and Kharkov fronts. They no longer dare to transport heavy military equipment and ammunition by the bridge,' Golobutsky writes. The expert notes that the explosion marked the beginning of the 'period of stagnation' on the peninsula. He recalls that after the first explosion, the SBU was able to blow up the bridge again, and in July 2023, 'Sea Baby' drones hit two bridge pillars. Today, the occupiers are already accustomed to the hits and air alarms, as evidenced by recent explosions in Feodosia, where a oil terminal was blown up. The terminal is still burning, and the enemy's air defenses have been drawn to protect the bridge from a third explosion,' Golobutsky believes. The analyst emphasizes that the explosion showed that the battle for the Black Sea can be won with creative and technological solutions. 'The operation was developed and implemented by the head of the SBU, Vasyl Malyuk, with several employees of the Service. He personally participated in the design and implementation of the special operation. Interestingly, the bridge was blown up on the day after the birthday of the Russian dictator Putin. The explosion demonstrated that Putin's power over the occupied territories is just as vulnerable as the Crimean Bridge he built,' Golobutsky concludes.

**Two Years Ago: Ukraine's Successful Attack on the Crimean Bridge**
Two years ago, on October 8, 2022, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) launched the first attack on the Crimean Bridge, causing a partial collapse of two spans and significant damage to the road surface. Initially, the Russians tried to downplay the incident, but photos and videos from the scene quickly revealed the extent of the damage. The SBU press service recalled the successful operation, which was personally developed and implemented by SBU head Vasyl Maluk. 'October 8, 2022, will forever be etched in the history of our struggle. It was then that the SBU, as a result of a complex multi-level operation, delivered the first powerful blow to the 'symbol of Kremlin propaganda' - the Crimean Bridge. This bright explosion was a true celebration for all Ukrainians and a slap in the face to Putin's 70th birthday,' the statement reads. The explosive devices were disguised as rolls of tape and had a TNT equivalent of almost 21 tons. After the successful attack, the SBU targeted many other important objects in Russia and continues to do so. The Crimean Bridge, which was previously the main logistics artery for supplying military equipment and fuel to southern Ukraine, was severely damaged and lost its importance. The powerful explosion also caused panic and chaos among the occupiers, who began to flee Crimea in large numbers. It is worth noting that the first explosion on the Crimean Bridge occurred on October 8, 2022, due to the detonation of an explosive device in a truck moving to Crimea from Russian territory. Initially, Russian social media reported that the explosion occurred on a railway line and was caused by a fire in a cargo wagon, which was being transported from Tamansk (Krasnodar Krai) to Kerch. The Kremlin immediately issued a manual to local journalists, instructing them to downplay the incident and omit certain details. After the explosion, Russian social media users went into a frenzy, accusing the authorities of lying and recalling past memes about explosions on military objects in occupied Crimea, including a Russian woman who...

**Ukraine's Successful Attack on the Crimean Bridge: A Blow to Putin's Propaganda**
The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) successfully attacked the Crimean Bridge on October 8, 2022, dealing a significant blow to the Kremlin's propaganda and disrupting the supply of military equipment and fuel to the occupied south of Ukraine. The SBU press service recalled the successful operation, saying, 'This bright explosion was a real celebration for all Ukrainians and a slap in the face to Putin's 70th birthday. Since then, the bridge has ceased to be a main logistical artery for the enemy's supply of military equipment and fuel to the south of Ukraine. And most importantly, the explosion sowed panic and chaos among the occupiers, who began to massively flee from Crimea for the first time.' The attack caused a massive panic among the population, with long queues forming in stores and products being quickly cleared from shelves. Some Russians even fled the peninsula as far as possible. The successful operation also sparked a lively reaction among Ukrainians, with Monobank releasing a new design for their cards and Ukrposhta promising to release a new stamp dedicated to the event.

**Crimean Bridge 'priority target' for British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles - Naryshkin  --  RT Russia & Former Soviet Union**
Russia's Foreign Intelligence Agency (SVR) head, Sergey Naryshkin, has stated that the Crimean Bridge remains a top priority target for Ukraine in its attacks on the peninsula using Western-supplied weapons. Naryshkin noted that Ukraine has been using British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles, as well as American-made ATACMS missiles, to attack the peninsula. He also recalled that CIA Director William Burns had previously stated that Washington's military aid to Ukraine is meant to enable Kiev to 'inflict tangible damage on Russia,' including 'penetrating strikes on Crimea.' Naryshkin said, 'Burns thus voiced the old Anglo-Saxon maxim - to cut off Russia's access to the 'warm sea' at all costs.' The Crimean Bridge has been targeted numerous times since the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, with most attacks being repelled, but a blast in October 2022 and a drone boat attack in July 2023 caused significant damage and loss of life.

**Crimean Bridge Remains Top Priority Target for Ukraine, Says Naryshkin**
The Crimean Bridge remains a top priority target for the Ukrainian regime, said Sergey Naryshkin, director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service. According to Naryshkin, the UK's use of Storm Shadow missiles to attack the bridge is a manifestation of the old Anglo-Saxon maxim 'to cut Russia off from the 'warm seas'. Naryshkin pointed out that Ukrainian attacks on Crimea, carried out with Western arms and space reconnaissance and guidance systems, continue unabated. Crimea's leader, Sergey Aksyonov, previously stated that the effectiveness of the Crimean Bridge's defense against air and sea attacks from the Ukrainian military is nearly 100%, and the object is currently not under threat. The first attack on the Crimean Bridge occurred on October 8, 2022, when a truck exploded on the road section of the bridge, causing a fire on seven fuel tanks of a railway car and partial collapse of two road sections. Four people died in the blast. The FSB stated that the Ukrainian authorities were behind the attack, but the SBU refused to comment on the allegations. Later, SBU head Vasyl Malyuk claimed personal involvement in planning and executing the terrorist act. The second attack on the Crimean Bridge occurred on July 17, 2023, when two unmanned surface vessels struck the bridge. The blast killed a family of two from the Belgorod region and injured their 14-year-old daughter. The explosion damaged the road section of the bridge. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the attack a terrorist act and a senseless crime, stating that the bridge had not been used for military cargo transport for a long time. The bridge was reopened for traffic in a reverse mode the night after the attack. On September 14, the left section of the bridge was opened for car traffic a day ahead of schedule. By October, the Crimean Bridge was fully restored and all four lanes of the transport crossing were opened for traffic. During this time, the damaged sections were dismantled and new ones were installed.

**Ukrainian Forces Strike Major Russian Target in Crimea**
Ukrainian forces struck a major Russian-occupied target in Crimea, hitting the Fedyukhin oil terminal in Feodosiya. The attack caused a fire in the area, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The terminal is the largest in Crimea, handling significant volumes of oil products, including those used to supply the Russian occupation forces. 'The task was accomplished by units of the Rocket Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in cooperation with other components of the Ukrainian Defense Forces. Efforts to undermine the military-economic potential of the Russian Federation continue,' the General Staff said. The attack is the latest in a series of strikes on the terminal, which was also hit in March 2024, December 2023, and November 2023. The incident comes as Russia has increased security measures around the Kerch Strait Bridge, including the installation of new barriers and anti-aircraft missile systems. Ukrainian partisans claim that the Russians are afraid of a Ukrainian landing operation and are fortifying their positions, while a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Andriy Yusov, stated that a plan to destroy the bridge and retake Crimea has been developed, sparking a storm in the Russian information space.

**Explosions Reported in Zaporizhzhia**
Explosions were reported in Zaporizhzhia, according to a Telegram message from TSN. The Russian military began targeting Ukraine's infrastructure on October 10, 2022, two days after the attack on the Crimean Bridge, which Russian authorities blame on Ukrainian special services. The attacks have been ongoing, targeting energy, defense industry, military management, and communication infrastructure across the country. Air raid alerts are issued daily in Ukrainian regions, sometimes nationwide. However, Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov has stated that Russian forces do not target residential homes or social infrastructure in battles with the Ukrainian military.

**Russia Prepares for Unprecedented Attack on Crimean Bridge**
Russia is preparing for an unprecedented attack on the Crimean Bridge, according to 'Crimean Wind'. New satellite images show a significant increase in defensive structures around the bridge. 'Russia has been placing barges on the southern side of the bridge since early May to protect the structure and the waterway from future Ukrainian attacks,' says the monitoring channel. The defensive measures have been strengthened with additional barges and floating boom barriers, which are located parallel to the bridge. However, new images taken on September 29 show a significant increase in the number of barges protecting the bridge, as well as two 'Pantsir' air defense systems near the bridge. This suggests that Russia is concerned not only with the threat from the sea, but also with protecting the bridge from air attacks. The Crimean Bridge is considered an illegal structure, and Ukraine has considered it a legitimate target for attacks. Ukrainian forces have already struck the bridge twice, on October 8, 2022, and July 17, 2023. The Guardian reported in April 2024 that the Ukrainian military was preparing a third attack on the bridge.

**Russia Builds Unknown Defensive Structure Near Crimean Bridge**
Russian occupiers are building an unknown defensive structure near the Crimean Bridge. This is not the first time they have attempted to do so, but they have faced difficulties due to harsh weather conditions. According to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Navy, Dmitry Pletenchuk, 'It will become clear what this is when they complete the construction. But this season, it's unlikely they will be able to finish it, as the stormy period is starting, and building in such conditions will be very difficult. It could be a defensive structure or another crossing - it's too early to make conclusions.' Pletenchuk noted that the Russians have repeatedly attempted to build defensive structures for the Kerch Strait Bridge, but have always failed due to harsh weather conditions. 'We'll see how they will pass this period, which starts in the fall and ends in the spring. They constantly try to place something new in the Kerch Strait, build various hydraulic or barrier structures. But periodically, they end up on the shore after another storm.' The Crimean Bridge has been a target for Ukrainian military forces, with successful attacks on October 8, 2022, and July 17, 2023. The Ukrainian military has stated that the bridge is a legitimate target. Additionally, the Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) is reportedly preparing a third strike on the Crimean Bridge.

**Russia Installs Air Defense Systems Near Crimean Bridge**
Russian occupiers are installing air defense systems near the Crimean Bridge, according to the 'Center for Investigative Journalism'. Two metal towers with 'Pantsir-S1M' anti-aircraft missile and gun systems have been installed on the island of Tuzla, on both sides of the bridge. The systems are designed to protect the Kerch Strait Bridge. The Center for Investigative Journalism noted that they first spotted 'Pantsir' on the Crimean Bridge in early September. The 'Pantsir' system is an export version of the air defense system with a armored cabin installed on a KamAZ-53958 chassis, painted in desert camouflage. The system has increased range and altitude capabilities. A dozen similar sections were also spotted on the construction site near Kerch. Additionally, the Russian occupiers are installing metal 'fences' in the sea, allegedly to protect against sea drone attacks. The context is that Russia occupied Crimea after a military blockade and a disputed referendum in March 2014. Ukraine does not recognize the annexation of the peninsula. The Crimean Bridge, connecting Crimea to Russia, was built after the occupation and opened in 2018 for cars and in 2019-2020 for trains. The bridge has been attacked twice, with the first explosion occurring on October 8, 2022, and the second on July 17, 2023. Ukrainian special services are believed to be behind the attacks. In March 2024, the head of the SBU, Vasyl Malyuk, stated that Ukraine has the potential to completely destroy the Crimean Bridge, but Russia is not currently using it to transport weapons and ammunition. The head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Kirill Budanov, believes that the ATACMS long-range missiles provided by the US could destroy the bridge, 'the question is just how many'. The Crimean Bridge should be destroyed as part of the 'desacralization of Crimea', said the head of the military intelligence and suggested that this could happen before the end of the year. Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly stated that they intend to de-occupy all Ukrainian territories seized by Russia since 2014, including Crimea. President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that liberating the peninsula will be easier than the Donbas region.

Russian occupiers are installing air defense systems near the Crimean Bridge. According to the 'Center for Investigative Journalism', two metal towers with 'Pantsir-S1M' anti-aircraft missile and gun systems have been installed on the island of Tuzla, near the bridge. The towers are 35 meters high and have combat modules on top. This is the first time that 'Pantsir' has been spotted on the Crimean Bridge, which was first noticed at the beginning of September. The system is an export version with a armored cabin, mounted on a KamAZ-53958 chassis, and has increased range and altitude capabilities.

The context is that Russia occupied Crimea after a military blockade and an illegal referendum in 2014. The Crimean Bridge, which connects Crimea to Russia, was built after the occupation and has been the target of two explosions, one in 2022 and another in 2023, which were carried out by Ukrainian special services.

**Grozev: Destruction of the Crimean Bridge is Likely**
Bulgarian investigative journalist Hristo Grozev believes it is likely that the Crimean Bridge, built by Russia, will be destroyed. He stated, 'I consider it likely, not just possible. And when I wake up in the morning, I check Telegram channels, expecting it to happen soon. Especially since Western partners have openly said that it would be an absolutely legitimate military operation for Ukraine, and there are no moral or ethical barriers to using the weapons provided by the West for this purpose.' Grozev emphasized that Crimea is Ukrainian territory, and Ukraine has the right to reclaim it by any means necessary. He added, 'It's obvious that [Ukraine will strike the bridge] at the moment when the enemy is in a disadvantageous position. If the Kursk initiative remains at least at the same level as it is now for another month, I think it means that the enemy is at its lowest point of ability to defend Crimea. And it's likely that we will see something interesting then.' The Crimean Bridge, connecting Crimea to Russia, was built by Russia after the occupation of the peninsula in 2015. The road bridge was opened in 2018, and the railway bridge in 2019-2020. During the full-scale war, the Crimean Bridge was targeted by Ukraine twice, with the first explosion occurring on October 8, 2022, and the second on July 17, 2023. Ukrainian intelligence services were behind the attacks.
