2024-11-16 13:00:27,653 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30124:
To forecast if Cruise will operate a rider-only ride-hailing service anywhere in the United States by December 31, 2024, we'll start by breaking this down into sub-problems and examining various factors:

1. **Historical Context and Reference Class**: Historically, the development of autonomous ride-hailing services has faced technical, regulatory, and safety challenges. The base rate of companies reaching full deployment of rider-only services across the U.S. is low due to these barriers.

2. **Current Status of Cruise**: Cruise has faced significant setbacks, including the suspension of its driverless operations nationwide due to safety concerns from California regulators. While the company is working to improve safety and regain trust, the pace at which these issues can be resolved is uncertain.

3. **Comparison with Competitors**: Waymo, a competitor, is successfully expanding its services in multiple U.S. cities and has received strong funding and regulatory support, which implies that a company can overcome these hurdles with the right conditions. However, Cruise's current position is significantly less favorable due to its recent history and need for regulatory approval.

4. **Technological and Regulatory Challenges**: Regulatory obstacles are crucial. Cruise must not only resolve its safety concerns but also secure permits in various jurisdictions, a process that can be lengthy and unpredictable.

5. **Recent Developments and News Articles**: Our review of recent articles indicates Cruise is focused on re-establishing its operations and improving safety. However, there isn't concrete evidence of rapid progress towards a full rider-only service restart.

6. **Probability Adjustments**: Given the setbacks, resolving technological and regulatory issues by the end of 2024 is ambitious. Even if testing resumes, transitioning to a fully operational rider-only service for the general public by December 2024 is uncertain within this timeframe.

7. **Inside vs. Outside View Balancing**: The inside view looks at Cruise's specific challenges while the outside view considers the broader industry progression, with Waymo as an example of success under different conditions. Both views suggest significant hurdles remain for Cruise.

8. **Relative Evidence Weighting**: The most compelling argument against a 'Yes' resolution is the regulatory and safety compliance issues Cruise is facing. Compounding this with the general complexity of developing a safe, autonomous vehicle network using historical trends of technological deployment pacing, delivering a functioning service by next year remains challenging.

Upon weighing these factors, I estimate the probability that Cruise will operate a rider-only ride-hailing service anywhere in the U.S. by December 31, 2024, as follows:

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

2024-11-16 13:00:27,657 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30124:
Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence Against (lowering probability):
1. Cruise suspended all driverless operations nationwide in October 2023 due to safety concerns and regulatory action
2. California DMV revoked Cruise's permit citing "unreasonable risk to public safety"
3. NHTSA is investigating multiple crash reports involving hard braking incidents
4. Most recent news from September 2024 indicates Cruise is only planning to re-launch supervised testing with safety drivers
5. The company hasn't been generating revenue since halting operations
6. Rebuilding regulatory trust and addressing safety concerns takes considerable time

Key Evidence For (raising probability):
1. GM/Cruise has announced plans to resume testing in California
2. They have already deployed manual mapping vehicles in Sunnyvale and Mountain View
3. The company aims to resume supervised testing with five autonomous vehicles
4. Cruise previously stated goals to begin fully autonomous operations by end of 2024
5. Strong financial backing from GM and previous operational experience

Analysis:
1. Timeline is very tight - only about 6 weeks remain until December 31, 2024
2. The latest news suggests Cruise is still in early testing phases with safety drivers
3. No indication of imminent regulatory approval for rider-only service
4. Competitor Waymo is actively expanding while Cruise is still rebuilding
5. The requirement for "available to general public" (not just testing) makes this especially challenging

The combination of:
- Recent severe regulatory setbacks
- Need for extensive testing and safety validation
- Short remaining timeline
- Requirement for full public availability
- Conservative regulatory environment

Makes it highly unlikely Cruise will achieve rider-only public service by December 31, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 5.20% and 15.30%, with 8.50% being the most likely. Probability: 8.50%

To assess the probability of Cruise operating a rider-only ride-hailing service by December 31, 2024, I will explore the available information and apply the superforecasting principles.

### Reference Class and Base Rate

1. **Reference Class:** The most relevant reference classes include other companies attempting to deploy autonomous ride-hailing services, particularly Waymo and Tesla. Given Cruise's recent operational hiatus following regulatory challenges, comparing its situation to those of competitors who faced similar hurdles is insightful.

2. **Base Rate:** The base rate of companies overcoming regulatory challenges and achieving operational autonomous ride-hailing services provides a benchmark. For instance, Waymo and Tesla have displayed varied timelines from testing to public operation.

### Sub-Problems

- **Regulatory Challenges:** Cruise has faced significant regulatory barriers due to safety incidents, resulting in the suspension of operations. These issues are a critical obstacle, and the timeline for overcoming them is uncertain.
  
- **Technological Readiness:** Whether Cruise can address the technological deficiencies that led to accidents and resume testing and operations is paramount. The company's ability to test and demonstrate improved safety over the next year will influence the probability of public operations by year-end 2024.

- **Market Competition:** Competitors like Waymo and Tesla are advancing their autonomous services, exerting competitive pressure. This could motivate expedited progress for Cruise, but it also highlights a crowded and challenging field.

### Clashing Causal Forces

- **Positive Forces:** The potential for lucrative market opportunities fueling investments and technological development; regulatory approval if safety is improved.
  
- **Negative Forces:** Public and regulatory skepticism heightened by recent accidents, coupled with heightened competition and technical hurdles.

### Current Trends and Evidence

- Cruise is in a rebuilding phase after the suspension, and resuming operationsâ€”both testing and commercialâ€”requires satisfying both technological improvements and regulatory approval. The timeline is tight, referencing similar cases that took months to years to overcome such hurdles.

### Degrees of Doubt and Confidence

Given the regulatory setbacks and the necessary time for rebuilding trust, testing, and achieving full approval, there is significant uncertainty. However, there remains potential for rapid progress if obstacles are overcome efficiently, as demonstrated by competitors.

### Balancing Errors and Confidence

- **Risk of Overconfidence:** Assuming swift resolution of regulatory and technological issues may be overly optimistic without considerable evidence of immediate improvements.
  
- **Risk of Underconfidence:** Discounting the potential for Cruise to address issues sufficiently to resume limited operations might overlook the urgency and resources available for problem resolution in the industry.

Based on these considerations, I assess the chance of Cruise operating rider-only autonomous services by December 31, 2024, as follows:

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

2024-11-16 13:00:44,240 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30124:
Let me analyze this question systematically:

1. Reference Class/Base Rate:
- Cruise previously operated autonomous vehicles but had to suspend operations in October 2023 due to safety concerns
- Other companies like Waymo are successfully operating in multiple cities
- The timeline to December 31, 2024 gives about 13 months for Cruise to restart operations

2. Key Evidence FOR a restart by Dec 31, 2024:
- According to September 2024 news, Cruise has already begun re-launching autonomous tests in California
- They've deployed manual mapping vehicles in Sunnyvale and Mountain View
- The company aims to restart supervised testing with five autonomous vehicles
- Cruise has stated intentions to begin fully autonomous operations by end of 2024

3. Key Evidence AGAINST a restart by Dec 31, 2024:
- Cruise lost its permit due to serious safety concerns and misleading regulators
- NHTSA investigation into safety issues is ongoing
- Recent news (October/November 2024) focuses more on Waymo's expansion than Cruise's return
- The company needs to rebuild public and regulatory trust
- Current testing is still in supervised mode

4. Analysis of Timeline:
- From September to December 2024 is a relatively short window
- Moving from supervised testing to full rider-only service requires multiple regulatory approvals
- Past incidents suggest regulators will be extra cautious

5. Distinctive Features:
- Cruise has significant backing from GM
- They have experience operating such services before
- But regulatory hurdles are higher after previous issues

6. Error Balancing:
- Risk of being too optimistic given previous setbacks
- Need to account for regulatory caution
- But also consider company's resources and experience

Given the short timeline, ongoing investigations, and need to rebuild trust, combined with the specific requirement for "rider-only" service available to the "general public" by December 31, 2024, the probability appears low.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, with 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

2024-11-16 13:01:01,243 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30124:
To forecast the likelihood of Cruise operating a rider-only ride-hailing service in the United States by December 31, 2024, we'll follow a structured approach.

**1. Reference Classes and Base Rates:**

First, let's consider the broader context of autonomous vehicle (AV) deployment. Generally, the deployment of commercial AV services has been slow due to regulatory challenges, technological hurdles, and safety concerns. Even though there are examples of companies like Waymo that have made progress, these are exceptions rather than the norm, particularly in such a highly regulated environment.

**2. Latest News and Current Situation:**

From the recent information, Cruise is facing significant challenges, having suspended driverless operations across the nation due to regulatory scrutiny and safety issues. This suspension is a considerable setback, especially with investigations from key regulatory bodies like California DMV and NHTSA ongoing. The company's stated intention is to rebuild trust, which implies a potentially lengthy process before resuming operations, let alone expanding them.

**3. Clashing Causal Forces and Recent Developments:**

On one side, Cruise, as part of GM, has significant resources and a vested interest in restarting its operations, aligning with a broader market push towards automation. However, this is counteracted by the regulatory environment, technical issues with their vehicles, and the need to address public safety concerns comprehensively. Given the timeline and the complexity of these issues, it would be ambitious for Cruise to resolve them and launch a rider-only service available to the general public by the end of 2024.

**4. Balance Between Inside and Outside Views:**

The inside view considers Cruise's unique situation, setbacks, and plans for recovery. The outside view looks at the broader trends and base rates for AV deployment, regulatory hurdles, and comparisons with competitors like Waymo who have managed to operationalize but after prolonged development and testing phases.

**5. Past Forecasting and Relevant Perspectives:**

Historically, forecasts from platforms like Metaculus and others often overestimate the speed of technological and regulatory change. In this case, the multiple regulatory issues Cruise faces suggest delays.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the current landscape, considering the regulatory, technological challenges, and the absence of any clear indications that Cruise can resolve these quickly enough to meet the resolution criteria by December 31, 2024, I assess a lower probability for Cruise's rider-only service being operational to the general public in the U.S. by that date.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

From the recent information, Cruise is facing significant challenges, having suspended driverless operations across the nation due to regulatory scrutiny and safety issues. This suspension is a considerable setback, especially with investigations from key regulatory bodies like California DMV and NHTSA ongoing. The company's stated intention is to rebuild trust, which implies a potentially lengthy process before resuming operations, let alone expanding them.

**3. Clashing Causal Forces and Recent Developments:**

On one side, Cruise, as part of GM, has significant resources and a vested interest in restarting its operations, aligning with a broader market push towards automation. However, this is counteracted by the regulatory environment, technical issues with their vehicles, and the need to address public safety concerns comprehensively. Given the timeline and the complexity of these issues, it would be ambitious for Cruise to resolve them and launch a rider-only service available to the general public by the end of 2024.

**4. Balance Between Inside and Outside Views:**

The inside view considers Cruise's unique situation, setbacks, and plans for recovery. The outside view looks at the broader trends and base rates for AV deployment, regulatory hurdles, and comparisons with competitors like Waymo who have managed to operationalize but after prolonged development and testing phases.

**5. Past Forecasting and Relevant Perspectives:**

Historically, forecasts from platforms like Metaculus and others often overestimate the speed of technological and regulatory change. In this case, the multiple regulatory issues Cruise faces suggest delays.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the current landscape, considering the regulatory, technological challenges, and the absence of any clear indications that Cruise can resolve these quickly enough to meet the resolution criteria by December 31, 2024, I assess a lower probability for Cruise's rider-only service being operational to the general public in the U.S. by that date.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

2024-11-16 13:01:17,393 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30124:
To forecast whether Cruise will operate a rider-only ride-hailing service anywhere in the United States by December 31, 2024, let's evaluate the available information and apply superforecasting principles:

1. **Reference and Base Rates:**
   - Historically, launching autonomous ride-hailing services has been fraught with regulatory hurdles, safety concerns, and technological challenges. Companies like Waymo have faced long development cycles with incremental progress.
   - Cruise has previously faced significant setbacks, including suspension of operations by regulators due to safety issues. Given this recent history, the base rate for successfully overcoming such challenges within a short time frame is relatively low.

2. **Trends and Current Status:**
   - As of the latest updates, Cruise has been allowed to resume testing but remains under scrutiny from multiple regulatory bodies. The company needs to rebuild trust and ensure the safety of its autonomous systems.
   - Waymo's recent expansion suggests progress in driverless technology, but it indicates industry competition rather than a direct influence on Cruise's timelines.

3. **Causal Forces:**
   - **For Cruise:**
     - Positive factors: Progress in technology and safety improvements could lead to resumption of service.
     - Negative factors: Regulatory barriers, public skepticism, and competition from Waymo and others could hinder rapid deployment.
   - **Against Cruise:**
     - Regulatory environment remains stringent; rebuilding trust and meeting safety standards may take longer than anticipated.

4. **Distinguishing Doubts and Adjustments:**
   - Cruise's consistent regulatory setbacks and the timeline required to address safety and technical issues suggest significant uncertainty. However, industry momentum towards technological development offers moderate optimism.

5. **Probability Assignment:**
   - Given the dissonance between rapid technological progress and current regulatory challenges, the probability that Cruise will resume full rider-only operations by the deadline remains cautious but not impossible.

Balancing the historical patterns, recent news, and regulatory conditions, I lean towards a lower probability of Cruise resuming rider-only operations by December 31, 2024. However, considering potential technological breakthroughs and regulatory decisions, a nontrivial chance exists.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 20.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

   - Cruise has previously faced significant setbacks, including suspension of operations by regulators due to safety issues. Given this recent history, the base rate for successfully overcoming such challenges within a short time frame is relatively low.

2. **Trends and Current Status:**
   - As of the latest updates, Cruise has been allowed to resume testing but remains under scrutiny from multiple regulatory bodies. The company needs to rebuild trust and ensure the safety of its autonomous systems.
   - Waymo's recent expansion suggests progress in driverless technology, but it indicates industry competition rather than a direct influence on Cruise's timelines.

3. **Causal Forces:**
   - **For Cruise:**
     - Positive factors: Progress in technology and safety improvements could lead to resumption of service.
     - Negative factors: Regulatory barriers, public skepticism, and competition from Waymo and others could hinder rapid deployment.
   - **Against Cruise:**
     - Regulatory environment remains stringent; rebuilding trust and meeting safety standards may take longer than anticipated.

4. **Distinguishing Doubts and Adjustments:**
   - Cruise's consistent regulatory setbacks and the timeline required to address safety and technical issues suggest significant uncertainty. However, industry momentum towards technological development offers moderate optimism.

5. **Probability Assignment:**
   - Given the dissonance between rapid technological progress and current regulatory challenges, the probability that Cruise will resume full rider-only operations by the deadline remains cautious but not impossible.

Balancing the historical patterns, recent news, and regulatory conditions, I lean towards a lower probability of Cruise resuming rider-only operations by December 31, 2024. However, considering potential technological breakthroughs and regulatory decisions, a nontrivial chance exists.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 20.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence Against (suggesting low probability):
1. Cruise completely suspended operations in October 2023 after serious safety concerns and regulatory intervention
2. Recent news (October/November 2024) indicates Cruise is still only in testing phase with safety drivers
3. From articles: "GM's Cruise has been working to improve safety after a traffic accident led to a suspension of operations"
4. Cruise is "testing cars with safety drivers" and only aims to "begin fully autonomous robotaxi operations by the end of 2024"
5. The regulatory scrutiny and safety concerns that led to the suspension were significant

Key Evidence For (suggesting higher probability):
1. Articles mention Cruise "aims to begin fully autonomous robotaxi operations by the end of 2024"
2. They have resumed testing in the Bay Area
3. They have a clear timeline for re-launching services
4. The company has strong financial backing from GM

Breaking down the problem:
1. Technical capability: Cruise has demonstrated this before
2. Regulatory approval: This is the biggest hurdle given past issues
3. Timeline: Very tight - only about 6 weeks from current date to deadline
4. Safety record: Need to prove improvements since suspension

The critical factor is the extremely tight timeline between now (November 16, 2024) and December 31, 2024. While Cruise aims to restart operations by year-end, they are currently still in testing phase with safety drivers. Given the previous regulatory issues and the need to rebuild trust, plus the fact that they would need to move from testing to full deployment in just six weeks, the probability seems quite low.

The most comparable reference class would be autonomous vehicle companies recovering from safety incidents - these typically take many months to return to full operation.

My Prediction: Between 5.50% and 15.50%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

2024-11-16 13:01:33,591 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30124:
To forecast whether Cruise will operate a rider-only ride-hailing service anywhere in the United States on December 31, 2024, I'll break down the analysis into several steps:

1. **Reference Class Forecasting:**
   - Autonomous vehicle deployment by companies such as Waymo and Tesla is progressing but has faced substantial regulatory hurdles and safety concerns.
   - Specifically for Cruise, which has had its permit revoked in California and has suspended operations nationwide, the parallel cases of companies attempting to re-launch or expand similar services can provide a reference. For example, Waymo and Tesla have navigated regulatory challenges to expand their services, yet they required a significant amount of time and investment to do so.

2. **Current State and Key Evidence:**
   - Cruise is currently not operating rider-only services and has suspended operations due to regulatory challenges. This is a negative signal because resuming operations usually requires demonstrating safety improvements and regaining regulatory trust, which can be time-consuming.
   - The regulatory environment for autonomous ride-hailing services is stringent, especially in light of public safety concerns. Previous incidents involving Cruise's vehicles have necessitated a comprehensive re-evaluation and resolution before services could resume.
   - Competing companies like Waymo have continued operations and expanded into new markets, showing that recovery and reauthorization are possible but likely require significant time and effort.
   
3. **Distinctive Features and Trends:**
   - While advancements in technology and autonomous driving have been considerable, the major hurdles remain regulatory and safety compliance, heightened after incidents.
   - Cruise's parent company, General Motors, likely has the resources to address these issues, but the timeline by the end of 2024 is challenging given the current situation.
   
4. **Adjusting for Current Evidence and Context:**
   - Considering the time needed to satisfy regulatory bodies following the suspension and the technological adjustments that may be required after the noted safety issues, the timeline to December 31, 2024, appears tight for public re-launches of such services.

5. **Clashing Causal Forces:**
   - On one hand, technological progress supports the feasibility of Cruise overcoming these obstacles over time. On the other hand, the required timeframe for addressing regulatory, safety, and public perception issues is substantial.
   
6. **Probabilistic Forecast:**
   - Taking into account the complete suspension of Cruise operations, the serious nature of regulatory concerns, and the standard timeline for resolving such large-scale operational and regulatory challenges, the probability of Cruise successfully resuming a public rider-only ride-hailing service by the end of 2024 is low.

Based on this analysis, the best estimate is that Cruise will not resume rider-only ride-hailing services by December 31, 2024. Therefore, my prediction is:

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

   - Taking into account the complete suspension of Cruise operations, the serious nature of regulatory concerns, and the standard timeline for resolving such large-scale operational and regulatory challenges, the probability of Cruise successfully resuming a public rider-only ride-hailing service by the end of 2024 is low.

Based on this analysis, the best estimate is that Cruise will not resume rider-only ride-hailing services by December 31, 2024. Therefore, my prediction is:

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.
2024-11-16 13:01:33,591 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30124:
To forecast whether Cruise will operate a rider-only ride-hailing service anywhere in the United States on December 31, 2024, I'll break down the analysis into several steps:

1. **Reference Class Forecasting:**
   - Autonomous vehicle deployment by companies such as Waymo and Tesla is progressing but has faced substantial regulatory hurdles and safety concerns.
   - Specifically for Cruise, which has had its permit revoked in California and has suspended operations nationwide, the parallel cases of companies attempting to re-launch or expand similar services can provide a reference. For example, Waymo and Tesla have navigated regulatory challenges to expand their services, yet they required a significant amount of time and investment to do so.

2. **Current State and Key Evidence:**
   - Cruise is currently not operating rider-only services and has suspended operations due to regulatory challenges. This is a negative signal because resuming operations usually requires demonstrating safety improvements and regaining regulatory trust, which can be time-consuming.
   - The regulatory environment for autonomous ride-hailing services is stringent, especially in light of public safety concerns. Previous incidents involving Cruise's vehicles have necessitated a comprehensive re-evaluation and resolution before services could resume.
   - Competing companies like Waymo have continued operations and expanded into new markets, showing that recovery and reauthorization are possible but likely require significant time and effort.
   
3. **Distinctive Features and Trends:**
   - While advancements in technology and autonomous driving have been considerable, the major hurdles remain regulatory and safety compliance, heightened after incidents.
   - Cruise's parent company, General Motors, likely has the resources to address these issues, but the timeline by the end of 2024 is challenging given the current situation.
   
4. **Adjusting for Current Evidence and Context:**
   - Considering the time needed to satisfy regulatory bodies following the suspension and the technological adjustments that may be required after the noted safety issues, the timeline to December 31, 2024, appears tight for public re-launches of such services.

5. **Clashing Causal Forces:**
   - On one hand, technological progress supports the feasibility of Cruise overcoming these obstacles over time. On the other hand, the required timeframe for addressing regulatory, safety, and public perception issues is substantial.

2024-11-16 13:01:33,598 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30124:
Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence Against (lowering probability):
1. Cruise suspended all driverless operations nationwide in October 2023 following safety concerns and regulatory action in California
2. They lost their permit to operate self-driving vehicles
3. NHTSA is investigating multiple crash reports
4. The most recent news from September 2024 only mentions plans to "re-launch supervised testing of five autonomous vehicles" with safety drivers
5. They need to rebuild public trust and regulatory approval

Key Evidence For (increasing probability):
1. From October 2024 news, GM's Cruise "aims to begin fully autonomous robotaxi operations by the end of 2024"
2. They have already deployed manual mapping vehicles in Sunnyvale and Mountain View
3. They are actively working on re-booting services throughout 2024
4. They have strong financial backing from GM
5. Competitors like Waymo are successfully operating in multiple cities

Timing Analysis:
- We need to predict whether they'll be operational by December 31, 2024
- That's only about 6 weeks from current date (November 16, 2024)
- The timeline seems very tight given they're still in supervised testing phase
- Regulatory approval processes typically take months

Current Status:
- Still in supervised testing phase with safety drivers
- No current rider-only operations
- Need to complete testing, gain regulatory approval, and launch service all within 6 weeks

The extremely short timeframe combined with regulatory hurdles makes this highly unlikely. While Cruise has stated their aim to launch by end of 2024, their current testing status and recent safety issues suggest this is an optimistic timeline.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, with 8.00% being the most likely. Probability: 8.00%

5. They need to rebuild public trust and regulatory approval

Key Evidence For (increasing probability):
1. From October 2024 news, GM's Cruise "aims to begin fully autonomous robotaxi operations by the end of 2024"
2. They have already deployed manual mapping vehicles in Sunnyvale and Mountain View
3. They are actively working on re-booting services throughout 2024
4. They have strong financial backing from GM
5. Competitors like Waymo are successfully operating in multiple cities

Timing Analysis:
- We need to predict whether they'll be operational by December 31, 2024
- That's only about 6 weeks from current date (November 16, 2024)
- The timeline seems very tight given they're still in supervised testing phase
- Regulatory approval processes typically take months

Current Status:
- Still in supervised testing phase with safety drivers
- No current rider-only operations
- Need to complete testing, gain regulatory approval, and launch service all within 6 weeks

The extremely short timeframe combined with regulatory hurdles makes this highly unlikely. While Cruise has stated their aim to launch by end of 2024, their current testing status and recent safety issues suggest this is an optimistic timeline.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, with 8.00% being the most likely. Probability: 8.00%
