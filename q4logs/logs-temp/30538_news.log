**Map shows arctic blast to cause shockingly cold temperatures in every state**
A powerful Arctic blast is forecast to bring unusually cold temperatures to every state in the United States, starting from Wednesday. According to Weather Track US, temperatures could reach 15 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit below average in some areas, with the biggest shifts away from the average temperatures expected in the northern Great Plains and Appalachia. 'We're in for a very significant blast of Arctic/Siberian air later this week and into early December,' the group wrote. Freezing temperatures are anticipated in all states east of the Rockies, with temperatures 10 degrees below average expected in most states. The National Weather Service (NWS) warned that temperatures could plunge as much as 40 degrees below zero when factoring in wind chill this weekend.

**Winter Chaos or a Mild December? Meteorologist Makes First Prediction**
Meteorologist Dominik Jung from wetter.net has made a surprising prediction for the December 2024 weather in Germany. According to Jung, the month will be characterized by a 'dramatic change' in temperature, with cold nights and mild days. While the north will remain cool, the west and south may experience temperatures above 15°C. Jung notes that this 'mixed weather' is typical for a December in a warming world. However, he also warns that sudden cold snaps are still possible. As for a white Christmas, the chances are low, with most of Germany expected to be mild, with highs of up to 12°C. Only in higher elevations may a thin layer of snow be present. Jung concludes that the models show a 'clear trend' towards a mild December, which could be one of the warmest on record.

**Michigan: The Snowiest State in the US, After Alaska**
Contrary to popular opinion, Michigan is the state in the US that receives the most snow in winter, after Alaska. This is due to the 'lake effect', a meteorological phenomenon that occurs when cold air passes over large bodies of warmer water, such as the Great Lakes. Cities like Marquette, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, often record high levels of snow accumulation each winter, with averages of over 300 inches (7.6 meters). The 'lake effect' causes the warm and humid air over the water to rise rapidly, cool and condense, forming clouds that produce intense snowfall as they move towards land. According to a report by the University of Michigan, this phenomenon can produce very localized but intense snowfall, more common in autumn and winter when lake temperatures have not dropped drastically. Areas affected by the 'lake effect' can receive snow accumulations of several feet in a few days, making cities near the Great Lakes some of the snowiest in the US, after Alaska. However, a recent study by Wisevoter found that New Hampshire had the highest average annual snowfall, followed by Maine and Vermont, which surpassed Alaska in 2023. The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that the 2023-2024 winter was 'much warmer than normal', with December and February being warmer than average, and January being colder. Snowfall was also below normal, with most areas receiving 0.5 to 3 inches, except for a corridor in southern Illinois, which received 4 to 7 inches due to a strong storm on February 16, 2024.

**NOAA releases new outlook for winter 2024-25. What it means for Chicago area**
The National Weather Service has released an updated winter outlook for December through February, predicting a 'weak' La Niña pattern. According to the Climate Prediction Center, La Niña is expected to develop and last through winter, which could lead to a wetter winter with more numerous storm systems moving across the Great Lakes region. However, temperatures are more difficult to predict, with an equal chance of being above or below average. Historically, La Niña winters have been mixed, with five colder-than-normal, six warmer-than-normal, and three near-normal winters in Chicago since 1996. The average snowfall is 38.4 inches, but Chicago only had around 20 inches in the past two years, making it likely that this winter will be wetter than average but not as mild as the past few winters. As noted by the National Weather Service, 'it's likely not going to be as mild as the past few winters have been in Chicago.'

**Chicago Thanksgiving weather: chilly and possibly wet**
Chicagoans can expect a chilly Thanksgiving holiday weekend with a chance of rain or snow overnight on Wednesday. Temperatures on Thanksgiving Day are predicted to be in the upper 30s, with a high of 40 degrees Fahrenheit. National Weather Service meteorologist Ricky Castro said, 'It's a little too early to say' whether there will be precipitation, but there is 'pretty high confidence' that it will be a colder pattern. The week of Thanksgiving will bring a 'return to colder conditions' after milder weather in the low 50s on Sunday. A cold front is expected to come through the Chicago area on Monday, bringing a chilly air mass into the region. After the holiday weekend, Castro said that a 'pretty cold start to December' appears likely, with even colder air coming into the region. This could bring 'occasional chances for accumulating snow,' with Thursday's snowfall being the season's first 'wake-up call that we're in Northern Illinois.'

**Strong Storm System to Bring Intense Snowfall to Western US and Chicago**
A strong storm system is expected to bring intense snowfall to Oregon, California, and Chicago, Illinois, in the coming days. The precipitation will start as rain, but could turn into a mix of sleet and snow at night. Although significant accumulations are not expected, the event marks the beginning of a winter season that typically starts in Chicago around late October. Historically, the latest first snowfall in Chicago occurred on December 5, 1999, making this week's event one of the latest starts in recent decades. The weather forecast also suggests another storm system could hit the western United States by the end of next week, with additional snowfall accumulations estimated between 25 and 50 centimeters in some ski resorts. This pattern indicates intense winter activity in the short term, benefiting mountain tourism centers preparing for the ski season. The combined system, along with current events, not only provides a boost to local economies dependent on winter tourism, but also warns of hazardous road and mountain trail conditions.

**Winter 2024: Countries to be Covered by Snow and Reach Freezing Temperatures**
The National Center for Atmospheric Prediction (CPC) expects a 60% chance of a phenomenon called 'nina' to occur in the United States from December 2024 to February 2025, which can cause significant temperature fluctuations and precipitation in the upper Mississippi River Valley. The CPC also predicts that the phenomenon of 'nina' will continue until March 2025, making it more likely for the world to experience colder temperatures than usual. The CPC notes that the shift from the 'nino' phenomenon to the 'nina' phenomenon will bring changes to the global climate, with some regions experiencing more variability than others. In the United States, 17 states have been issued winter weather warnings, with parts of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, and South Dakota expected to experience cold temperatures. Heavy snowfall is expected in the Oregon Cascades, with up to 2 feet of snow, and 15-18 inches of snow in the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming and the Colorado Mountains. Temperatures are expected to drop below freezing in areas affected by freeze warnings, with temperatures reaching as low as 21°F in parts of New Mexico and 22-23°F in parts of Colorado.

**Chicago's First Snowfall Delayed: Unusual Warmth Continues**
Chicago is experiencing an unusually warm fall, which has delayed the first snowfall of the season. Typically, the city sees its first snowfall before November, but this year's warm temperatures have pushed back the event. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the city has not yet experienced its first measurable snowfall this year, and the warm weather may continue to delay the event. The NWS predicts a 70-80% chance of above-average temperatures in Illinois, including Chicago, from November 14-22, which reduces the likelihood of snow in the next few weeks. The last time Chicago took this long to register its first snowfall was in 1999, when the first snowfall occurred on December 5. The city's last significant snowfall was on December 28, 2021, three days after Christmas. The warm temperatures for November are also unusual, with highs expected to reach 16°C (61°F) in some areas, which is uncommon for this time of year. While this warm trend may reduce the chances of snow, it does not rule it out. An increase in precipitation is projected for late November, which could bring a rapid drop in temperatures and the first snowfall. However, the type of precipitation will depend on how temperatures fluctuate in the coming weeks. The NWS indicates that Chicago has a higher probability of experiencing rain than snow in the short term.

**Illinois to Expect Abundant Snow this Winter, with Variable Climate Conditions**
According to AccuWeather, this winter in Illinois will be much snowier than last year. The company predicts that the Chicago area could see significant snowfall, exceeding the amounts recorded in the past season. However, this winter may also bring warmer temperatures than usual, with lower heating demands in the northern part of the state. The snowfall accumulations, ranging from 76 to 114 cm, would surpass the 56.3 cm that fell in the 2023-2024 winter. Paul Pastelok, AccuWeather meteorologist, noted that the La Niña phenomenon, although present, will be weak, allowing other factors to influence the climate pattern, resulting in more variability during the winter. A polar vortex could bring cold air in February, but it's uncertain if it will reach the continental United States. The forecast also indicates that several cities in the northeastern and midwestern United States, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, will see more snow than last winter, potentially reaching near-historical averages. Additionally, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan may experience a significant increase in snowfall. The climate variability in the 2024-2025 season is expected to bring periods of snow and intense cold, but also warmer air from the Pacific in early 2025, which could reduce snowfall and alter the climate in some areas. Pastelok warned about the risk of severe storms during the winter, which could affect states further north, such as Missouri, Arkansas, and Tennessee, while the risk of severe storms would increase along the Gulf of Mexico coast in February.

**A La Niña winter is expected, scientists say. Here’s what it means for snow and temps in Chicago.**
Scientists predict a La Niña winter for most of the country, including Chicago and Illinois, which may bring a colder and wetter winter. According to the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center, there's a 60% chance of La Niña emerging between September to November, with the expectation that it will continue through March. Illinois state climatologist Trent Ford cautioned that there's a lot of variability between La Niña years, and other weather patterns can affect the outcome. However, he noted that La Niña can cause a 'more northerly storm track' in the winter months, leading to colder and wetter conditions in the northern part of the continental U.S. Ford said there's a strong chance that Chicago will be wetter than normal from December through February, with a tendency for more cold outbreaks during La Niña winters. However, he also noted that there's a long-term warming trend in the region due to climate change, and that this La Niña is 'moderate' or 'medium strength.'

**A La Niña winter is expected, scientists say; here's what it means for snow and temps in Chicago**
Scientists predict a La Niña winter for the United States, which may bring a colder and wetter winter to Chicago and the rest of Illinois. According to the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center, there's a 60% chance of La Niña emerging between September to November, with the expectation that it will continue through March. Trent Ford, the Illinois state climatologist, cautioned that 'there's a lot of variability between La Niña years,' and that other weather patterns can affect the outcome. La Niña can cause a 'more northerly storm track' in the winter months, leading to colder and wetter conditions in the northern part of the continental U.S. Ford said that Chicago may be wetter than normal from December through February, with a strong chance of cold outbreaks and possibly more chances for heavier snow. However, he noted that there's a big caveat to these predictions, as lots of other events can affect the weather, including sea ice in the Arctic and Eurasian snow cover. 'Unfortunately, after a brief period in the spring of 2024 with minimal drought conditions across the country, more than a quarter of the land mass in the continental U.S. is currently in at least a moderate drought,' said Brad Pugh, operational drought lead with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center. 'And the winter precipitation outlook does not bode well for widespread relief.'

**How cold, snowy could Chicago's winter be? Latest winter weather predictions**
According to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) latest winter weather outlook for 2024-25, a 'La Niña' winter is expected, which would result in a 'wetter than normal' winter in the Great Lakes, especially in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. Kevin Jeanes, a meteorologist, said that this would be beneficial as the region has been experiencing a moderate drought. The winter precipitation outlook for the Chicago area is expected to be above average, with 18.5 inches of snow recorded during the 2023-24 meteorological winter, 11.1 inches below normal. However, the big question is whether temperatures will cause precipitation to fall in the form of rain or snow. Jeanes noted that it could be colder than last year, but only compared to the extremely warm temperatures recorded in 2023-24. NOAA predicts 'equal chances' of temperatures being above or below average. A much colder winter is expected across the Northwest, while a La Niña event typically leads to cooler springs if the pattern persists. According to the Climate Prediction Center, La Niña is favored to emerge between September and November and is expected to persist through the winter months.

**Chicago Prepares for First Snows of Winter**
Temperatures in Illinois, USA, are dropping, and frost warnings are being issued in Chicago. While immediate forecasts do not predict snow, the city is preparing for the first signs of winter. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the first light snows typically occur by the end of October, marking the beginning of winter. Estimated snowfall dates are as follows: light snows (less than 2.54 cm) are expected on average by October 31, significant snowfall (2.54 cm or more) is expected to occur from November 18, and snowfall of one inch or more is expected on December 7. However, it is possible that snow could occur earlier. This winter may be influenced by La Niña, a weather pattern that could lead to a 'wetter-than-normal' winter, especially in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the La Niña event is expected to strengthen during the winter months. This forecast also predicts that more storm systems will hit the Chicago area, with a 50/50 chance of precipitation being rain or snow. However, the University of Illinois notes that stronger La Niña patterns can produce winters that are 'warmer and wetter than average', with more snow and winter storms during those seasons.

**How will winter be in Illinois: the amount of snow that will fall in the prairie state**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its winter climate forecast for 2024-25. The winter season in Illinois is expected to be influenced by the 'La Niña' climate phenomenon, which is characterized by the cooling of Pacific Ocean waters. This may lead to some unexpected weather patterns in the state. The NOAA indicates that the 'La Niña' pattern is expected to strengthen during the winter season, which runs from December 1 to February 28, and may direct the prevailing jet stream more to the north, leading to more storm systems hitting the Chicago area. According to AccuWeather, Chicago is expected to receive between 76 and 114 cm of snow this winter, which is significantly more than the 56.4 cm received in 2023 and even exceeds the average of the past decade, which was 97.5 cm. AccuWeather's meteorologist, Paul Pastelok, notes that a less intense 'La Niña' allows other climate variables to take center stage, which could result in a more variable winter. In Chicago, this could mean warmer-than-usual temperatures and less heating demand in the northern half of the state. Although there is a possibility of a polar vortex in February, the certainty of its arrival is low. This could influence the appearance of intense cold air in the United States. The University of Illinois notes that stronger 'La Niña' patterns tend to produce winters that are 'warmer and wetter than average,' with more snow and winter storms during those seasons.

**When Is The Best Time To Visit Alaska?**
Alaska is a year-round destination for travelers, with each season offering unique experiences and activities. Winter (December - February) is perfect for snow sports and witnessing the Northern Lights, while spring (March - May) is ideal for exploring Alaska's wild beauty without crowds. Summer (June - August) is the peak tourism season, with long days and mild temperatures, ideal for outdoor adventures like hiking, fishing, and kayaking. Fall (September - November) is a quieter time, but still stunning, with autumn colors and excellent wildlife viewing opportunities. Alaska's diverse landscapes and activities make it a top destination at any time of the year, with festivals and events like the Anchorage Fur Rendezvous and the Sitka Whalefest.

**NOAA Releases Winter Weather Forecast for Chicago Area**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its winter weather forecast for the Chicago area, and residents may need to prepare for what's to come. According to NOAA officials, a 'slow-developing' La Niña event in the Pacific Ocean will likely strengthen the dominant weather pattern in the Great Lakes, resulting in a 'wetter-than-normal' winter, especially in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. The La Niña pattern is expected to intensify during the meteorological winter, which runs from December 1 to February 28, and will likely direct the prevailing jet stream more to the north, causing more storm systems to hit the Chicago area. The question remains whether temperatures will cause precipitation to fall as rain or snow. At this point, NOAA says there is 'equal probability' of temperatures above or below average, which could have a significant impact on whether it rains or snows in the region. According to NOAA, they have implemented several improvements to their forecasting tools, including an experimental model called the 'Winter Storm Severity Probability Index'. These data were used to help with this year's projections after it was first implemented at the end of 2023, according to officials. According to the University of Illinois, the strongest La Niña patterns can produce winters that are 'warmer and wetter than average', with more snow and winter storms during those seasons. A La Niña event also tends to cause colder springs if the pattern persists. In a La Niña event, the trade winds are stronger than usual and push warm water away from the Americas and towards Asia, allowing a process known as 'upwelling' to occur, which brings cold water to the ocean's surface. These cold waters cause polar jet streams to form more to the north, leading to droughts in the southern United States and more precipitation in the Midwest and the northwest Pacific.

**Temperatures falling — will the snow follow?**
Temperatures in Anchorage, Alaska are falling, but it's unclear if snow will follow. The average first date of measurable snow is October 16, but this year it might come earlier. A strong storm is brewing, set to hit over the weekend, bringing cooler temperatures and heavy rainfall. Snow levels are expected to drop to around 500 feet in Anchorage on Wednesday night, with hillside locations potentially seeing sticking or accumulating snow. According to the National Weather Service, snow would have to measure 0.10 of an inch to be considered 'measurable' and recorded. So far, October has been a dry month, with only 0.03 inches of precipitation. The hot spot in Alaska on Tuesday was Cordova at 59 degrees, while the cold spot was Kuparuk at 16 degrees.
