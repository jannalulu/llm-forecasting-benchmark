(NASDAQ:MODV), has recently increased its stake in the company with a significant purchase of shares. According to a recent SEC filing, the firm acquired a total of 82,264 shares over three days, from October 25 to 29, 2024. The transactions were executed at prices ranging from $14.65 to $15.69 per share, totaling approximately $1,264,636. These purchases reflect Q Global Capital Management's continued confidence in ModivCare's business prospects. ModivCare Inc. has been in the spotlight recently after its latest earnings report and subsequent analyst comments. The healthcare services provider reported stable revenues of $698 million compared to the previous year and an adjusted EBITDA of $45 million for the second quarter of 2024. However, the company suffered a net loss of $129 million, largely due to a $105 million impairment of the patient monitoring segment's goodwill. Despite these challenges, ModivCare reaffirmed its revenue guidance for the full year 2024 of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion and adjusted its EBITDA guidance to a range of $185 million to $195 million. The company is prioritizing debt reduction and operational optimization to achieve a three times leverage ratio. ModivCare also revealed difficulties in collecting approximately $60 million of its current contractual accounts receivable, mainly from its non-urgent medical transportation segment. As a result, the company adjusted its adjusted EBITDA forecast for 2024 and established a new growth guidance for 2025. Following these announcements, Lake Street Capital Markets revised its price target for ModivCare from $50.00 to $30.00, but maintained its Buy rating for the company's shares. The firm noted that, despite market reaction, ModivCare operates in large markets with substantial unmet needs and does not anticipate the company issuing additional capital at this time. InvestingPro's recent share price analysis suggests that ModivCare has experienced significant volatility, with a 10.33% price return in the last week coinciding with Q Global's acquisitions. This recent uptick contrasts sharply with the stock's performance for the year, which shows a substantial decline of 64.81%. Despite recent difficulties in the stock price, InvestingPro's advice suggests that ModivCare's net income is expected to grow this year, and analysts predict the company will be profitable. This perspective may have influenced Q Global Capital Management's decision to increase its stake, seeing potentially valuable growth in the company's future earnings. However, investors should note that ModivCare operates with a significant debt burden and is burning cash quickly, according to InvestingPro's advice. The company's P/E ratio is at 23.17, indicating that the market is assigning a premium to the company's assets relative to their book value. For a more in-depth analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for ModivCare, providing a more comprehensive view of the company's financial health and market position.

General manager Ryan Poles has a five-year contract with Eberflus and is reportedly committed to giving him a real shot with the current roster. Poles wants to avoid a repeat of the situation with former quarterback Justin Fields, who was traded after Poles took over as GM. The team has a solid defensive unit and skill position talent, but the offensive line has struggled with injuries. Despite the challenges, Poles is expected to stick with Eberflus, at least for now, and give the team a year to mature and create continuity. As Adam Rank said, 'Matt Eberflus actually has a five-year contract and that he might be more locked in... I talked to some people within NFL circles, people who are close to Ryan Poles, and they indicated to me that regardless of what happens...

Rank stated, 'They indicated to me that regardless of what happens at all, Matt Eberflus is coming back.' The Bears are currently 4-4 and have been plagued by consecutive ugly losses, with some players expressing concerns about Eberflus' ability to prepare the team.

He lists several reasons why, including Eberflus' inability to have his team ready to play after a bye week, allowing the Commanders to get into Hail Mary range, and not taking responsibility for his mistakes. Silvy also criticizes Eberflus for not being accountable, unlike players like Tyrique Stevenson and Caleb Williams.

Players have publicly questioned coaching decisions, with some calling for more discipline and better communication. Defensive players reportedly felt that Eberflus' 'positive spin on the day registers as very, very tone deaf' after the loss. Wide receiver DJ Moore expressed frustration with a goal line play-call, while cornerback Jaylon Johnson called for improvement in 'operation throughout the week.' Rookie quarterback Caleb Williams and tight end Cole Kmet also spoke about the need for more discipline, citing multiple teachable moments during the game and practice. The team's lack of discipline was evident on the final play, as cornerback Tyrique Stevenson was seen taunting Commanders fans and failing to follow his assignment.

However, many are skeptical of his sincerity, as he initially blamed the players for their 'execution' and only admitted fault after several players, including tight end Cole Kmet and cornerback Jaylon Johnson, criticized the team's culture. Eberflus' timing is also seen as suspicious, as he may have been trying to do damage control after the players' comments. The article suggests that Eberflus' job security is at risk, as the team is in win-now mode and he has a poor record on the road.

According to sources, Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, widely regarded as a top-five playcaller in the NFL, had expressed interest in joining the Bears as their head coach.

According to NFL insider Albert Breer, Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson was interested in coaching the Bears last season, but ultimately stayed with the Lions. Johnson, 38, has been instrumental in the Lions' success, leading their offense to a league-best 33.4 points per game this season.

Throughout the game, Eberflus failed to take responsibility for key moments, including a Hail Mary defense that was 'beyond embarrassing.' When asked about the play, Eberflus said his focus was on the last play, not the second-to-last play where the Commanders gained 13 yards, giving them better field position. He also declined to use three timeouts, saying everyone was in the correct position, despite defensive back Tyrique Stevenson yelling at the crowd on the final play. Eberflus' lack of accountability has raised concerns about his ability to lead the team, with some questioning whether he will be retained beyond this season. As he has only three total road wins in his three years as head coach, his reputation as a coach is being damaged by his refusal to take responsibility for the team's performance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 06:46 PM\nSource:[Yahoo Sports Canada](https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/every-time-matt-eberflus-declined-183507592.html)\n\n**Matt Eberflus has some explaining to do after Bears' Hail Mary meltdown**\nChicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus is facing criticism after a late-game coaching and team execution meltdown in an 18-15 loss to Washington. The Bears had a chance to win the game but made several mistakes, including rushing only three defenders, having a spy on Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels, and poor positioning. Cornerback Tyrique Stevenson was seen taunting Washington fans before the play, and Eberflus was confused about how the coverage broke down. Eberflus needs to address these issues and make sure the final two plays of the loss don't define his coaching career. He said, 'Our guys believe in each other, trust in each other, have faith in each other,' but the team's performance suggests otherwise.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 05:38 PM\nSource:[Yahoo Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/matt-eberflus-has-some-explaining-to-do-after-bears-hail-mary-meltdown-173724786.html)\n\n**Hail Mary! 3 miracle Matt Eberflus replacements Bears should have on speed dial**\nChicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus is under pressure, despite the team's surprising performance in 2024. The defense's lack of discipline and Eberflus's philosophy are to blame for the team's struggles. The Bears should consider replacing Eberflus with one of the following candidates: Brian Flores, who has head coaching experience and has turned the Minnesota Vikings defense into a force; Bill Belichick, who has expressed admiration for the late Buddy Ryan and has been a successful analyst this season; or Ben Johnson, who has a creative offensive mind and has been involved in the coaching cycle for two straight offseasons. Johnson would be a great fit for the Bears, as he is familiar with the division and could hire his own staff to mold quarterback Caleb Williams into one of the best young quarterbacks in the NFL.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 01:35 PM\nSource:[fansided.com](https://fansided.com/nfl-rumors-matt-eberflus-replacements-bears-belichick-flores-johnson-hail-mary)\n\n**Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus on the heartbreaking Hail Mary: 'We've practiced that play 100 times'**\nChicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus reflected on the team's heartbreaking 18-15 loss to a Hail Mary throw from Jayden Daniels to Noah Brown.

The Bears' rookie quarterback Caleb Williams has been performing above expectations, but Eberflus' reaction to the loss, which included a Hail Mary touchdown, looked like a man ready to be fired. As one writer noted, 'Eberflus can hardly be blamed for such a failure, as the Bears secondary ought to have, ya know, actually knocked the ball down rather than lobbing it in the air for an alley-oop to Brown.'

The offense has been struggling, and the play-calling has been criticized by the national media. Tight end Marcedes Lewis and other players expressed their frustration with offensive coordinator Shane Waldron's conservative play-calling, saying he treats the offense like a 'Pop Warner' team. The players had a 'private meeting' with Waldron, but the results were not fruitful, and the offense continued to rely on the screen game. This has led to questions about Eberflus' ability to develop a young quarterback, Caleb Williams, and whether he is the right person to lead the team. Three team captains have reportedly scolded Waldron for not coaching, and Justin Fields has vented about his previous coordinator, Luke Getsy.

The Bears have never fired a coach midseason, but with Mike Vrabel available, it could be a consideration. Poles' talent evaluation skills, particularly in the offensive line, have been questioned, as the team's line has been 'terrible' and the signing of Nate Davis has 'not aged well.' The Bears' upcoming game against the Rams is crucial, and the team's ability to cobble together a decent offensive line will be key to their success. The question of what to do about head coach Matt Eberflus looms large, and Poles' future as GM may depend on it.

Microsoft is currently in third place with a market capitalization of $3.2 trillion. Nvidia's stock price reached a record high of over $144 per share on Tuesday, October 22, after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, driven by growing demand for chips. Nvidia has become the largest beneficiary of the AI boom, which began after the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI in November 2022, according to CNBC. Large technology companies, including Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, are buying Nvidia's chips in large quantities for their AI-related projects. Nvidia controls around 95% of the market for AI training and inference chips, and its chips account for a significant portion of the multibillion-dollar spending by technology companies on AI development, according to Mizuho. Nvidia's stock price rose in October after CEO Jensen Huang announced that the company's new AI chip, Blackwell, is fully launched and in high demand.

Apple Intelligence will play a visible role in enhancing Apple's service revenue in FY25. We think Apple should be able to outperform expectations in the December quarter not on real-end demand recovery but on a better iPhone replacement cycle compared to the iPhone 15 lineup due to the added Apple Intelligence feature. We continue to believe Apple is fairly valued considering that the iPhone remains the gold standard for smartphones and Apple is the largest company by market cap.

Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk follow, with net worths of $198.4 billion and $195.3 billion, respectively. The report notes a record number of billionaires, with 2,781 worldwide, an increase of 141 from the previous year. The US remains the country with the most billionaires, and the sectors that have contributed the most to wealth generation include technology, luxury, and e-commerce. The fluctuations in the fortunes of these entrepreneurs are due to the volatility of financial markets and strategic moves such as acquisitions, mergers, or sales of assets. As Musk's position in the ranking fluctuates with the value of his companies' stocks, this landscape reflects not only the dynamics of markets and their impact on personal fortunes but also the dominant role of certain economic sectors in generating global wealth.

The rankings also predict that seven businesses will reach a trillion-dollar market cap valuation by July 2024, with Microsoft leading the list at $3.394 trillion. Additionally, several companies, including Tesla, are expected to hit trillion-dollar status in 2025, with Exxon Mobile and Chevron predicted to reach this milestone by 2028 and 2038, respectively.

Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk follow, with net worths of $198.4 billion and $195.3 billion, respectively. The report notes a record number of billionaires, with 2,781 worldwide, an increase of 141 from the previous year. The US remains the country with the most billionaires, and the sectors that have contributed the most to wealth generation include technology, luxury, and e-commerce. The fluctuations in the fortunes of these entrepreneurs are due to the volatility of financial markets and strategic moves such as acquisitions, mergers, or sales of assets. As Musk's position in the ranking fluctuates with the value of his companies' stocks, this landscape reflects not only the dynamics of markets and their impact on personal fortunes but also the dominant role of certain economic sectors in generating global wealth. The persistence of the US as a hub for billionaires and the continued growth in sectors like technology and luxury are indicative of broader trends in the global economy.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 18, 2024 07:30 AM\nSource:[DEBATE](https://www.debate.com.mx/mundo/Los-hombres-mas-ricos-del-mundo-en-2024-segun-la-revista-Forbes-esta-Carlos-Slim-en-la-lista-20240918-0038.html)\n\n**Musk to Hit Massive Financial Milestone, Set Record for Highest Net-Worth in World History**\nBillionaire Elon Musk is on track to become the world's first trillionaire by 2027, according to an analysis from Informa Connect Academy.

The 538 electors will meet in the state capitals on December 17 to cast their votes for president and vice president. The sealed ballots will then be sent to Washington, where they will be counted in a joint session of Congress on January 6, 2025. Kamala Harris, the current vice president, will preside over the session and announce Trump's victory. The transition process must begin five days after the election, and Trump has already invited Biden to discuss the handover of government affairs. Trump's team will need to fill 4,000 government positions, including ministers and employees in various commissions. About 1,200 of these appointments will need to be confirmed by the Senate, where Trump's Republicans will have a majority. Trump's transition team will be led by Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon, but friends and family, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Donald Trump Jr., are expected to play a key role in shaping the new government. Trump has already appointed Susan Wiles, his former campaign manager, as his White House chief of staff. Wiles is a longtime Republican strategist from Florida who led Trump's campaign in the state in 2016 and 2020.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 10:38 AM\nSource:[tagesschau.de](https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/amerika/fragen-antworten-zeitplan-nach-us-wahl-100.html)\n\n**Biden administration to focus on keeping government open until transfer of power: White House**\nThe White House announced that the outgoing Biden administration will prioritize keeping the government open until President-elect Donald Trump assumes office on January 20, 2025. Spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre stated, 'And we're going to make sure that we keep the government open... We're going to pass the NDAA that's important, and we're also going to make sure that we confirm well-qualified judicial nominees.' President Joe Biden emphasized the importance of a 'peaceful and orderly transition' and pledged to make each day count in the remaining 74 days of his term, saying, 'That's the responsibility we have to the American people...

To achieve this, he has 11 weeks: here's what's planned. This is a codified process, as outlined in the US Constitution, which sets a 11-week period between the election and the start of the new presidency. This time will be used to replace all White House staff and nominate nearly 4,000 key positions, including ministers, chiefs of staff, and commission members. Approximately 1,200 of these presidential nominations will require Senate confirmation, but this should not be an issue given the Senate's shift to the Republican party. During this two-month period, Biden will also need to prepare for the management of over 100 federal agencies and prepare for the first 100 days, considered a 'crash-test' of the new president's arrival. Biden will also need to brief his successor on ongoing and upcoming sensitive matters, with daily contact between the two presidents' staffs. This is a highly codified process, but one that relies on the good will of both presidents.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 06:32 PM\nSource:[rtl.be](https://www.rtl.be/actu/monde/international/donald-trump-ne-sera-pas-president-avant-11-semaines-quoi-sert-ce-delai/2024-11-07/article/727399)\n\n**Key dates to remember between now and Trump's inauguration**\nFollowing the 2024 election, former President Donald Trump is set to be inaugurated on January 20, 2025.

Trump is testing the changes.**\nThe first test of a new law aimed at preventing chaos during presidential transitions is causing anxiety as Donald Trump is potentially poised to return to power. The law, passed in 2022, requires federal agencies to open their doors to both Trump's and Vice President Kamala Harris's campaigns to begin the transition process within five days of the election. However, Trump has not signed the required ethics pledge and agreements, which could delay the start of a second administration and put the country at risk. Trump's team is working out of a Manhattan office and the Willard Hotel in Washington, vetting candidates for key positions, but has not submitted to a formal government ethics plan, which could lead to conflicts of interest. Harris, on the other hand, has signed the federal ethics pledge and other official transition agreements, but faces her own challenges in taking control of the bureaucracy of 2.2 million executive branch employees. Career leaders and officials are worried about the prolonged uncertainty over the election, which could take time away from pressing issues, such as addressing infectious-disease threats. Trump's allies have pledged to continue a dramatic overhaul of federal hiring rules called Schedule F, which could allow him to fire tens of thousands of federal workers and replace them with loyalists. 'We are in uncharted territory right now, and it has the potential to be complicated for everyone involved,' said Valerie Smith Boyd, director of the Center for Presidential Transition. 'There are a lot of things about a presidential transition that require government interaction, and they exist so things like getting your people cleared are not left to the last minute,' said Max Stier, president and chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 10:00 AM\nSource:[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/31/trump-transition-process-jan6-president/)\n\n**The Biden Administration Touts Its Big Year in AI**\nThe White House has announced that it has met all its year-one goals for the Biden administration's executive order on artificial intelligence.

Other agencies have created new rules and guidance documents for AI users. The federal government has also hired over 250 AI practitioners and created a Chief AI Officers' Council.

In each state, electors will be elected and will be responsible for designating the future president on December 17. According to Professor of Public Law Julien Boudon, this 'complex' and 'archaic' system multiplies the risks of contesting the election. Boudon notes that the US Constitution, written in 1787 and amended only 27 times in 237 years, leaves many things to the federal states, which increases the number of possible disputes.

For example, Joe Biden's appointment of a tough consumer protection advocate led to the Federal Trade Commission forcing gyms to allow membership cancellations. In contrast, Republican control of the Federal Communications Commission under Donald Trump resulted in the end of federal net neutrality rules, while Democratic control under Biden revived them.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 12:01 PM\nSource:[The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/24279103/2024-election-guide-trump-harris-policy-issues)\n\n**Plan to Reduce Bureaucracy: 'Those Without a Base Must Go' - 24 Horas**\nBy December 15, all federal dependencies must have freed up positions for advisors, honoraries, trust employees, and workers without a base. Those occupying these positions must leave to make room for people selected by the new secretaries of state and decentralized organizations. This is a result of the need to reduce the deficit in the internal product and generate foreign confidence. The government aims to reduce the over-expenditure from the previous election year by half in 2025. This will be achieved by reducing the number of federal employees, freezing their salaries, and allocating resources to new social programs, such as 'Salud en Casa' and support for women aged 60-64. The Secretary of Finance, Rogelio Ramírez de la O, will be able to boast this achievement to national and foreign investors.

The election will determine key positions, including the President, Vice President, Senators, Representatives, and Governors. Additionally, local elections will be held for mayors, councilors, prosecutors, judges, and other public offices. The Democratic and Republican parties are competing for the presidency, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump as the main candidates. The election will also determine 34 Senators and 435 Representatives, with 11 states holding gubernatorial elections. As of October 25, over 33 million people have already voted by mail or absentee ballot, with the top three states being Texas, Florida, and California. The Pew Research Center estimates that over 36 million Latinos are eligible to vote, with nine states being crucial for their vote. Seven 'swing' states, including Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, will be key in determining the outcome. However, it's worth noting that the popular vote does not determine the winner, but rather the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors. A candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. The election results will be projected on November 5, but the final decision will be made by the Electoral College in December. Some states require identification to vote, while others allow provisional ballots. Voters can check their registration and find their polling station on the Department of State's website or by contacting their local election office.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 09:11 PM\nSource:[evtv.online](https://evtv.online/eeuu-2024/datos-importantes-de-las-elecciones-en-ee-uu-detalles/)\n\n**US Presidential Election 2024: A Guide to the Process and Candidates**\nThe US presidential election is scheduled for November 5, 2024. The two main candidates are Donald Trump from the Republican Party and Kamala Harris from the Democratic Party. The election process in the US is complex, with each state having a certain number of electoral votes. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes, which is 270 or more, is declared the winner. However, it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but not the electoral vote. The US presidential election is an indirect process, where citizens of the states and Washington D.C. vote for electors who then cast their electoral votes. The candidate who receives the majority of the electoral votes is declared the winner. If no candidate receives a majority, the House of Representatives chooses the president. In the US, most citizens who are 18 or older are eligible to vote. However, each state has its own voter registration process and deadlines. Citizens living abroad can register to vote using the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) and request an absentee ballot. In addition to the presidential election, voters will also be choosing new members of Congress. The results of the election will be announced on election night, but in some cases, it may take several days to count all the votes. If the president changes, there will be a transition period before the new administration takes office. The new president will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, in a ceremony at the Capitol Building in Washington D.C.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 04:54 AM\nSource:[hindi](https://www.abplive.com/news/world/us-elections-2024-what-is-the-process-of-electing-the-president-know-everything-2809672)\n\n**US Presidential Elections: Key Dates and Facts**\nThe United States will hold presidential elections on November 5, 2024, where voters will choose the next president for the next four years.

This month, all eyes are on the United States as citizens decide whether to re-elect Donald Trump or choose Kamala Harris, the current vice president, to continue Joe Biden's legacy. The electoral process includes several key dates: November 5 (Tuesday) - Election Day, where Americans will vote for the next president, renew the House of Representatives, and one-third of the Senate. Additionally, various state and local positions will be up for election, including governors of 11 states and two territories. December 17 (Tuesday) - The Electoral Council, consisting of 538 members, will officially elect the next president. January 6 (Monday) - The Congress (House of Representatives and Senate) will receive, recount, and certify the electoral votes in a joint session presided over by Vice President Kamala Harris. January 20 (Monday) - The new president will take office in the Capitol, marking the official start of their term with a oath before the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

The elections will create uncertainty over how lawmakers will tackle the challenges ahead, and the fate of future Republican leadership in both the House and the Senate will factor heavily into legislative fights.

While the possibility of Musk taking on a government position with oversight commitments is real, it remains to be seen whether Trump's vision for a department focused on interdepartmental culling will become a reality.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2024 01:45 AM\nSource:[newstime365.in](https://newstime365.in/blog/2024/09/29/us-presidential-elections-2024-trump-touts-possibility-of-elon-musk-heading-department-of-efficiency)\n\n**Biden Signs Bill to Continue US Government Funding Until December 20**\nUS President Joe Biden signed a bill to continue funding the US government until December 20. According to the White House press release, 'on Thursday, September 26, 2024, the President signed the bill' which provides 'appropriations for projects and activities of executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government through December 20, 2024'. The Senate and House of Representatives previously approved the document on Wednesday. The Biden administration had previously stated that it is necessary to extend the funding of the US government until December 20 and urges both chambers of Congress to pass the corresponding bill as soon as possible. This would prevent a costly and unnecessary shutdown of government funding and give time to pass the 2025 budget later this year, as stated in the administration's statement.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 26, 2024 09:03 PM\nSource:[ТАСС](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/21970557)\n\n**Opinion: Focus on the administration, not the candidate**\nAs the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, many Americans are unsure about which candidate to vote for. Dr. Jason Giersch, an associate political science professor at UNC Charlotte, suggests that voters focus on the administration, not just the candidate. According to Giersch, the administration, including the vice president and 15 executive department heads, has a significant impact on policy decisions. He notes that 'members of the administration have a voice and have influence, but they can't do much on their own.' Giersch emphasizes the importance of researching the roles of cabinet members and the success of previous administrations in areas such as national security, education, and healthcare. He also highlights the significance of cabinet positions, such as the Secretaries of Defense, Treasury, and State, in shaping the president's policies. By examining the achievements and setbacks of past administrative departments, voters can gain a better understanding of which candidate is more likely to appoint qualified and resilient individuals to key positions. As Giersch notes, 'sometimes, candidates pledge to add or remove cabinet positions or entire departments. Such a pledge is a pretty good signal as to what the federal government's role in that area will be if they are elected.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 02:30 PM\nSource:[Niner Times](https://www.ninertimes.com/opinion/opinion-focus-on-the-administration-not-the-candidate/article_a640e20c-76bd-11ef-9aca-d7692cbed98d.html)\n\n**US Congress Leaders Reach Agreement to Avoid Government Shutdown**\nThe leaders of the US Congress announced an agreement on Sunday to extend federal government funding until mid-December, avoiding a contentious shutdown just weeks before the elections. The government funding was set to expire at the end of September, and a temporary measure, known as a 'continuing resolution' (CR), was expected. However, Republicans had been demanding that any extension of funds be tied to new requirements for voters to prove their US citizenship, a pressure motivated by Donald Trump's unfounded claims of widespread election fraud. The Wednesday vote in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives failed, and the agreement announced on Sunday excludes the voting provisions and extends funding only until December 20. This delays the debate on funding until well after the November 5 elections, where control of the House of Representatives, Senate, and Presidency is expected to be decided by narrow margins. The next Congress will convene shortly after New Year's, while the inauguration of the next president - either Republican Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris - will take place on January 20.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 12:25 AM\nSource:[El Universo](https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/internacional/acuerdo-entre-lideres-del-congreso-de-ee-uu-evita-cierre-de-gobierno-nota)\n\n**Understanding the Organization of the 2024 US Presidential Election**\nThe 2024 US presidential election will take place on November 5, with 244 million Americans eligible to vote.

According to Pacheco, the sanction 'closes a long path of maturation of discussions between the government and the National Congress on the theme'. President Lula sanctioned the law with four vetoes. The law, approved by the National Congress last week, is the result of many negotiations between the federal government and the Legislature. Pacheco highlighted that 'the consensus achieved represents a very favorable solution for the economic sectors and, above all, for the Brazilian municipalities, which will now have a very relevant measure to balance public accounts.' The text sanctioned by Lula maintains the total desoneration until December 2024, starting the gradual reoneration process from 2025 until 2027. In 2028, the reoneration will return totally. The points vetoed by the head of the Executive were pointed out by the AGU (Advocacia-Geral da União) and the Ministry of Finance. One of the points vetoed was the deadline for claiming forgotten resources in financial institutions. According to the text that left the Congress, the values could be claimed until December 31, 2027. But, with the veto, the value can be claimed in up to 30 days from this Monday.

In the US, citizens do not directly vote for the president and vice president, but for the electors. There are a total of 538 electors, distributed based on the population of each state, plus three representatives from the District of Columbia, which will officially elect the president. The candidate who receives at least 270 votes wins the election. According to the Electoral Count Act of 1877, states have a five-week period after the election (until December 11) to resolve any disputes related to the election before the Electoral College meets on December 17. Then, on January 6, 2025, the electoral votes will be officially counted during a joint session of Congress, and the Senate President will announce the election results. The winner will take office at the White House on January 20, 2025. The latest polls show that the race between the two candidates is closer than ever, with Kamala Harris's lead over Donald Trump narrowing to less than one percentage point, according to the New York Times. The challenges in key states (Swing States) remain tight, with no candidate holding a significant advantage in the seven most likely states to decide the presidency, writes the NYT. As the NYT notes, when the national vote is tied, it is not a good omen for Democrats, as Trump did better in key states than nationally in the two previous elections, allowing him to win in 2016 without winning the national popular vote and narrowly losing to Joe Biden in 2020.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 02:55 PM\nSource:[Fanpage](https://www.fanpage.it/esteri/quando-ci-saranno-le-elezioni-usa-2024-la-data-e-cosa-dicono-gli-ultimi-sondaggi-sulla-sfida-trump-harris/)\n\n**The pragmatist's guide to the 2024 presidential election**\nThe 2024 presidential election will have a significant impact on various areas, including antitrust, broadband, and climate change.

Additionally, local elections will be held for mayors, councilors, prosecutors, judges, and other public offices. The Democratic and Republican parties are competing for the presidency, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump as the main candidates. The election will also determine 34 Senators and 435 Representatives, with 11 states holding gubernatorial elections. As of October 25, over 33 million people have already voted by mail or absentee ballot, with the top three states being Texas, Florida, and California. The Pew Research Center estimates that over 36 million Latinos are eligible to vote, with nine states being crucial for their vote. Seven 'swing' states, including Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, will be key in determining the outcome. However, it's worth noting that the popular vote does not determine the winner, but rather the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors. A candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. The election results will be projected on November 5, but the final decision will be made by the Electoral College in December.

The two main candidates are Donald Trump from the Republican Party and Kamala Harris from the Democratic Party. The election process in the US is complex, with each state having a certain number of electoral votes. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes, which is 270 or more, is declared the winner. However, it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but not the electoral vote. The US presidential election is an indirect process, where citizens of the states and Washington D.C. vote for electors who then cast their electoral votes. The candidate who receives the majority of the electoral votes is declared the winner. If no candidate receives a majority, the House of Representatives chooses the president. In the US, most citizens who are 18 or older are eligible to vote. However, each state has its own voter registration process and deadlines. Citizens living abroad can register to vote using the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) and request an absentee ballot. In addition to the presidential election, voters will also be choosing new members of Congress. The results of the election will be announced on election night, but in some cases, it may take several days to count all the votes.

The elections will create uncertainty over how lawmakers will tackle the challenges ahead, and the fate of future Republican leadership in both the House and the Senate will factor heavily into legislative fights. Funding the government will take center stage in the immediate aftermath of the elections, with a Dec. 20 funding deadline during a lame-duck session. There are also growing calls for Congress to pass additional disaster relief in the wake of hurricanes Milton and Helene. A new Congress will convene in the opening days of 2025, and lawmakers will have to confront the federal debt limit, which will be reinstated on Jan. 2. Shai Akabas, the executive director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said, 'Congress thrives on deadlines and operating at the last minute. When it comes to the debt limit, there is no definitive last minute because we don’t know exactly when that point will arrive, unlike a government shutdown.' Lawmakers will also have to pass a final version of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2025, renew key agriculture policy, and negotiate a tax package, including more than $3.4 trillion in individual income and estate tax cuts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 20, 2024 01:30 PM\nSource:[koco.com](https://www.koco.com/article/capitol-hill-agenda-november/62661091)\n\n**Lawmakers face jam-packed agenda after elections with government funding and debt limit on the horizon**\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill face a packed agenda after the November elections, including averting a federal government shutdown before the end of 2024 and addressing the debt limit in the new year.

Dr. Jason Giersch, an associate political science professor at UNC Charlotte, suggests that voters focus on the administration, not just the candidate. According to Giersch, the administration, including the vice president and 15 executive department heads, has a significant impact on policy decisions. He notes that 'members of the administration have a voice and have influence, but they can't do much on their own.' Giersch emphasizes the importance of researching the roles of cabinet members and the success of previous administrations in areas such as national security, education, and healthcare. He also highlights the significance of cabinet positions, such as the Secretaries of Defense, Treasury, and State, in shaping the president's policies. By examining the achievements and setbacks of past administrative departments, voters can gain a better understanding of which candidate is more likely to appoint qualified and resilient individuals to key positions. As Giersch notes, 'sometimes, candidates pledge to add or remove cabinet positions or entire departments. Such a pledge is a pretty good signal as to what the federal government's role in that area will be if they are elected.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 02:30 PM\nSource:[Niner Times](https://www.ninertimes.com/opinion/opinion-focus-on-the-administration-not-the-candidate/article_a640e20c-76bd-11ef-9aca-d7692cbed98d.html)\n\n**US Congress Leaders Reach Agreement to Avoid Government Shutdown**\nThe leaders of the US Congress announced an agreement on Sunday to extend federal government funding until mid-December, avoiding a contentious shutdown just weeks before the elections. The government funding was set to expire at the end of September, and a temporary measure, known as a 'continuing resolution' (CR), was expected. However, Republicans had been demanding that any extension of funds be tied to new requirements for voters to prove their US citizenship, a pressure motivated by Donald Trump's unfounded claims of widespread election fraud. The Wednesday vote in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives failed, and the agreement announced on Sunday excludes the voting provisions and extends funding only until December 20. This delays the debate on funding until well after the November 5 elections, where control of the House of Representatives, Senate, and Presidency is expected to be decided by narrow margins.

According to Pacheco, the sanction 'closes a long path of maturation of discussions between the government and the National Congress on the theme'. President Lula sanctioned the law with four vetoes. The law, approved by the National Congress last week, is the result of many negotiations between the federal government and the Legislature. Pacheco highlighted that 'the consensus achieved represents a very favorable solution for the economic sectors and, above all, for the Brazilian municipalities, which will now have a very relevant measure to balance public accounts.' The text sanctioned by Lula maintains the total desoneration until December 2024, starting the gradual reoneration process from 2025 until 2027. In 2028, the reoneration will return totally. The points vetoed by the head of the Executive were pointed out by the AGU (Advocacia-Geral da União) and the Ministry of Finance. One of the points vetoed was the deadline for claiming forgotten resources in financial institutions.

According to the Electoral Count Act of 1877, states have a five-week period after the election (until December 11) to resolve any disputes related to the election before the Electoral College meets on December 17. Then, on January 6, 2025, the electoral votes will be officially counted during a joint session of Congress, and the Senate President will announce the election results. The winner will take office at the White House on January 20, 2025. The latest polls show that the race between the two candidates is closer than ever, with Kamala Harris's lead over Donald Trump narrowing to less than one percentage point, according to the New York Times. The challenges in key states (Swing States) remain tight, with no candidate holding a significant advantage in the seven most likely states to decide the presidency, writes the NYT. As the NYT notes, when the national vote is tied, it is not a good omen for Democrats, as Trump did better in key states than nationally in the two previous elections, allowing him to win in 2016 without winning the national popular vote and narrowly losing to Joe Biden in 2020.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 02:55 PM\nSource:[Fanpage](https://www.fanpage.it/esteri/quando-ci-saranno-le-elezioni-usa-2024-la-data-e-cosa-dicono-gli-ultimi-sondaggi-sulla-sfida-trump-harris/)\n\n**The pragmatist's guide to the 2024 presidential election**\nThe 2024 presidential election will have a significant impact on various areas, including antitrust, broadband, and climate change.

For example, Joe Biden's appointment of a tough consumer protection advocate led to the Federal Trade Commission forcing gyms to allow membership cancellations. In contrast, Republican control of the Federal Communications Commission under Donald Trump resulted in the end of federal net neutrality rules, while Democratic control under Biden revived them.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 12:01 PM\nSource:[The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/24279103/2024-election-guide-trump-harris-policy-issues)\n\n**2024 US Presidential Election: Key Facts and Figures**\nThe 2024 US presidential election is scheduled for November 5, with over 244 million eligible voters. The election will determine key positions, including the President, Vice President, Senators, Representatives, and Governors. Additionally, local elections will be held for mayors, councilors, prosecutors, judges, and other public offices. The Democratic and Republican parties are competing for the presidency, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump as the main candidates. The election will also determine 34 Senators and 435 Representatives, with 11 states holding gubernatorial elections. As of October 25, over 33 million people have already voted by mail or absentee ballot, with the top three states being Texas, Florida, and California. The Pew Research Center estimates that over 36 million Latinos are eligible to vote, with nine states being crucial for their vote. Seven 'swing' states, including Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, will be key in determining the outcome. However, it's worth noting that the popular vote does not determine the winner, but rather the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors. A candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. The election results will be projected on November 5, but the final decision will be made by the Electoral College in December. Some states require identification to vote, while others allow provisional ballots. Voters can check their registration and find their polling station on the Department of State's website or by contacting their local election office.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 09:11 PM\nSource:[evtv.online](https://evtv.online/eeuu-2024/datos-importantes-de-las-elecciones-en-ee-uu-detalles/)\n\n**US Presidential Election 2024: A Guide to the Process and Candidates**\nThe US presidential election is scheduled for November 5, 2024. The two main candidates are Donald Trump from the Republican Party and Kamala Harris from the Democratic Party. The election process in the US is complex, with each state having a certain number of electoral votes. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes, which is 270 or more, is declared the winner. However, it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but not the electoral vote. The US presidential election is an indirect process, where citizens of the states and Washington D.C. vote for electors who then cast their electoral votes. The candidate who receives the majority of the electoral votes is declared the winner. If no candidate receives a majority, the House of Representatives chooses the president. In the US, most citizens who are 18 or older are eligible to vote. However, each state has its own voter registration process and deadlines. Citizens living abroad can register to vote using the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) and request an absentee ballot. In addition to the presidential election, voters will also be choosing new members of Congress. The results of the election will be announced on election night, but in some cases, it may take several days to count all the votes. If the president changes, there will be a transition period before the new administration takes office. The new president will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, in a ceremony at the Capitol Building in Washington D.C.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 04:54 AM\nSource:[hindi](https://www.abplive.com/news/world/us-elections-2024-what-is-the-process-of-electing-the-president-know-everything-2809672)\n\n**Lawmakers face jam-packed agenda after Election Day; government funding, debt limit on the horizon**\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill face a jam-packed agenda after the November elections, including averting a federal government shutdown before the end of 2024 and addressing the debt limit in the new year. The elections will create uncertainty over how lawmakers will tackle the challenges ahead, and the fate of future Republican leadership in both the House and the Senate will factor heavily into legislative fights.

There are also growing calls for Congress to pass additional disaster relief in the wake of hurricanes Milton and Helene. A new Congress will convene in the opening days of 2025, and lawmakers will have to confront the federal debt limit, which will be reinstated on Jan. 2.

The Biden administration had previously stated that it is necessary to extend the funding of the US government until December 20 and urges both chambers of Congress to pass the corresponding bill as soon as possible.

Dr. Jason Giersch, an associate political science professor at UNC Charlotte, suggests that voters focus on the administration, not just the candidate. According to Giersch, the administration, including the vice president and 15 executive department heads, has a significant impact on policy decisions. He notes that 'members of the administration have a voice and have influence, but they can't do much on their own.' Giersch emphasizes the importance of researching the roles of cabinet members and the success of previous administrations in areas such as national security, education, and healthcare. He also highlights the significance of cabinet positions, such as the Secretaries of Defense, Treasury, and State, in shaping the president's policies. By examining the achievements and setbacks of past administrative departments, voters can gain a better understanding of which candidate is more likely to appoint qualified and resilient individuals to key positions. As Giersch notes, 'sometimes, candidates pledge to add or remove cabinet positions or entire departments. Such a pledge is a pretty good signal as to what the federal government's role in that area will be if they are elected.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 02:30 PM\nSource:[Niner Times](https://www.ninertimes.com/opinion/opinion-focus-on-the-administration-not-the-candidate/article_a640e20c-76bd-11ef-9aca-d7692cbed98d.html)\n\n**US Congress Leaders Reach Agreement to Avoid Government Shutdown**\nThe leaders of the US Congress announced an agreement on Sunday to extend federal government funding until mid-December, avoiding a contentious shutdown just weeks before the elections. The government funding was set to expire at the end of September, and a temporary measure, known as a 'continuing resolution' (CR), was expected. However, Republicans had been demanding that any extension of funds be tied to new requirements for voters to prove their US citizenship, a pressure motivated by Donald Trump's unfounded claims of widespread election fraud. The Wednesday vote in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives failed, and the agreement announced on Sunday excludes the voting provisions and extends funding only until December 20. This delays the debate on funding until well after the November 5 elections, where control of the House of Representatives, Senate, and Presidency is expected to be decided by narrow margins.

The new administration will take over on January 20, 2025, and during this period, there will be a transitional period of 11 weeks during which power will be transferred from the current administration led by Joe Biden to the new leadership of Trump. This period, which may seem long to some, is less than 4 months, which is the maximum period specified by the constitution for the transfer of power. This transitional period is called 'the lame duck' period, which begins on the day the election results are announced and ends on the day of the inauguration. According to American law, Biden will retain all presidential powers until January 20, 2025, while the elected president will not have any executive powers until he takes office, and he will not be able to make any foreign visits during the transitional period. The new administration's task during this period is to focus on domestic issues only, despite the president's right to meet with foreign representatives to outline his foreign policy. The incoming president will receive the necessary funds for the transition process and will receive briefings from the outgoing administration, as well as daily or almost daily intelligence briefings during the transitional period, and mandatory protection from the American intelligence service.

In the US, citizens do not directly vote for the president and vice president, but for the electors. There are a total of 538 electors, distributed based on the population of each state, plus three representatives from the District of Columbia, which will officially elect the president. The candidate who receives at least 270 votes wins the election. According to the Electoral Count Act of 1877, states have a five-week period after the election (until December 11) to resolve any disputes related to the election before the Electoral College meets on December 17. Then, on January 6, 2025, the electoral votes will be officially counted during a joint session of Congress, and the Senate President will announce the election results. The winner will take office at the White House on January 20, 2025. The latest polls show that the race between the two candidates is closer than ever, with Kamala Harris's lead over Donald Trump narrowing to less than one percentage point, according to the New York Times. The challenges in key states (Swing States) remain tight, with no candidate holding a significant advantage in the seven most likely states to decide the presidency, writes the NYT. As the NYT notes, when the national vote is tied, it is not a good omen for Democrats, as Trump did better in key states than nationally in the two previous elections, allowing him to win in 2016 without winning the national popular vote and narrowly losing to Joe Biden in 2020.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 02:55 PM\nSource:[Fanpage](https://www.fanpage.it/esteri/quando-ci-saranno-le-elezioni-usa-2024-la-data-e-cosa-dicono-gli-ultimi-sondaggi-sulla-sfida-trump-harris/)\n\n**The pragmatist's guide to the 2024 presidential election**\nThe 2024 presidential election will have a significant impact on various areas, including antitrust, broadband, and climate change.

The election will determine key positions, including the President, Vice President, Senators, Representatives, and Governors. Additionally, local elections will be held for mayors, councilors, prosecutors, judges, and other public offices. The Democratic and Republican parties are competing for the presidency, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump as the main candidates. The election will also determine 34 Senators and 435 Representatives, with 11 states holding gubernatorial elections. As of October 25, over 33 million people have already voted by mail or absentee ballot, with the top three states being Texas, Florida, and California. The Pew Research Center estimates that over 36 million Latinos are eligible to vote, with nine states being crucial for their vote. Seven 'swing' states, including Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, will be key in determining the outcome. However, it's worth noting that the popular vote does not determine the winner, but rather the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors. A candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. The election results will be projected on November 5, but the final decision will be made by the Electoral College in December. Some states require identification to vote, while others allow provisional ballots. Voters can check their registration and find their polling station on the Department of State's website or by contacting their local election office.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 09:11 PM\nSource:[evtv.online](https://evtv.online/eeuu-2024/datos-importantes-de-las-elecciones-en-ee-uu-detalles/)\n\n**None of the Polls so far has shown a runoff- Executive Director of Global InfoAnalytics**\nAccording to Musah Dankwah, Executive Director and Head of Global Research at Global InfoAnalytics, recent polls indicate that there will be no runoff in the December 7th elections.

The two main candidates are Donald Trump from the Republican Party and Kamala Harris from the Democratic Party. The election process in the US is complex, with each state having a certain number of electoral votes. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes, which is 270 or more, is declared the winner. However, it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but not the electoral vote. The US presidential election is an indirect process, where citizens of the states and Washington D.C. vote for electors who then cast their electoral votes. The candidate who receives the majority of the electoral votes is declared the winner. If no candidate receives a majority, the House of Representatives chooses the president. In the US, most citizens who are 18 or older are eligible to vote. However, each state has its own voter registration process and deadlines. Citizens living abroad can register to vote using the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) and request an absentee ballot. In addition to the presidential election, voters will also be choosing new members of Congress. The results of the election will be announced on election night, but in some cases, it may take several days to count all the votes. If the president changes, there will be a transition period before the new administration takes office. The new president will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, in a ceremony at the Capitol Building in Washington D.C.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 04:54 AM\nSource:[hindi](https://www.abplive.com/news/world/us-elections-2024-what-is-the-process-of-electing-the-president-know-everything-2809672)\n\n**US Presidential Elections: Key Dates and Facts**\nThe United States will hold presidential elections on November 5, 2024, where voters will choose the next president for the next four years.

This month, all eyes are on the United States as citizens decide whether to re-elect Donald Trump or choose Kamala Harris, the current vice president, to continue Joe Biden's legacy. The electoral process includes several key dates: November 5 (Tuesday) - Election Day, where Americans will vote for the next president, renew the House of Representatives, and one-third of the Senate. Additionally, various state and local positions will be up for election, including governors of 11 states and two territories. December 17 (Tuesday) - The Electoral Council, consisting of 538 members, will officially elect the next president. January 6 (Monday) - The Congress (House of Representatives and Senate) will receive, recount, and certify the electoral votes in a joint session presided over by Vice President Kamala Harris.

Dr. Jason Giersch, an associate political science professor at UNC Charlotte, suggests that voters focus on the administration, not just the candidate. According to Giersch, the administration, including the vice president and 15 executive department heads, has a significant impact on policy decisions. He notes that 'members of the administration have a voice and have influence, but they can't do much on their own.' Giersch emphasizes the importance of researching the roles of cabinet members and the success of previous administrations in areas such as national security, education, and healthcare. He also highlights the significance of cabinet positions, such as the Secretaries of Defense, Treasury, and State, in shaping the president's policies. By examining the achievements and setbacks of past administrative departments, voters can gain a better understanding of which candidate is more likely to appoint qualified and resilient individuals to key positions. As Giersch notes, 'sometimes, candidates pledge to add or remove cabinet positions or entire departments. Such a pledge is a pretty good signal as to what the federal government's role in that area will be if they are elected.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 02:30 PM\nSource:[Niner Times](https://www.ninertimes.com/opinion/opinion-focus-on-the-administration-not-the-candidate/article_a640e20c-76bd-11ef-9aca-d7692cbed98d.html)\n\n**US Congress Leaders Reach Agreement to Avoid Government Shutdown**\nThe leaders of the US Congress announced an agreement on Sunday to extend federal government funding until mid-December, avoiding a contentious shutdown just weeks before the elections.

However, Republicans had been demanding that any extension of funds be tied to new requirements for voters to prove their US citizenship, a pressure motivated by Donald Trump's unfounded claims of widespread election fraud. The Wednesday vote in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives failed, and the agreement announced on Sunday excludes the voting provisions and extends funding only until December 20. This delays the debate on funding until well after the November 5 elections, where control of the House of Representatives, Senate, and Presidency is expected to be decided by narrow margins.

The election will determine the next President of the United States, with the winner requiring at least 270 electoral votes. The election process is indirect, with voters selecting electors who will then choose the President. The electors will cast their votes on December 16, 2024. The election is crucial, as the President has significant power, including the ability to make executive orders and influence foreign policy. The election will also determine the composition of the US Congress, with all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and approximately one-third of the 100 seats in the Senate up for election. The election is expected to be closely contested, with several key states, including Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, playing a crucial role in determining the outcome. The election process has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many voters opting for mail-in ballots. The Associated Press will provide reliable election results, which will be announced on November 5, 2024. The inauguration of the new President will take place on January 20, 2025. \nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 19, 2024 08:59 AM\nSource:[BILD](https://www.bild.de/politik/ausland/politik-ausland/us-wahl-2024-alle-infos-wahlsystem-bedeutung-wichtige-fakten-88940880.bild.html)\n\n**Reoneração da folha é 'solução muito favorável para os setores da economia', diz Pacheco**\nThe President of the National Congress, Senator Rodrigo Pacheco, celebrated the sanctioning of the law that gradually renews the payroll for the 17 economic sectors and municipalities with up to 156,000 inhabitants. According to Pacheco, the sanction 'closes a long path of maturation of discussions between the government and the National Congress on the theme'. President Lula sanctioned the law with four vetoes. The law, approved by the National Congress last week, is the result of many negotiations between the federal government and the Legislature. Pacheco highlighted that 'the consensus achieved represents a very favorable solution for the economic sectors and, above all, for the Brazilian municipalities, which will now have a very relevant measure to balance public accounts.' The text sanctioned by Lula maintains the total desoneration until December 2024, starting the gradual reoneration process from 2025 until 2027. In 2028, the reoneration will return totally. The points vetoed by the head of the Executive were pointed out by the AGU (Advocacia-Geral da União) and the Ministry of Finance. One of the points vetoed was the deadline for claiming forgotten resources in financial institutions. According to the text that left the Congress, the values could be claimed until December 31, 2027. But, with the veto, the value can be claimed in up to 30 days from this Monday. Then, the National Treasury will start collecting the values.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 17, 2024 12:29 AM\nSource:[R7 Notícias](https://noticias.r7.com/brasilia/reoneracao-da-folha-e-solucao-muito-favoravel-para-os-setores-da-economia-diz-pacheco-16092024/)\n\n**Sheinbaum Announces New Appointments to Her Government**\nMexico's incoming president, Claudia Sheinbaum, announced new appointments to her government, set to begin on October 1, 2024.

The new administration will take over on January 20, 2025, and during this period, there will be a transitional period of 11 weeks during which power will be transferred from the current administration led by Joe Biden to the new leadership of Trump. This period, which may seem long to some, is less than 4 months, which is the maximum period specified by the constitution for the transfer of power. This transitional period is called 'the lame duck' period, which begins on the day the election results are announced and ends on the day of the inauguration. According to American law, Biden will retain all presidential powers until January 20, 2025, while the elected president will not have any executive powers until he takes office, and he will not be able to make any foreign visits during the transitional period. The new administration's task during this period is to focus on domestic issues only, despite the president's right to meet with foreign representatives to outline his foreign policy. The incoming president will receive the necessary funds for the transition process and will receive briefings from the outgoing administration, as well as daily or almost daily intelligence briefings during the transitional period, and mandatory protection from the American intelligence service. Legally, all election-related lawsuits must be resolved by December 8, and before January 6, 2025, the date of the official certification of the election results by Congress.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[coptstoday.com](https://www.coptstoday.com/557096/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B7%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%87%D9%83%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A9)\n\n**The Biden Administration Touts Its Big Year in AI**\nThe White House has announced that it has met all its year-one goals for the Biden administration's executive order on artificial intelligence.

The election process in the US is different from Austria, as voters choose electors rather than parties. The president is elected every four years and can serve a maximum of two terms. The president has significant power and is responsible for implementing laws. There are two main parties in the US: the Republicans, led by Donald Trump, and the Democrats, led by Kamala Harris. The Republicans prioritize tradition and family, while the Democrats focus on workers' rights and progress. Before the presidential election, there are primary elections, where voters choose delegates who then select the party's candidate. This year, the delegates chose Donald Trump for the Republicans and Kamala Harris for the Democrats. The election is not a direct vote, but rather a vote for electors who represent each state. The number of electors varies by state, with some states having as few as 3 electors and others having as many as 55. To win a state, a candidate must receive a majority of the electors. The candidate with the majority of the 538 electors will become the next president. The electoral votes will be counted in December, and the new president will be announced in January 2025.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 05:17 AM\nSource:[newsORF.at](https://orf.at/einfach/stories/3373862/)\n\n**US Presidential Election: Flaws in the Electoral System that Favor the Risk of Contestation**\nThe United States will hold 51 simultaneous presidential elections on November 5. In each state, electors will be elected and will be responsible for designating the future president on December 17. According to Professor of Public Law Julien Boudon, this 'complex' and 'archaic' system multiplies the risks of contesting the election. Boudon notes that the US Constitution, written in 1787 and amended only 27 times in 237 years, leaves many things to the federal states, which increases the number of possible disputes. 'We saw this in 2020 and we will inevitably see it again in 2024,' he warns.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 05:05 PM\nSource:[ledauphine.com](https://www.ledauphine.com/elections/2024/10/29/ces-failles-du-systeme-electoral-qui-favorisent-les-risques-de-contestation)\n\n**US Presidential Election 2024: Latest Polls Show Tight Race Between Trump and Harris**\nThe 2024 US presidential election will take place on November 5, where voters will not only choose the next president but also elect new members of the US Congress. In the US, citizens do not directly vote for the president and vice president, but for the electors. There are a total of 538 electors, distributed based on the population of each state, plus three representatives from the District of Columbia, which will officially elect the president. The candidate who receives at least 270 votes wins the election. According to the Electoral Count Act of 1877, states have a five-week period after the election (until December 11) to resolve any disputes related to the election before the Electoral College meets on December 17. Then, on January 6, 2025, the electoral votes will be officially counted during a joint session of Congress, and the Senate President will announce the election results. The winner will take office at the White House on January 20, 2025. The latest polls show that the race between the two candidates is closer than ever, with Kamala Harris's lead over Donald Trump narrowing to less than one percentage point, according to the New York Times. The challenges in key states (Swing States) remain tight, with no candidate holding a significant advantage in the seven most likely states to decide the presidency, writes the NYT. As the NYT notes, when the national vote is tied, it is not a good omen for Democrats, as Trump did better in key states than nationally in the two previous elections, allowing him to win in 2016 without winning the national popular vote and narrowly losing to Joe Biden in 2020.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 02:55 PM\nSource:[Fanpage](https://www.fanpage.it/esteri/quando-ci-saranno-le-elezioni-usa-2024-la-data-e-cosa-dicono-gli-ultimi-sondaggi-sulla-sfida-trump-harris/)\n\n**The pragmatist's guide to the 2024 presidential election**\nThe 2024 presidential election will have a significant impact on various areas, including antitrust, broadband, and climate change.

The election will determine key positions, including the President, Vice President, Senators, Representatives, and Governors. Additionally, local elections will be held for mayors, councilors, prosecutors, judges, and other public offices. The Democratic and Republican parties are competing for the presidency, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump as the main candidates. The election will also determine 34 Senators and 435 Representatives, with 11 states holding gubernatorial elections. As of October 25, over 33 million people have already voted by mail or absentee ballot, with the top three states being Texas, Florida, and California. The Pew Research Center estimates that over 36 million Latinos are eligible to vote, with nine states being crucial for their vote. Seven 'swing' states, including Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, will be key in determining the outcome. However, it's worth noting that the popular vote does not determine the winner, but rather the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors. A candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. The election results will be projected on November 5, but the final decision will be made by the Electoral College in December. Some states require identification to vote, while others allow provisional ballots. Voters can check their registration and find their polling station on the Department of State's website or by contacting their local election office.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 09:11 PM\nSource:[evtv.online](https://evtv.online/eeuu-2024/datos-importantes-de-las-elecciones-en-ee-uu-detalles/)\n\n**US Presidential Election 2024: A Guide to the Process and Candidates**\nThe US presidential election is scheduled for November 5, 2024. The two main candidates are Donald Trump from the Republican Party and Kamala Harris from the Democratic Party. The election process in the US is complex, with each state having a certain number of electoral votes. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes, which is 270 or more, is declared the winner. However, it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but not the electoral vote. The US presidential election is an indirect process, where citizens of the states and Washington D.C. vote for electors who then cast their electoral votes. The candidate who receives the majority of the electoral votes is declared the winner. If no candidate receives a majority, the House of Representatives chooses the president. In the US, most citizens who are 18 or older are eligible to vote. However, each state has its own voter registration process and deadlines. Citizens living abroad can register to vote using the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) and request an absentee ballot. In addition to the presidential election, voters will also be choosing new members of Congress. The results of the election will be announced on election night, but in some cases, it may take several days to count all the votes. If the president changes, there will be a transition period before the new administration takes office. The new president will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, in a ceremony at the Capitol Building in Washington D.C.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 04:54 AM\nSource:[hindi](https://www.abplive.com/news/world/us-elections-2024-what-is-the-process-of-electing-the-president-know-everything-2809672)\n\n**Lawmakers face jam-packed agenda after Election Day; government funding, debt limit on the horizon**\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill face a jam-packed agenda after the November elections, including averting a federal government shutdown before the end of 2024 and addressing the debt limit in the new year.

This would prevent a costly and unnecessary shutdown of government funding and give time to pass the 2025 budget later this year, as stated in the administration's statement.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 26, 2024 09:03 PM\nSource:[ТАСС](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/21970557)\n\n**Opinion: Focus on the administration, not the candidate**\nAs the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, many Americans are unsure about which candidate to vote for. Dr. Jason Giersch, an associate political science professor at UNC Charlotte, suggests that voters focus on the administration, not just the candidate. According to Giersch, the administration, including the vice president and 15 executive department heads, has a significant impact on policy decisions. He notes that 'members of the administration have a voice and have influence, but they can't do much on their own.' Giersch emphasizes the importance of researching the roles of cabinet members and the success of previous administrations in areas such as national security, education, and healthcare. He also highlights the significance of cabinet positions, such as the Secretaries of Defense, Treasury, and State, in shaping the president's policies. By examining the achievements and setbacks of past administrative departments, voters can gain a better understanding of which candidate is more likely to appoint qualified and resilient individuals to key positions. As Giersch notes, 'sometimes, candidates pledge to add or remove cabinet positions or entire departments. Such a pledge is a pretty good signal as to what the federal government's role in that area will be if they are elected.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 02:30 PM\nSource:[Niner Times](https://www.ninertimes.com/opinion/opinion-focus-on-the-administration-not-the-candidate/article_a640e20c-76bd-11ef-9aca-d7692cbed98d.html)\n\n**US Congress Leaders Reach Agreement to Avoid Government Shutdown**\nThe leaders of the US Congress announced an agreement on Sunday to extend federal government funding until mid-December, avoiding a contentious shutdown just weeks before the elections. The government funding was set to expire at the end of September, and a temporary measure, known as a 'continuing resolution' (CR), was expected. However, Republicans had been demanding that any extension of funds be tied to new requirements for voters to prove their US citizenship, a pressure motivated by Donald Trump's unfounded claims of widespread election fraud. The Wednesday vote in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives failed, and the agreement announced on Sunday excludes the voting provisions and extends funding only until December 20. This delays the debate on funding until well after the November 5 elections, where control of the House of Representatives, Senate, and Presidency is expected to be decided by narrow margins. The next Congress will convene shortly after New Year's, while the inauguration of the next president - either Republican Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris - will take place on January 20.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 12:25 AM\nSource:[El Universo](https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/internacional/acuerdo-entre-lideres-del-congreso-de-ee-uu-evita-cierre-de-gobierno-nota)\n\n**US Congress Leaders Reach Agreement to Avoid Government Shutdown**\nThe leaders of the US Congress announced an agreement on Sunday to extend federal government funding until mid-December, avoiding a shutdown just weeks before the presidential elections.

According to Pacheco, the sanction 'closes a long path of maturation of discussions between the government and the National Congress on the theme'. President Lula sanctioned the law with four vetoes. The law, approved by the National Congress last week, is the result of many negotiations between the federal government and the Legislature. Pacheco highlighted that 'the consensus achieved represents a very favorable solution for the economic sectors and, above all, for the Brazilian municipalities, which will now have a very relevant measure to balance public accounts.' The text sanctioned by Lula maintains the total desoneration until December 2024, starting the gradual reoneration process from 2025 until 2027. In 2028, the reoneration will return totally. The points vetoed by the head of the Executive were pointed out by the AGU (Advocacia-Geral da União) and the Ministry of Finance. One of the points vetoed was the deadline for claiming forgotten resources in financial institutions.

The new administration will take over on January 20, 2025, and during this period, there will be a transitional period of 11 weeks during which power will be transferred from the current administration led by Joe Biden to the new leadership of Trump. This period, which may seem long to some, is less than 4 months, which is the maximum period specified by the constitution for the transfer of power. This transitional period is called 'the lame duck' period, which begins on the day the election results are announced and ends on the day of the inauguration. According to American law, Biden will retain all presidential powers until January 20, 2025, while the elected president will not have any executive powers until he takes office, and he will not be able to make any foreign visits during the transitional period. The new administration's task during this period is to focus on domestic issues only, despite the president's right to meet with foreign representatives to outline his foreign policy. The incoming president will receive the necessary funds for the transition process and will receive briefings from the outgoing administration, as well as daily or almost daily intelligence briefings during the transitional period, and mandatory protection from the American intelligence service.

In the US, citizens do not directly vote for the president and vice president, but for the electors. There are a total of 538 electors, distributed based on the population of each state, plus three representatives from the District of Columbia, which will officially elect the president. The candidate who receives at least 270 votes wins the election. According to the Electoral Count Act of 1877, states have a five-week period after the election (until December 11) to resolve any disputes related to the election before the Electoral College meets on December 17. Then, on January 6, 2025, the electoral votes will be officially counted during a joint session of Congress, and the Senate President will announce the election results. The winner will take office at the White House on January 20, 2025. The latest polls show that the race between the two candidates is closer than ever, with Kamala Harris's lead over Donald Trump narrowing to less than one percentage point, according to the New York Times. The challenges in key states (Swing States) remain tight, with no candidate holding a significant advantage in the seven most likely states to decide the presidency, writes the NYT. As the NYT notes, when the national vote is tied, it is not a good omen for Democrats, as Trump did better in key states than nationally in the two previous elections, allowing him to win in 2016 without winning the national popular vote and narrowly losing to Joe Biden in 2020.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 02:55 PM\nSource:[Fanpage](https://www.fanpage.it/esteri/quando-ci-saranno-le-elezioni-usa-2024-la-data-e-cosa-dicono-gli-ultimi-sondaggi-sulla-sfida-trump-harris/)\n\n**The pragmatist's guide to the 2024 presidential election**\nThe 2024 presidential election will have a significant impact on various areas, including antitrust, broadband, and climate change.

Additionally, local elections will be held for mayors, councilors, prosecutors, judges, and other public offices. The Democratic and Republican parties are competing for the presidency, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump as the main candidates. The election will also determine 34 Senators and 435 Representatives, with 11 states holding gubernatorial elections. As of October 25, over 33 million people have already voted by mail or absentee ballot, with the top three states being Texas, Florida, and California. The Pew Research Center estimates that over 36 million Latinos are eligible to vote, with nine states being crucial for their vote. Seven 'swing' states, including Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, will be key in determining the outcome. However, it's worth noting that the popular vote does not determine the winner, but rather the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors. A candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. The election results will be projected on November 5, but the final decision will be made by the Electoral College in December. Some states require identification to vote, while others allow provisional ballots.

The two main candidates are Donald Trump from the Republican Party and Kamala Harris from the Democratic Party. The election process in the US is complex, with each state having a certain number of electoral votes. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes, which is 270 or more, is declared the winner. However, it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but not the electoral vote. The US presidential election is an indirect process, where citizens of the states and Washington D.C. vote for electors who then cast their electoral votes. The candidate who receives the majority of the electoral votes is declared the winner. If no candidate receives a majority, the House of Representatives chooses the president. In the US, most citizens who are 18 or older are eligible to vote. However, each state has its own voter registration process and deadlines. Citizens living abroad can register to vote using the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) and request an absentee ballot. In addition to the presidential election, voters will also be choosing new members of Congress. The results of the election will be announced on election night, but in some cases, it may take several days to count all the votes. If the president changes, there will be a transition period before the new administration takes office.

Shai Akabas, the executive director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said, 'Congress thrives on deadlines and operating at the last minute. When it comes to the debt limit, there is no definitive last minute because we don’t know exactly when that point will arrive, unlike a government shutdown.'

The elections will create uncertainty over how lawmakers will tackle challenges, and the fate of future Republican leadership will factor into legislative fights. Funding the government will take center stage in the lame-duck session, with a December 20 funding deadline. There are also growing calls for Congress to pass additional disaster relief in the wake of hurricanes Milton and Helene. The new Congress will have to confront the federal debt limit, which will be reinstated on January 2, a challenging and high-stakes issue. Shai Akabas, executive director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said, 'Congress thrives on deadlines and operating at the last minute, but when it comes to the debt limit, there is no definitive last minute because we don't know exactly when that point will arrive.' The US has never defaulted on its obligations, but fiscal conservatives and deficit hawks may try to force spending and budget cuts in exchange for addressing the debt limit. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2025 and the farm bill will also be major agenda items during the lame duck session.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 19, 2024 05:35 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/lawmakers-face-jam-packed-agenda-170048395.html)\n\n**RFEF Announces New Election Date for Presidency**\nThe Real Federación Española de Fútbol (RFEF) has announced that the elections for the presidency will take place on December 16, 2024. This new date comes after the Tribunal Administrativo del Deporte (TAD) annulled the original election process scheduled for October 7. The RFEF aims to 'conclude' this process before the end of 2024. According to María Ángeles García Chaves, vice president of the RFEF, the process for the election of the Assembly, Delegated Commission, and President for the 2024-2028 Olympic period has been initiated. The elections for the presidency and the delegated commission will be held on December 16, 2024, as per the approved electoral calendar. The RFEF is responding to the TAD's decision to annul the original election process, which was scheduled for October 7. The decision was made in response to a complaint filed by the president of CENAFE, Miguel Ángel Galán. The RFEF is also seeking to comply with the law and the FIFA's request for stability in the organization, as Spain is set to host the 2030 World Cup alongside Portugal and Morocco.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 18, 2024 03:53 PM\nSource:[theobjective.com](https://theobjective.com/deportes/2024-10-18/rfef-elecciones-presidencia-futbol-espana/)\n\n**Pozdnyakov Announces Elections for ROC President to Take Place Before End of 2024**\nAccording to Stanislav Pozdnyakov, President of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC), the elections for the new president of the ROC will take place before the end of 2024.

According to the Platform for National Transparency (PNT), there are at least 70 vacant positions for federal judges and magistrates that will be filled through popular vote next year. The Council of the Federal Judiciary (CJF) reported 15 vacancies for judges and 55 for magistrates. However, the CJF stated that the actual numbers may be higher, as there have been nearly 2,000 resignations and early retirements from the judiciary this year. The CJF has refused to provide the information to the Senate, with President Norma Piña Hernández citing 'bureaucratic responses' as the reason. Despite this, Sheinbaum assured that the reform will be implemented and the elections will take place in June 2025. The CJF reported 15 vacancies for judges in various states, including Campeche, Chiapas, Ciudad de México, Jalisco, Michoacán, Sonora, Tabasco, Tamaulipas, and Veracruz. Additionally, there are 55 vacancies for magistrates in various states, including Baja California, Baja California Sur, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Guanajuato, Guerrero, Jalisco, Colima, Oaxaca, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa, Sonora, Tabasco, Tamaulipas, Veracruz, San Luis Potosí, and Ciudad de México. Once the number of vacant positions is known, the Senate, the Executive Branch, and the Supreme Court will launch a call for candidates to register for the selection process.

Who is in the race?**\nThe 2024 US presidential election will be held on November 5, with former President Donald Trump running against US Vice President Kamala Harris. The election will also determine the members of the US Congress, with all 435 spots in the House of Representatives and 34 Senate seats up for grabs. The electoral college system governs presidential elections, with each state having a different number of electors. To win the presidency, a candidate must win 270 electoral votes. According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, 224 million Americans will be eligible to vote in 2024. The Pew Research Centre notes that the 2020 presidential election had a record turnout of 66% of the voting-eligible population, with nearly 155 million voters. The US does not have a federal counting process, and it can take weeks for the official tally to be released.

According to the White House press release, 'on Thursday, September 26, 2024, the President signed the bill' which provides 'appropriations for projects and activities of executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government through December 20, 2024'. The Senate and House of Representatives previously approved the document on Wednesday. The Biden administration had previously stated that it is necessary to extend the funding of the US government until December 20 and urges both chambers of Congress to pass the corresponding bill as soon as possible. This would prevent a costly and unnecessary shutdown of government funding and give time to pass the 2025 budget later this year, as stated in the administration's statement.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 26, 2024 09:03 PM\nSource:[ТАСС](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/21970557)\n\n**Opinion: Focus on the administration, not the candidate**\nAs the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, many Americans are unsure about which candidate to vote for. Dr. Jason Giersch, an associate political science professor at UNC Charlotte, suggests that voters focus on the administration, not just the candidate. According to Giersch, the administration, including the vice president and 15 executive department heads, has a significant impact on policy decisions. He notes that 'members of the administration have a voice and have influence, but they can't do much on their own.' Giersch emphasizes the importance of researching the roles of cabinet members and the success of previous administrations in areas such as national security, education, and healthcare. He also highlights the significance of cabinet positions, such as the Secretaries of Defense, Treasury, and State, in shaping the president's policies. By examining the achievements and setbacks of past administrative departments, voters can gain a better understanding of which candidate is more likely to appoint qualified and resilient individuals to key positions. As Giersch notes, 'sometimes, candidates pledge to add or remove cabinet positions or entire departments. Such a pledge is a pretty good signal as to what the federal government's role in that area will be if they are elected.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 02:30 PM\nSource:[Niner Times](https://www.ninertimes.com/opinion/opinion-focus-on-the-administration-not-the-candidate/article_a640e20c-76bd-11ef-9aca-d7692cbed98d.html)\n\n**US Congress Leaders Reach Agreement to Avoid Government Shutdown**\nThe leaders of the US Congress announced an agreement on Sunday to extend federal government funding until mid-December, avoiding a shutdown just weeks before the presidential elections.

A vote on a bill combining voting clauses with a six-month funding extension failed in the House of Representatives, controlled by Republicans, on Wednesday. Republicans have been demanding that any funding extension be tied to new requirements for voters to prove their American citizenship, a pressure motivated by Donald Trump's unfounded allegations of widespread election fraud. The announced agreement excludes voting clauses and extends funding only until December 20, delaying the debate on the topic until well after the November 5 elections, in which the control of the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the US Presidency will be decided by a narrow margin.

The election will be a complex process, with four candidates competing for the presidency: Kamala Harris, Donald Trump, Jill Stein, and Chase Oliver. The election will be decided by the Electoral College, with 538 electors choosing the president. Each state has its own system for selecting electors, with some states using a winner-takes-all approach and others using a proportional system. The election will also feature a decentralized process, with each state and local government responsible for managing the election. The certification of the vote will take place at the state level, with the secretary of state or governor certifying the results. The Electoral Count Act of 1877 provides a five-week period for states to resolve any disputes and allow electors to meet on December 17. The votes will be officially counted on January 6, 2025, during a joint session of Congress. The winner of the election will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025.

The election is expected to be closely contested, with several key states, including Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, playing a crucial role in determining the outcome.

According to Pacheco, the sanction 'closes a long path of maturation of discussions between the government and the National Congress on the theme'. President Lula sanctioned the law with four vetoes. The law, approved by the National Congress last week, is the result of many negotiations between the federal government and the Legislature. Pacheco highlighted that 'the consensus achieved represents a very favorable solution for the economic sectors and, above all, for the Brazilian municipalities, which will now have a very relevant measure to balance public accounts.' The text sanctioned by Lula maintains the total desoneration until December 2024, starting the gradual reoneration process from 2025 until 2027. In 2028, the reoneration will return totally. The points vetoed by the head of the Executive were pointed out by the AGU (Advocacia-Geral da União) and the Ministry of Finance. One of the points vetoed was the deadline for claiming forgotten resources in financial institutions. According to the text that left the Congress, the values could be claimed until December 31, 2027. But, with the veto, the value can be claimed in up to 30 days from this Monday.
