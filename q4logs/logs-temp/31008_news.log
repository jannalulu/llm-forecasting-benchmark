**Cold front to sweep dense fog, rain out of Houston. What's next?**
A cold front is expected to sweep dense fog and rain out of Houston, bringing southeasterly winds that could lead to stray showers along and south of Interstate 10, especially on Christmas Day.

According to Justin Ballard, the Houston Chronicle's new newsroom meteorologist, 'His unique experience in forecasting will serve him well in his role at the Chronicle, as Houston has experienced a number of impactful weather events in recent years.' Ballard, a North Carolina native, brings five years of experience forecasting tropical systems, severe weather outbreaks, and blizzards to the Houston Chronicle.

Recent rain in Houston has eased the drought in the area, with widespread rainfall totals of 2-5 inches observed across Southeast Texas in the first eight days of November.
