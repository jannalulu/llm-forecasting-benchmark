BYD is likely to top 4 million sales for 2024, including hybrids. The company is set to launch its next-gen Blade battery in 2025, which will last longer and improve vehicle driving range. Meanwhile, Li Auto, Nio, XPeng, and Zeekr are also due to release their November EV sales, following a robust October for China EV sales. BYD's huge size and massive in-house operations give it strong leverage over suppliers, and the company has avoided new incentives in recent months amid strong orders. However, Li Auto and Tesla have announced recent China discounts and other incentives. The China EV price war is expected to continue in 2025, with BYD signaling a brutal two-year price war won't let up.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 29, 2024 08:00 PM\nSource:[biztoc.com](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-rival-byd-li-auto-nio-xpeng-zeekr-china-ev-sales/?ref=biztoc.com)\n\n**Tesla Stock Finished Black Friday on a High Note**\nTesla's stock finished Black Friday up 3.7%, leaving it nearly 40% ahead for the year, with a market capitalization of around $1.07 trillion. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives maintained an outperform rating and a $400 target price on the stock, citing the incoming Trump administration's potential to clear the way for Tesla's self-driving car and artificial intelligence aspirations. Ives believes a formal federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles would be a significant tailwind for Tesla, potentially worth $1 trillion to its market value, and predicts the stock could reach $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion in value over the next 12 to 18 months. 'The next step the Street awaits is a formal federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles as one of the Transportation Department's first key priorities,' Ives wrote. 'This would be a huge step forward in easing US rules for self-driving cars and be a significant tailwind for Tesla's autonomous and AI vision heading into 2025.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 29, 2024 07:16 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

This improvement is part of Tesla's efforts to streamline operations and enhance supplier relationships. Meanwhile, Tesla has revamped its referral program across North America, offering enhanced discounts and rewards, including specific incentives for the Cybertruck. The company has also started offering unlimited overnight charging via the Tesla Electric service, down from $15 a month, and is offering discounts of up to $4,000 on select Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to boost fourth-quarter deliveries. Despite these efforts, analysts predict that Tesla's fourth-quarter deliveries will set new records but may not prevent a yearly sales decline, due to the potential removal of the $7,500 EV tax credit by the incoming Trump administration, as warned by Gary Black. Tesla shares are trading higher by 2.51% to $341.18 at publication Friday.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 29, 2024 03:47 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/news/global/24/11/42245925/tesla-china-shortens-payment-cycle-to-90-days-in-2024-report)\n\n**Ideal Automobile Launches Year-End 0-Interest Policy, Covers Entire Model Range**\nIdeal Automobile has announced a year-end 0-interest policy, which will be in effect from November 29, 2024 to December 31, 2024. Customers who purchase Ideal L-series or Ideal MEGA models during this period can enjoy a 3-year 0-interest scheme, with a minimum down payment of 6.98 yuan. In addition to the 3-year 0-interest policy, customers can also choose a 5-year loan with an interest rate of 0.99%, which is equivalent to an approximate annual interest rate of 1.92%. This move marks the start of the year-end sales battle, with Tesla also offering a payment discount of 1,000 yuan for customers who pay the full amount by December 31. According to public information, Ideal Automobile delivered 51,443 new cars in October, a year-on-year increase of 27.3%.

In China, the Model Y was the best-selling model from January to September. In Europe, the Model Y was the best-selling car in September. In Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Switzerland, the Model Y was the best-selling car of the year. In the US, the Model Y, Model 3, and Cybertruck were among the top three best-selling electric vehicles in the third quarter. Elon Musk said, 'We expect Tesla's electric vehicle deliveries to increase by 20-30% in 2025. We believe that clean electric vehicles are the best choice for consumers.' Additionally, Tesla rolled out its 7 millionth vehicle worldwide on October 22 and its 1 millionth Model Y from the Fremont factory on October 27.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 10:55 AM\nSource:[iXBT.com](https://www.ixbt.com/news/2024/10/28/mirovye-prodazhi-jelektromobilej-padajut-no-tesla-jeto-ne-kasaetsja-kompanija-ustanovila-novyj-rekord.html)\n\n**Tesla Shares Surge on Delivery Forecast. Is It Time to Buy the Stock?**\nTesla's stock surged after its third-quarter earnings report, with shares recouping negative returns from the first half of 2024. Deliveries increased by 6% in Q3, with Model 3/Y deliveries rising 5% to 43,668 vehicles and other models seeing a 43% spike to 22,915 vehicles. Total vehicle production climbed 9% to 469,796. Tesla's automotive revenue edged up 2% to $20 billion, driven by a 33% surge in automobile regulatory credit revenue. The company's overall gross margins jumped 195 basis points to 19.8%. Looking ahead, CEO Elon Musk said his 'best guess' is that the company would increase deliveries by 20% to 30% next year, powered by more affordable models starting in the first half of 2025. However, Musk did not provide details on these models. 'Preparations are being made to begin launching them,' he said. 'We're very optimistic about 2025,' Musk added. 'We think we can deliver a lot more vehicles than we did this year.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2024 04:12 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The company's third-quarter results showed a record number of vehicle deliveries and the second-highest regulatory credit revenue. Excluding credits, Tesla's profit margin on vehicle sales increased to 17.05%, surpassing the 14.9% margin expected by analysts. The company also noted a significant decrease in the cost of goods sold per vehicle, with a total of $35,100, the lowest level in history. The decline in the prices of materials used in EV batteries was cited as a contributing factor to the reduced costs, but it was also noted that the benefits of these savings would gradually decrease. Despite a 2% decline in the stock price during the regular trading session, the after-hours surge added approximately $50 billion to Tesla's market value. Tesla previously announced in October that deliveries in September had increased by more than 6% compared to the previous year, indicating a recovery after the decline in the first half of the year. Last year, Tesla had implemented strategic price cuts that led to a sharp decline in profit margins. However, this year the company has focused on offering more favorable financing options and discounts, which analysts believe will help stabilize margins in the future. Additionally, Tesla has recently introduced new products such as the Cybercab robotaxi and a 20-person autonomous minibus, as part of its efforts to advance autonomous driving technology. The company's third-quarter revenue was $25.18 billion, slightly below the $25.37 billion predicted by LSEG, but an increase from the $23.35 billion in the same period of 2023. The adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was 72 cents, exceeding the 58 cent consensus estimate. The company's general profit margin for the July-September quarter was 19.8%, surpassing the 17.3% estimate by LSEG analysts and exceeding the 18% margin in the second quarter. 'We are committed to expanding our product lineup, reducing costs, and investing in artificial intelligence (AI) projects and production capacity,' said Tesla. 'Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong results.' \nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 10:15 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Türkiye](https://tr.investing.com/news/economy-news/tesla-2024te-mutevaz-teslimat-buyumesi-ongoruyor-karlar-beklentileri-asyor-93CH-3103970)\n\n**Tesla Exceeds Expectations, Projects Slight Growth in Deliveries for 2024**\nTesla exceeded Wall Street's earnings estimates for the third quarter and projected a slight increase in deliveries for the current year, reflecting a surge in demand for its electric vehicles. The company reported adjusted earnings of 72 cents per share for the quarter, above the average analyst estimate. Tesla reiterated its plans to start producing more affordable models in the first half of 2025 and said it expects a 50% growth next year compared to its 2023 production volumes. Tesla's shares rose 9.9% in after-hours trading on Wednesday, after closing regular trading down 14% for the year. 'Despite current macroeconomic conditions, we expect a slight growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024,' Tesla said in a statement. The company said it expects another solid quarter in terms of deliveries after a record third quarter, and said it anticipates higher volumes for the full year. However, it will not be easy, given the slowdown in deliveries Tesla recorded in the first half of the year, and the automaker will need to significantly increase sales in the fourth quarter to surpass or match 2023 sales. Tesla's Cybertruck, which was first delivered at the end of last year, achieved profitability for the first time, thanks in part to increases in production of the futuristic pickup truck. The company's automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits, was 17.1% in the third quarter, a significant increase from the previous quarter, when it was 14.6%.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 09:51 PM\nSource:[El Financiero](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/empresas/2024/10/23/tesla-supera-las-expectativas-registra-un-trimestre-espectacular-gracias-a-fuertes-ventas/)\n\n**Tesla (TSLA) predicts a record Q4, stock jumps 8%**\nTesla (TSLA) has predicted a record fourth quarter, with a 6% increase in deliveries year-over-year and an 11% increase quarter-to-quarter, according to its Q3 2024 financial results. The automaker's stock jumped 8% in aftermarket trading, not due to higher-than-expected profits, but because Tesla released guidance for Q4, which is rare. The company expects to deliver 515,000 vehicles in Q4, which would be a significant increase from the previous quarter. As reported earlier this week, Tesla is already offering deep discounts to boost sales early in the quarter. 'Considering we know how many vehicles deployed last year and how many it did so far this, we know exactly how many vehicles it needs to deliver in Q4 to still manage to achieve growth in 2024,' said Tesla, in a statement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 08:44 PM\nSource:[Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/10/23/tesla-tsla-predicts-a-record-q4-stock-jumps-8/)\n\n**Tesla Q3 2024 Earnings: Will Results Exceed Expectations?**\nInvestors are awaiting Tesla's third-quarter 2024 report, which is expected to be released after market close. The company delivered 462,890 vehicles, a 6.4% increase from last year. Although this number is below Wall Street's expectations, it marks the first annual increase in deliveries in 2024, following two quarters of decline. Analysts predict revenues of $25.4 billion, an 8% increase from last year, with earnings per share estimated at $0.59. Tesla's deliveries have increased due to incentives and new models, with China remaining a key driver, supported by subsidies, and the US seeing a boost from the Cybertruck and favorable financing options. However, supply chain pressures and declining energy storage sales are hindering the company's goal of 50% growth. Additionally, a lack of charging stations and declining resale values may deter some buyers, as the electric vehicle market appears to be plateauing with decreasing demand.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 02:16 PM\nSource:[Investing.com France](https://fr.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tesla-vatelle-voir-des-resultats-du-t3-audessus-des-attentes--2610595)\n\n**Tesla Goes All-In On Q4 Vehicle Deliveries With Latest Round Of Incentives**\nTesla has increased U.S. inventory discounts by up to $4,000 on certain Model Y and Model 3 vehicles and is now offering 0% financing for up to 60 months on these models without requiring the purchase of full self-driving. The company aims to deliver 1.8 million vehicles globally in 2024, which would require a record-breaking fourth quarter. Analysts predict Q4 deliveries to reach 487,000, with a total of 1.78 million deliveries in 2024. Despite this, Tesla's stock has dropped 0.7% to $217.23 on Tuesday, following a 0.8% decline on Monday.

This was a 'mini step in the right direction' according to analysts at Wedbush Securities, but they noted that 'more heavy lifting is clearly ahead' as Tesla faces challenges in reaching its 1.8 million sales target for 2024. Despite the rise, shares fell around 3.8% in early trading, and the company will need a record fourth quarter to avoid its first annual fall in deliveries.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2024 07:28 AM\nSource:[expressdigest.com](https://expressdigest.com/electric-shock-as-tesla-faces-its-first-fall-in-annual-car-deliveries/)\n\n**Tesla's Quarterly Sales Increase, But Fall Short of Analysts' Expectations**\nTesla Inc. reported a 6.4% increase in quarterly vehicle sales this year, but fell short of analysts' expectations. The company delivered 462,890 vehicles to customers in the last three months, a slight improvement from the same period last year. However, the sales did not meet the 463,900 units predicted by analysts. 'We will see some pressure on the stock today, as investor expectations diverge from delivery numbers,' wrote Daniel Ives, Wedbush analyst, in a report. Tesla's stock price dropped 6.4% to $10:30 a.m. in New York. The company received a boost during the quarter due to China's doubling of an incentive for consumers to trade in old cars for electric models, which fueled demand in the world's largest electric vehicle market. This optimism was also fueled by the upcoming event on October 10 near Los Angeles, where Elon Musk will present prototypes of self-driving vehicles. 'It will be a historic event,' Musk wrote on X last week. Tesla's stock has had a tumultuous 2024, recovering from a decline of over 40% in mid-April, largely due to the anticipation of Musk's long-promised robotaxis. The company started the year warning that it might expand at a notably slower pace until it begins producing cheaper models in the first half of 2025. Tesla needs a strong performance in the coming months to grow in 2024, as deliveries fell more than 2% in the first nine months of the year.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 05:45 PM\nSource:[Infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/agencias/2024/10/02/primer-aumento-de-ventas-trimestrales-de-tesla-de-este-ano-no-fue-suficiente)\n\n**Tesla posts quarterly increase in deliveries, but falls short of expectations**\nTesla's quarterly vehicle deliveries rose by 6.4% to 462,890 vehicles, according to the company's third-quarter delivery numbers. While this increase is a welcome sign for the company, investors were underwhelmed as the results were more or less in line with analysts' expectations. Tesla sales fell early in 2024 due to increased competition in the electric vehicle market, but a Chinese government incentive program helped boost sales this quarter. Analyst Dan Ives described the deliveries as 'good and a step in the right direction,' but cautioned that there would be pressure on the company's stock due to investors' high expectations. Ives stated, 'Overall, this is a clear improvement from the first half and we believe getting in the range of 1.8 million for the year is still the key and important bogey.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 05:39 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-posts-quarterly-increase-deliveries-173938268.html)\n\n**Tesla Missed Its Quarterly Delivery Target Again**\nTesla has missed its quarterly delivery target for the third time this year, handing over 462,890 vehicles in Q3 2024, a 6.4% increase from July to September, but short of analysts' estimates of 470,000 vehicles. The company's sales are at risk of declining for the first time in its history, as more competition emerges in China and Europe. To maintain its 2023 delivery level, Tesla would need to deliver a record-breaking 516,344 vehicles in the fourth quarter, which seems unlikely. The majority of Q3 deliveries were Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossovers, with 443,668 units built and 439,975 delivered. Tesla will release its full Q3 financial report on October 23, and the company's Robotaxi reveal on October 10 could be a crucial turning point for the company's success.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 05:20 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://autos.yahoo.com/tesla-missed-quarterly-delivery-target-172000961.html)\n\n**Tesla Fails to Meet Expectations with Third Quarter Delivery Data**\nTesla released its vehicle production and delivery data for the third quarter of 2024. According to the data, the company produced 469,796 vehicles in the third quarter of 2024, up from 430,488 in the same period last year. The number of vehicles delivered by Tesla in the third quarter of 2024 also increased by 6.4% year-over-year to 462,890. However, this fell short of market expectations of 463,310 deliveries. Tesla's stock price declined by more than 3% after the disappointing delivery data. 'The company's inability to meet expectations is a concern for investors,' said an analyst. 'Tesla's growth has been slowing down, and this data suggests that the company is facing challenges in meeting its production targets.'\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 04:21 PM\nSource:[Habertürk](https://www.haberturk.com/tesla-beklentileri-karsilayamadi-3725147-ekonomi)\n\n**Tesla Misses Delivery Expectations in Q3 Amid Increased Competition**\nTesla fell short of delivery expectations in the third quarter due to increased competition, causing its stock to drop in New York. The electric vehicle manufacturer delivered 462,890 vehicles in the three months leading up to September 30, a 6.4% increase from the previous quarter. However, analysts predicted that the company, led by Elon Musk, would deliver 469,828 vehicles during the period. Tesla's stock lost 4.95% of its value at 2:40 PM GMT. To meet its annual delivery target of 1.81 million units in 2023, Tesla must deliver a record 516,344 vehicles in the fourth quarter. If this target is not met, the company will experience its first annual decline in deliveries. Tesla faces increased competition in the US, reduced European subsidies, and slowing consumer spending in China, the world's largest car market, where local players are rapidly growing.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 03:49 PM\nSource:[boursier.com](https://www.boursier.com/actualites/reuters/tesla-manque-les-attentes-de-livraisons-au-t3-face-a-la-concurrence-377821.html)\n\n**Tesla Registers 1st Quarterly Delivery Increase This Year, Surprising Market**\nTesla reported a 6% increase in electric vehicle deliveries in the third quarter of this year, compared to the same period in 2023.

The company delivered 439,975 compact Model 3 and SUV Model Y vehicles between April and June, surpassing the 436,000 expected by analysts, according to estimates compiled by FactSet. This represents an improvement compared to the previous year, when Tesla delivered 435,059 vehicles. Tesla also delivered 22,915 electric vehicles more than expected, a 43% increase year-over-year. Although the company does not provide a breakdown of those deliveries, they include the SUV crossover Model X, the sedan Model S, and the Cybertruck, a electric pickup truck launched by Tesla in November last year that recently became the best-selling vehicle over $100,000. In total, Tesla delivered 462,890 electric vehicles to customers in the last quarter, a 6% increase compared to the 435,059 units delivered in the third quarter of 2023. Wall Street expected deliveries of around 462,000 units, according to FactSet estimates. The company also manufactured 443,668 units of the Model Y and Model 3, as well as 26,128 units of all other models. This totals 469,796 units, compared to the 435,059 units manufactured in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in sales comes after Tesla introduced a series of incentives in China in the midst of growing competition, declining spending, and economic growth. This has included interest-free loans of up to five years and discounts on paint selections. Sales also benefited from Beijing's initiative to provide subsidies for electric vehicles and the Model Y approved for government purchases. Tesla will hold its third-quarter earnings conference call on October 16, just under a week after the highly anticipated presentation of the robotaxi event, which was delayed after CEO Elon Musk demanded 'a significant design change'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 01:15 PM\nSource:[Quartz](https://es.qz.com/tesla-q3-ventas-modelos-ev-elon-musk-robotaxi-stock-1851662961)\n\n**Tesla Sees Significant Increase in Deliveries in Q3 2024**\nTesla has seen a significant increase in deliveries in the third quarter of 2024.

This would be a significant improvement from the 430,488 vehicles produced and 435,059 delivered in the same quarter last year. According to Wells Fargo analysts, Tesla is expected to deliver 1.63 million vehicles for the year, with 440,000 units delivered in the third quarter. Goldman Sachs analysts believe that Tesla's position on the Chinese market is still strong enough to increase sales. 'The return to positive dynamics should have a positive impact on investor sentiment,' said analysts.

The total net worth of the top 10 richest people increased by approximately $5850 billion. The increase in wealth is largely due to the surge in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, with companies such as Tesla, Oracle, and Nvidia experiencing significant growth. Musk's wealth has increased by $1190 billion, largely due to the success of Tesla's autonomous driving and robotics technology, as well as the boost in Tesla's stock price. Oracle's Larry Ellison has seen his net worth increase by $832 billion, thanks to his ownership of approximately 40% of Oracle's cloud business. Nvidia's Jensen Huang has seen his net worth increase by $800 billion, thanks to the company's strong performance in the AI chip market. Other notable individuals on the list include Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Michael Dell, who have all seen significant increases in their net worth due to their investments in AI.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 30, 2024 01:41 AM\nSource:[Udnemoney聯合理財網           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5599/8394534)\n\n**Wall Street Marks Its Best Month of the Year So Far**\nUS stocks ended the month on a high note, marking the best month of the year so far.

Chinese stocks also rallied, with the CSI 300 Index jumping as much as 2.3% on Friday, driven by expectations of greater economic support at a key policy meeting in December. 'Earnings growth forecasts for 2025 in the US remain optimistic, at around 15%,' said Davies.

According to a statement from the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the leaders support the idea of this type of tax without providing a clear plan for its implementation or a specific start date. The statement said, 'We will strive, in full respect for fiscal sovereignty, to engage in a collaborative manner to ensure the effective taxation of the wealthiest individuals.' Brazilian President Lula da Silva has previously called for the implementation of this type of tax on the wealthiest individuals, which was included in the joint statement despite Argentina's opposition. Brazil had previously proposed a plan that would require billionaires to pay 2% of their assets in annual taxes, generating $250 billion in revenue that could be used to combat hunger, conflicts, and pandemics, as well as protect the environment. Such a tax would affect around 3,000 people worldwide, according to Bloomberg's billionaire index, including around 100 in Latin America. Elon Musk, the world's richest man with an estimated $330 billion, is set to take on a new role as chairman of the US government's efficiency committee in January 2025. Economies led by female leaders, such as the UK, France, Switzerland, and the US under President Joe Biden, are considering taxing the wealthy amid financial challenges. According to a Forbes article in October 2024, the combined wealth of the world's top 10 individuals is around $1.75 trillion, a $85 billion increase from June 2024. G20 finance ministers announced in July 2024 that 'inequality in wealth and income undermines economic growth and social cohesion, and exacerbates social vulnerabilities.' In the context, Reuters reported that Biden pledged a $4 billion contribution to the International Development Association, a fund managed by the World Bank, to help the world's poorest countries. Biden announced the US commitment in a closed session of the G20 summit. The amount is a record, exceeding the $3.5 billion pledged by Washington in the previous round of boosting the fund's resources in December 2021.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 08:48 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/ebusiness/2024/11/19/%d9%85%d8%ac%d9%85%d9%88%d8%b9%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b9%d8%b4%d8%b1%d9%8a%d9%86-%d8%aa%d8%af%d8%b9%d9%88-%d9%84%d9%81%d8%b1%d8%b6-%d8%b6%d8%b1%d9%8a%d8%a8%d8%a9-%d8%b9%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d9%8a%d8%a9)\n\n**The Role of Billionaires in the US Presidential Election**\nThe article discusses the role of billionaires in the US presidential election, focusing on their donations to the campaigns of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. According to Bloomberg, the 48 richest people in the US, with a combined wealth of over $1.006 trillion, donated at least $407 million to both Democrats and Republicans. However, some billionaires, such as Charles Koch, Rupert Murdoch, and Mark Zuckerberg, chose not to publicly disclose their donations. The article highlights the differences in donation patterns between Democrats and Republicans, with Democrats receiving more donations from women and Republicans receiving more donations from men. The article also notes that the richest donors tend to be more generous to their preferred candidates, with a median donation of 0.012% of their wealth for Republican donors and 0.007% for Democratic donors. The article also discusses the influence of billionaires on the election, with some, such as Warren Buffett, publicly supporting or opposing candidates. However, Buffett's decision to remain neutral in the 2020 election and his subsequent statement that he would not support or oppose any candidates in the future, suggests that he may have been motivated by a desire to avoid taking a stance that could harm his business interests. The article also notes that the market's reaction to the election results was significant, with the S&P 500 index rising 4.9% in the first week of the election, and some companies, such as Tesla and Las Vegas Sands, experiencing significant gains. However, the article also notes that the market's reaction was not uniform, with some companies, such as Berkshire Hathaway, experiencing losses. The article concludes by noting that the influence of billionaires on the election is a complex issue, and that their donations and actions can have significant consequences for the outcome of the election.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 08:50 PM\nSource:[Ambito](https://www.ambito.com/negocios/los-grandes-muy-grandes-perdedores-la-victoria-donald-trump-soros-bloomberg-buffet-n6080742)\n\n**The Bloomberg Billionaires Index is a daily ranking of the world's richest people.

The collective gain of the top 10 richest people is attributed to the surge in net worth following Trump's win, despite some of them, including Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, not endorsing a candidate this year.

The gain was the largest daily increase in the Bloomberg Wealth Index since its inception in 2012. The surge in the wealth of the world's richest people is partly due to the rise in American stock prices, which is seen as a reflection of the expected policies of Donald Trump, who is expected to implement lower taxes and reduced regulations as president. The S&P 500 index rose 2.5% to its best post-election performance, and the US dollar also strengthened.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 01:53 PM\nSource:[haber7.com](https://ekonomi.haber7.com/ekonomi/haber/3476613-trumpin-kazanmasi-en-cok-onlara-yaradi-bir-gunde-servet-kazandilar)\n\n**World's Richest People See Record Gains After Trump's Victory**\nThe world's 10 richest people saw a record gain of $64 billion in combined wealth after Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

James Pethokoukis, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said, 'If we look at the list of the richest Americans, whether it's Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, the reason why people become super rich is because they create a company and make it grow.' John Sabelhaus, a member of the Brookings Institution, stated, 'The inequality of wealth is very conditioned by the prices of different types of assets. One of the factors that will cause wealth inequality to increase, measured in terms of the concentration of wealth, is the stock market.'

This group includes only three tech leaders: Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, and Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla.

The measure, proposed by Kind Idaho, would decriminalize personal use and cultivation of marijuana for adults aged 21 and older. It would allow for the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana flower or 1,000 milligrams of THC in products, as well as home cultivation of up to 12 plants. Signature collection must be completed by April 2026, with volunteers already active in several counties. The measure explicitly exempts these activities from penalties under Idaho's Uniform Controlled Substances Act and Illegal Drug Stamp Tax Act, provided they meet specified conditions.

Denise Pollicella, a cannabis attorney, notes that rescheduling is not just about new retail partnerships, but about overhauling how cannabis businesses operate, adapting to FDA oversight, meeting pharmaceutical-grade standards, and navigating stricter compliance requirements. Pollicella anticipates a system similar to the 2018 hemp legalization framework, where states submit regulatory schemes to meet federal guidelines. She also warns that rescheduling is far from guaranteed and that substantial lobbying will likely be needed to make progress. Despite the challenges, Pollicella is optimistic about the industry's potential under a rescheduled framework, believing that businesses with scalable production capabilities and strategic foresight will thrive.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 28, 2024 05:48 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/government/regulations/24/11/42235292/pharma-grade-cannabis-could-hit-walgreens-cvs-but-can-the-industry-survive-the-fda)\n\n**State announces intent to award 22 new medical marijuana licenses**\nThe state of Florida has announced its intention to award 22 new medical marijuana licenses, nearly 18 months after the applications were submitted.

The letter noted that the transition would not address the gap between federal and state cannabis policy, and that more action was needed to resolve the harms of criminalization. The lawmakers urged Biden to issue another round of clemency and an updated memorandum on prosecutorial discretion for marijuana offenses, and to encourage state governors to expand marijuana clemency and decriminalize low-level marijuana conduct under state law.

This means that possessing, growing, transporting, or distributing marijuana is a federal felony, with violations resulting in fines and/or imprisonment. Even in states that have legalized marijuana, there are many government rules and regulations that limit the freedom of marijuana users. Libertarians believe in real marijuana freedom, where there should be no rules or restrictions on the buying, selling, possessing, growing, processing, transporting, advertising, using, delivering, or 'trafficking' of marijuana.

However, despite this growth, fewer than 10% of all financial institutions in the U.S. provide services to the cannabis industry. The ongoing hesitation among banks stems from federal law, which classifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance, posing significant legal risks for banks. According to NORML, the lack of clear federal guidelines continues to deter many banks, exacerbating the challenges faced by cannabis businesses in securing banking services and investment capital. Paul Armentano, NORML deputy director, said, 'No industry can operate safely, transparently, or effectively without access to banks or other financial institutions.' The absence of comprehensive banking reform disproportionately impacts smaller and minority-owned cannabis businesses, which often rely on traditional financing to grow and operate. The SAFER Banking Act remains a key focus for cannabis advocates, who argue that it would provide the much-needed clarity and legal protection for financial institutions willing to work with the industry.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 06:36 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/11/42015861/treasury-report-over-800-banks-partnered-with-cannabis-companies-in-2023-despite-federal-hurdles)\n\n**Marijuana stakeholders walk fine line to join rescheduling hearing**\nThe US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has invited 25 stakeholders to participate in a hearing about rescheduling marijuana from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 of the Controlled Substances Act.

The NCIA's filing argues that rescheduling would lift restrictions on novel cannabinoids, while The Commonwealth Project's filing notes that rescheduling without regulations would negatively affect individuals 65 and older.

While reclassification would make it easier for scientists to research cannabis' benefits and allow businesses to claim more credits, it would not federally legalize the drug. Currently, 24 states have legalized recreational cannabis, 15 states allow medical use with varying restrictions, and 11 states have not legalized cannabis for either use.

This proposal would complement the Biden administration's initiative to reclassify marijuana as a low-risk substance. Harris wrote on X, 'I will legalize recreational marijuana, break down unjust legal barriers, and create opportunities for all Americans to succeed in this new industry.' The initiative would need to pass through Congress, where it would require negotiations with Republicans or a budget reconciliation process. The US market for legal cannabis is estimated to be worth $32 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Harris had previously mentioned the possibility of promoting the cannabis industry in October, when she promised to 'boost a national cannabis industry.' The Biden administration has also initiated the process of reclassifying marijuana from a restricted substance (Schedule I) to a low-risk substance (Schedule III). This reclassification would change the way marijuana is classified under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which establishes the federal policy on drugs. The DEA explains, 'Substances, chemicals, and certain products used to manufacture substances are classified into five distinct categories or lists based on the acceptable medical use of the substance and the potential for abuse or dependence. The abuse index is a determining factor in the classification of the substance; for example, substances on Schedule I have a high potential for abuse and creating severe psychological and/or physical dependence.

Critics argue that the decision was not properly researched and is driven by popularity rather than science. However, proponents argue that marijuana has accepted medical use and that rescheduling would legitimize its use as a medicine. They also point out that Schedule III includes dronabinol, a synthetic version of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. Rescheduling could also open up new opportunities for medical research into marijuana's effects. However, opponents cite possible health risks associated with marijuana consumption, including addiction and increased risk of schizophrenia. Despite these risks, research shows that marijuana use can have many benefits, including pain management, reduced dependency on opioids, and potential prevention of Alzheimer's and Type 2 diabetes.

However, this information is unfounded and originated from a satirical Facebook page. The page, SpaceX Fanclub, is known for its satirical content and posted the false narrative on September 17, 2024. The story was spread through various articles and social media platforms, but there is no evidence that Elon Musk ever asked the public to boycott ABC. As stated on the original Facebook post, 'Pubblichiamo SATIRA, niente su questa pagina è reale' (We publish SATIRE, nothing on this page is real) and 'SATIRA VALUTATA' (SATIRICAL CONTENT) are clearly indicated. Politifact also confirmed that there is no evidence of Elon Musk asking for a boycott of ABC. 'It's a classic case of misinformation,' said no one, as the story was spread through disinformation websites and social media pages.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 30, 2024 12:41 AM\nSource:[open.online](https://www.open.online/2024/11/30/rete-televisiva-abc-non-ha-perso-un-milione-abbonati-per-colpa-di-elon-musk-fc/)\n\n**Elon Musk Considers Starship Landing a Success, Despite Mechazilla Failure**\nElon Musk considers the landing of Starship a 'success' and says they will try to catch the ship with Mechazilla soon. During the sixth test flight of the Starship system on November 19, SpaceX achieved several technical milestones, including a maneuver, the ignition of one of six Raptor engines, and controlled atmospheric re-entry. However, the Super Heavy rocket landed in the Gulf of Mexico instead of being caught by Mechazilla. Musk believes that 'the capture would have worked anyway' despite the decision to abort the capture due to a loss of communication with the launch tower computer. This statement raises questions about the decision made by SpaceX, as the engineers stated that they did not meet the 'compromise criterion' because many factors were not working correctly. Musk adds that they 'opted for caution' because they were not sure. SpaceX aims to make its rockets completely reusable thanks to Mechazilla's mechanics, but how does it work? The tower is equipped with two mechanical arms that act as a capture system. After launching a rocket, Mechazilla remains in standby while the rocket completes its mission, and then the arms adjust to the spacecraft's trajectory and proceed to catch it using their motors and flaps. This system is crucial for reducing the costs of space missions, avoiding ocean landings, facilitating the transportation of large loads, saving time, and reducing the wear and tear on the rocket's stages.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 29, 2024 06:14 AM\nSource:[20 minutos](https://www.20minutos.es/tecnologia/actualidad/elon-musk-desvela-por-que-mechazilla-fallo-capturar-cohete-super-heavy-sexto-vuelo-starship-5658885/)\n\n**SpaceX's Starship Completes Sixth Test Flight, Despite Aborted Maneuver**\nElon Musk's SpaceX Starship has completed its sixth test flight, reaching an altitude of nearly 200 kilometers and speeds of over 25,000 km/h. The second stage of the rocket landed successfully in the Indian Ocean after a planned and controlled descent. During the test flight, a prominent guest was present - former US President Donald Trump, accompanied by his 17-year-old granddaughter Kai Trump. Kai Trump shared exclusive behind-the-scenes photos and videos of the SpaceX launch on her blog. The test flight was initially planned to include a spectacular maneuver where mechanical arms would catch the rocket's engine in mid-air, but the mission was aborted after four minutes due to concerns about the launch tower. Musk explained to Trump, 'We had some concerns about the tower, so we decided to land it in the sea.' Trump replied, 'That's amazing.' He then asked, 'Can we use it again? Can we retrieve it from the sea?' Musk hesitated and replied, 'Ah, it will... it will... it will probably explode. That's my guess.' The interaction between Musk and Trump was described as 'cringe-worthy' by The Daily Beast. Despite the setback, SpaceX announced plans to conduct another ocean landing of the Starship and attempt to catch it with the launch tower. The company highlighted the success of the test flight, which exceeded the rocket's original stress limit and successfully restarted one of its engines, a crucial step for future missions to the Moon or Mars.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 28, 2024 09:12 PM\nSource:[Merkur.de](https://www.merkur.de/politik/trump-entsetzen-blick-elon-musk-beim-spacex-start-rakete-zr-93439730.html)\n\n**Weltraum-Highlights 2024 and Future Missions 2025**\nThe latest episode of 'Space Night science' looks back at the top space stories of 2024 and previews the exciting missions to come in 2025, including new telescopes and a return to the moon.

Following the sixth flight, SpaceX founder Elon Musk stated that the next mission will continue to attempt sea landing, and if successful, the company will attempt to use the launch tower to catch the spacecraft. From a long-term perspective, SpaceX aims to make the launch tower capture technology a standard operation to achieve rapid reuse of two-stage rockets. This strategy not only showcases SpaceX's technological innovation but also plays a crucial role in promoting space commercialization. Musk also revealed that SpaceX plans to launch 25 Starships in 2025 and aims to increase the number of annual launches to an astonishing 100 in the following years. Additionally, SpaceX is expected to launch multiple unmanned Starships to Mars within two years. If these unmanned missions are successful, humans may witness the launch of manned spacecraft to Mars in the near future. Furthermore, SpaceX is aggressively pushing forward with production line construction at Starfactory. Once the production line is fully mature, SpaceX will be able to produce a new second-stage body every eight hours. Moreover, the new-generation rockets, Starship 2 and Starship 3, will have the capability to carry over 100 tons and 200 tons of payload into orbit, respectively, which will be a significant milestone for establishing self-sufficient cities on Mars.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 25, 2024 11:36 AM\nSource:[驱动之家](https://news.mydrivers.com/1/1015/1015874.htm)\n\n**SpaceX's Starship Flight 7 Launch May Take Place on January 11, 2025 | 🔬 LatestLY**\nSpaceX is planning to launch the Starship Flight 7 test flight as early as January 11, 2025, according to DogeDesigner and Sawyer Merritt.

According to Elon Musk, the head of SpaceX, a malfunction occurred on the ground infrastructure, not on the rocket itself, during the November 20, 2024 launch. The launch pad's tower lost contact with the mission control center shortly after the Starship spacecraft separated from the Super Heavy first stage, as Musk wrote on X. As a result, the command was given to steer the first stage towards the Gulf of Mexico for a controlled splashdown. It's possible that the stage could have been caught by the tower in autonomous mode, but SpaceX decided not to take the risk. The recovery of the first stage of Super Heavy has already been successful, during the fifth test flight. However, the attempt was almost a failure, but it was successful in the end. The incident led to a software update for the first stage's equipment, which was intended to be tested during the sixth test flight. However, the ground infrastructure failed this time. The sixth test flight was still successful in its mission, providing valuable data on the dynamics of the Starship spacecraft's descent at subsonic speeds during the final stage of the flight before splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This data will help later to organize the capture of the Starship spacecraft by the launch pad's tower. However, at least one more test flight, the seventh, will take place before that. In this flight, the spacecraft will be larger and have a slightly different layout of the flaps. If the new version of the spacecraft shows a successful splashdown on the same side of the Earth as all previous flights, SpaceX may attempt to recover the Starship spacecraft and catch it in the air during the eighth flight, which is expected to take place in early 2025.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 21, 2024 06:22 PM\nSource:[3DNews - Daily Digital Digest](https://3dnews.ru/1114392/povodom-dlya-zatopleniya-raketi-super-heavy-vo-vremya-poslednego-zapuska-starship-stal-razriv-kanala-svyazi-s-kompyuterom-bashni-obslugivaniya)\n\n**Starship's Sixth Flight Test: A Step Towards Reusability**\nSpaceX's sixth Starship flight test was successfully completed on November 20, 2024.

However, unlike last month, telemetry data sent by the first stage led the company to decide not to bring the Super Heavy to the mechazilla, a structure developed to catch the propellant in the air. Instead, the rocket descended, as planned in case of contingency, in a controlled manner into the ocean. The second stage continued its suborbital trajectory, passing about an hour in space and making more than half a turn around the Earth, in an effort to push the envelope and establish higher limits for its operations. The spacecraft activated one of its Raptor engines in space, a first for the program. The landing, which was successful, was recorded by cameras on board and in nearby buoys, producing beautiful live images transmitted by SpaceX on its X social network account. This was the last flight with the original Starship model, which has undergone hundreds of mission improvements mission by mission. From the seventh flight, the updates will be more notable, including redesigned front flaps, larger propellant tanks, the new generation of thermal protection tiles, and secondary thermal protection layers. The goal is to develop a fully reusable thermal protection system that will enable rapid recovery and preparation of the Starship for new flights. The program still needs to demonstrate several technologies before the rocket can be used for human transportation to the lunar surface, as the NASA wants for the Artemis 3 mission, scheduled for the end of 2026 (with possible delay to 2027 or 2028).\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 07:09 PM\nSource:[uol.com.br](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ciencia/2024/11/em-novo-teste-spacex-desiste-de-capturar-starship-com-braco-robotico.shtml)\n\n**ispace and SpaceX Postpone Lunar Module Launch to January 2025**\nispace, a global company focused on lunar research, has released its financial results for the second quarter, which ended on March 31, 2024. The company, in collaboration with SpaceX, has announced that the launch of Mission 2 is now scheduled for no earlier than January 2025. The lunar landing module RESILIENCE is being prepared according to schedule and will be sent to Florida for final preparations before launch. The company's financial reports show a significant increase in sales of Mission 3 payload compared to previous results. Jumpei Nodzaki, ispace's financial and executive director, stated, 'We are proud to present our financial achievements, demonstrating significant progress in Mission 3 payload sales. Furthermore, we have signed memoranda of understanding and time service agreements (iPSA) with space agencies, government agencies, and companies worldwide worth $99 million. Now, we are moving to the stage of converting customer interest into effective contracts.' Nodzaki added, 'As Mission 2 approaches this winter, our goal is to expand interest in the space industry. In addition to new partners, all our employees, who share common goals, will work on creating a lunar economy.' ispace continues to lead the space industry by initiating partnerships and contracts with leading industry participants. The company is diligently working on creating a sustainable lunar economy, offering cargo delivery services to the Moon and promoting scientific and commercial projects on its surface.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has granted SpaceX simultaneous permits for the fifth and sixth test flights, possibly in response to recent regulatory disputes between the agency and the space company. The sixth mission will include a soft landing of the first stage of the heavy-lift rocket using SpaceX's Starship servicing tower. A new feature of this flight will be the attempt to restart one of the Starship's engines in a vacuum and adjust the angle of descent for testing the heat shields. These adjustments will allow for the evaluation and refinement of Starship's entry into the atmosphere scenarios. The spacecraft will also feature a modernized heat shield and reserve systems, while the heavy-lift rocket has received an updated software patch to address a programming glitch that nearly led to a failure during the previous test. If the rocket's landing is successful, SpaceX will move on to the seventh launch with an even more advanced Starship configuration, including an improved heat shield, larger fuel tanks, and redesigned aerodynamic flaps. The November test will play a crucial role in completing the Starship design, paving the way for a fully modernized system.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 03:34 PM\nSource:[24tv.ua](https://24tv.ua/tech/starship-gotuyetsya-do-shostogo-polotu-koli-vin-vidbudetsya_n2680613)\n\n**Space Force’s effort to bring in new launch providers hasn’t worked yet.

Alaska holds the record for the nation's coldest temperature, with a bone-chilling -80°F measured in Prospect Creek on January 23, 1971. In the continental U.S., the coldest temperature was recorded in Rogers Pass, Montana, on January 20, 1954, at -70°F. Other states with extreme low temperatures include North Dakota (-60°F in 1936), Minnesota (-60°F in 1996), and Wyoming (-66°F in 1933). Even states known for milder climates, such as Florida and Texas, have experienced surprising cold, with temperatures as low as -2°F and -23°F, respectively. Many of these record-setting lows were influenced by polar air masses or arctic outbreaks, which often bring high-pressure systems, clear skies, and snow-covered ground that trap cold air near the surface.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 29, 2024 08:17 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/coldest-temperature-ever-recorded-each-state-map-1993532)\n\n**DC sees warmest November in history ahead of frigid December**\nWashington D.C. is experiencing its warmest November on record, but a drastic change is expected as the polar vortex stretches over the eastern United States, bringing strong cold air from the Arctic Circle.

This is due to the 'lake effect', a meteorological phenomenon that occurs when cold air passes over large bodies of warmer water, such as the Great Lakes. Cities like Marquette, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, often record high levels of snow accumulation each winter, with averages of over 300 inches (7.6 meters). The 'lake effect' causes the warm and humid air over the water to rise rapidly, cool and condense, forming clouds that produce intense snowfall as they move towards land. According to a report by the University of Michigan, this phenomenon can produce very localized but intense snowfall, more common in autumn and winter when lake temperatures have not dropped drastically. Areas affected by the 'lake effect' can receive snow accumulations of several feet in a few days, making cities near the Great Lakes some of the snowiest in the US, after Alaska. However, a recent study by Wisevoter found that New Hampshire had the highest average annual snowfall, followed by Maine and Vermont, which surpassed Alaska in 2023. The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that the 2023-2024 winter was 'much warmer than normal', with December and February being warmer than average, and January being colder. Snowfall was also below normal, with most areas receiving 0.5 to 3 inches, except for a corridor in southern Illinois, which received 4 to 7 inches due to a strong storm on February 16, 2024.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 23, 2024 03:35 AM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/cual-es-el-estado-norteamericano-en-el-que-cae-mas-nieve-en-invierno-despues-de-alaska-segun-chatgpt-nid23112024/)\n\n**NOAA releases new outlook for winter 2024-25.

According to the Climate Prediction Center, La Niña is expected to develop and last through winter, which could lead to a wetter winter with more numerous storm systems moving across the Great Lakes region. However, temperatures are more difficult to predict, with an equal chance of being above or below average. Historically, La Niña winters have been mixed, with five colder-than-normal, six warmer-than-normal, and three near-normal winters in Chicago since 1996. The average snowfall is 38.4 inches, but Chicago only had around 20 inches in the past two years, making it likely that this winter will be wetter than average but not as mild as the past few winters. As noted by the National Weather Service, 'it's likely not going to be as mild as the past few winters have been in Chicago.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 22, 2024 05:40 PM\nSource:[nbcchicago.com](https://www.nbcchicago.com/weather/noaa-releases-new-outlook-for-winter-2024-25-what-it-means-for-chicago-area/3607786/)\n\n**Chicago Thanksgiving weather: chilly and possibly wet**\nChicagoans can expect a chilly Thanksgiving holiday weekend with a chance of rain or snow overnight on Wednesday.

National Weather Service meteorologist Ricky Castro said, 'It's a little too early to say' whether there will be precipitation, but there is 'pretty high confidence' that it will be a colder pattern. The week of Thanksgiving will bring a 'return to colder conditions' after milder weather in the low 50s on Sunday. A cold front is expected to come through the Chicago area on Monday, bringing a chilly air mass into the region. After the holiday weekend, Castro said that a 'pretty cold start to December' appears likely, with even colder air coming into the region. This could bring 'occasional chances for accumulating snow,' with Thursday's snowfall being the season's first 'wake-up call that we're in Northern Illinois.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 22, 2024 04:51 PM\nSource:[Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/11/22/chicago-thanksgiving-weather-forecast-in-chicago/)\n\n**Winter 2024: Countries to be Covered by Snow and Reach Freezing Temperatures**\nThe National Center for Atmospheric Prediction (CPC) expects a 60% chance of a phenomenon called 'nina' to occur in the United States from December 2024 to February 2025, which can cause significant temperature fluctuations and precipitation in the upper Mississippi River Valley. The CPC also predicts that the phenomenon of 'nina' will continue until March 2025, making it more likely for the world to experience colder temperatures than usual. The CPC notes that the shift from the 'nino' phenomenon to the 'nina' phenomenon will bring changes to the global climate, with some regions experiencing more variability than others. In the United States, 17 states have been issued winter weather warnings, with parts of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, and South Dakota expected to experience cold temperatures. Heavy snowfall is expected in the Oregon Cascades, with up to 2 feet of snow, and 15-18 inches of snow in the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming and the Colorado Mountains.

Typically, the city sees its first snowfall before November, but this year's warm temperatures have pushed back the event. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the city has not yet experienced its first measurable snowfall this year, and the warm weather may continue to delay the event. The NWS predicts a 70-80% chance of above-average temperatures in Illinois, including Chicago, from November 14-22, which reduces the likelihood of snow in the next few weeks. The last time Chicago took this long to register its first snowfall was in 1999, when the first snowfall occurred on December 5. The city's last significant snowfall was on December 28, 2021, three days after Christmas. The warm temperatures for November are also unusual, with highs expected to reach 16°C (61°F) in some areas, which is uncommon for this time of year. While this warm trend may reduce the chances of snow, it does not rule it out. An increase in precipitation is projected for late November, which could bring a rapid drop in temperatures and the first snowfall. However, the type of precipitation will depend on how temperatures fluctuate in the coming weeks.

The company predicts that the Chicago area could see significant snowfall, exceeding the amounts recorded in the past season. However, this winter may also bring warmer temperatures than usual, with lower heating demands in the northern part of the state. The snowfall accumulations, ranging from 76 to 114 cm, would surpass the 56.3 cm that fell in the 2023-2024 winter. Paul Pastelok, AccuWeather meteorologist, noted that the La Niña phenomenon, although present, will be weak, allowing other factors to influence the climate pattern, resulting in more variability during the winter. A polar vortex could bring cold air in February, but it's uncertain if it will reach the continental United States. The forecast also indicates that several cities in the northeastern and midwestern United States, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, will see more snow than last winter, potentially reaching near-historical averages. Additionally, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan may experience a significant increase in snowfall. The climate variability in the 2024-2025 season is expected to bring periods of snow and intense cold, but also warmer air from the Pacific in early 2025, which could reduce snowfall and alter the climate in some areas. Pastelok warned about the risk of severe storms during the winter, which could affect states further north, such as Missouri, Arkansas, and Tennessee, while the risk of severe storms would increase along the Gulf of Mexico coast in February.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 27, 2024 11:39 AM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/illinois/cuanta-nieve-puede-esperarse-en-illinois-este-invierno-nid27102024/)\n\n**A La Niña winter is expected, scientists say; here's what it means for snow and temps in Chicago**\nScientists predict a La Niña winter for the United States, which may bring a colder and wetter winter to Chicago and the rest of Illinois. According to the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center, there's a 60% chance of La Niña emerging between September to November, with the expectation that it will continue through March. Trent Ford, the Illinois state climatologist, cautioned that 'there's a lot of variability between La Niña years,' and that other weather patterns can affect the outcome. La Niña can cause a 'more northerly storm track' in the winter months, leading to colder and wetter conditions in the northern part of the continental U.S. Ford said that Chicago may be wetter than normal from December through February, with a strong chance of cold outbreaks and possibly more chances for heavier snow. However, he noted that there's a big caveat to these predictions, as lots of other events can affect the weather, including sea ice in the Arctic and Eurasian snow cover. 'Unfortunately, after a brief period in the spring of 2024 with minimal drought conditions across the country, more than a quarter of the land mass in the continental U.S. is currently in at least a moderate drought,' said Brad Pugh, operational drought lead with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center. 'And the winter precipitation outlook does not bode well for widespread relief.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 06:38 PM\nSource:[Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/10/24/a-la-nina-winter-is-expected-scientists-say-heres-what-it-means-for-snow-and-temps-in-chicago/)\n\n**How cold, snowy could Chicago's winter be? Latest winter weather predictions**\nAccording to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) latest winter weather outlook for 2024-25, a 'La Niña' winter is expected, which would result in a 'wetter than normal' winter in the Great Lakes, especially in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. Kevin Jeanes, a meteorologist, said that this would be beneficial as the region has been experiencing a moderate drought. The winter precipitation outlook for the Chicago area is expected to be above average, with 18.5 inches of snow recorded during the 2023-24 meteorological winter, 11.1 inches below normal. However, the big question is whether temperatures will cause precipitation to fall in the form of rain or snow. Jeanes noted that it could be colder than last year, but only compared to the extremely warm temperatures recorded in 2023-24. NOAA predicts 'equal chances' of temperatures being above or below average. A much colder winter is expected across the Northwest, while a La Niña event typically leads to cooler springs if the pattern persists. According to the Climate Prediction Center, La Niña is favored to emerge between September and November and is expected to persist through the winter months.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 11:47 AM\nSource:[nbcchicago.com](https://www.nbcchicago.com/weather/how-cold-snowy-could-chicagos-winter-be-heres-what-the-latest-weather-predictions-say-for-2024-25/3583029/)\n\n**Chicago Prepares for First Snows of Winter**\nTemperatures in Illinois, USA, are dropping, and frost warnings are being issued in Chicago. While immediate forecasts do not predict snow, the city is preparing for the first signs of winter. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the first light snows typically occur by the end of October, marking the beginning of winter. Estimated snowfall dates are as follows: light snows (less than 2.54 cm) are expected on average by October 31, significant snowfall (2.54 cm or more) is expected to occur from November 18, and snowfall of one inch or more is expected on December 7. However, it is possible that snow could occur earlier. This winter may be influenced by La Niña, a weather pattern that could lead to a 'wetter-than-normal' winter, especially in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the La Niña event is expected to strengthen during the winter months. This forecast also predicts that more storm systems will hit the Chicago area, with a 50/50 chance of precipitation being rain or snow. However, the University of Illinois notes that stronger La Niña patterns can produce winters that are 'warmer and wetter than average', with more snow and winter storms during those seasons.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 02:59 PM\nSource:[2001online.com](https://2001online.com/usa/servicios/illinois-sepa-para-cuando-se-estima-que-empezara-a-nevar-en-chicago-2024102310240)\n\n**How will winter be in Illinois: the amount of snow that will fall in the prairie state**\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its winter climate forecast for 2024-25. The winter season in Illinois is expected to be influenced by the 'La Niña' climate phenomenon, which is characterized by the cooling of Pacific Ocean waters. This may lead to some unexpected weather patterns in the state. The NOAA indicates that the 'La Niña' pattern is expected to strengthen during the winter season, which runs from December 1 to February 28, and may direct the prevailing jet stream more to the north, leading to more storm systems hitting the Chicago area. According to AccuWeather, Chicago is expected to receive between 76 and 114 cm of snow this winter, which is significantly more than the 56.4 cm received in 2023 and even exceeds the average of the past decade, which was 97.5 cm. AccuWeather's meteorologist, Paul Pastelok, notes that a less intense 'La Niña' allows other climate variables to take center stage, which could result in a more variable winter. In Chicago, this could mean warmer-than-usual temperatures and less heating demand in the northern half of the state. Although there is a possibility of a polar vortex in February, the certainty of its arrival is low. This could influence the appearance of intense cold air in the United States. The University of Illinois notes that stronger 'La Niña' patterns tend to produce winters that are 'warmer and wetter than average,' with more snow and winter storms during those seasons.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 21, 2024 05:58 AM\nSource:[El Comercio Perú](https://elcomercio.pe/mag/respuestas/us/como-sera-el-invierno-en-illinois-la-cantidad-de-nieve-que-caera-en-el-estado-de-la-pradera-estados-unidos-nnda-nnlt-noticia/)\n\n**Saudi Arabia to Experience Winter Seasonally in December**\nAccording to meteorologist Akil Al-Akail, the winter season will officially begin on December 1, while the astronomical winter will start on December 22.

Winter (December - February) is perfect for snow sports and witnessing the Northern Lights, while spring (March - May) is ideal for exploring Alaska's wild beauty without crowds. Summer (June - August) is the peak tourism season, with long days and mild temperatures, ideal for outdoor adventures like hiking, fishing, and kayaking. Fall (September - November) is a quieter time, but still stunning, with autumn colors and excellent wildlife viewing opportunities. Alaska's diverse landscapes and activities make it a top destination at any time of the year, with festivals and events like the Anchorage Fur Rendezvous and the Sitka Whalefest.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2024 12:30 AM\nSource:[worldatlas.com](https://www.worldatlas.com/travel/when-is-the-best-time-to-visit-alaska.html)\n\n**NOAA Releases Winter Weather Forecast for Chicago Area**\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its winter weather forecast for the Chicago area, and residents may need to prepare for what's to come. According to NOAA officials, a 'slow-developing' La Niña event in the Pacific Ocean will likely strengthen the dominant weather pattern in the Great Lakes, resulting in a 'wetter-than-normal' winter, especially in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. The La Niña pattern is expected to intensify during the meteorological winter, which runs from December 1 to February 28, and will likely direct the prevailing jet stream more to the north, causing more storm systems to hit the Chicago area. The question remains whether temperatures will cause precipitation to fall as rain or snow. At this point, NOAA says there is 'equal probability' of temperatures above or below average, which could have a significant impact on whether it rains or snows in the region. According to NOAA, they have implemented several improvements to their forecasting tools, including an experimental model called the 'Winter Storm Severity Probability Index'. These data were used to help with this year's projections after it was first implemented at the end of 2023, according to officials. According to the University of Illinois, the strongest La Niña patterns can produce winters that are 'warmer and wetter than average', with more snow and winter storms during those seasons. A La Niña event also tends to cause colder springs if the pattern persists. In a La Niña event, the trade winds are stronger than usual and push warm water away from the Americas and towards Asia, allowing a process known as 'upwelling' to occur, which brings cold water to the ocean's surface. These cold waters cause polar jet streams to form more to the north, leading to droughts in the southern United States and more precipitation in the Midwest and the northwest Pacific.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 17, 2024 06:13 PM\nSource:[telemundochicago.com](https://www.telemundochicago.com/noticias/local/noaa-publica-sus-proyecciones-del-tiempo-inviernal-para-el-area-de-chicago/2499000/)\n\n**Temperatures falling — will the snow follow?**\nTemperatures in Anchorage, Alaska are falling, but it's unclear if snow will follow. The average first date of measurable snow is October 16, but this year it might come earlier. A strong storm is brewing, set to hit over the weekend, bringing cooler temperatures and heavy rainfall. Snow levels are expected to drop to around 500 feet in Anchorage on Wednesday night, with hillside locations potentially seeing sticking or accumulating snow. According to the National Weather Service, snow would have to measure 0.10 of an inch to be considered 'measurable' and recorded. So far, October has been a dry month, with only 0.03 inches of precipitation. The hot spot in Alaska on Tuesday was Cordova at 59 degrees, while the cold spot was Kuparuk at 16 degrees.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2024 01:57 AM\nSource:[alaskasnewssource.com](https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2024/10/09/temperatures-falling-will-snow-follow/)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."
