**Trump and Harris in a tight race in the 7 battleground states: NYT/Siena poll By Investing.com**
The presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald J. Trump is extremely close, with the New York Times and Siena College poll indicating that Harris is gaining momentum in North Carolina and Georgia, while Trump is narrowing her lead in Pennsylvania and maintaining an advantage in Arizona. Harris holds slight leads in Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, while Trump leads in Arizona. The margins in these seven states are within the polls' sampling error, making it difficult to determine a definitive lead. Recent undecided voters may be leaning towards Harris, with a 55-44 lead among those who decided on their vote within the last few weeks. However, Trump shows strength among voters who intend to vote but have not yet done so.

**US Presidential Election: Pennsylvania Key to Harris or Trump's Victory**
The 2024 US presidential election is expected to be one of the closest and most contentious in American history. According to a New York Times public opinion tracker, as of Sunday, all seven swing states were roughly tied. Trump had a 3-point lead in Arizona, while the other six states were within one point of each other. The election is expected to be decided by a small margin, with 43,000 votes making the difference in 2020. Pennsylvania, with 19 electoral votes, is the most crucial state in the seven swing states. If Harris loses Pennsylvania, she would need to win North Carolina or Georgia, which have voted for Democratic candidates only three times in the past four decades. On the other hand, if Trump loses Pennsylvania, he would need to win Wisconsin or Michigan, which have voted for Republican candidates only once in the past four decades. Both Harris and Trump have focused heavily on Pennsylvania, with the two campaigns and their allies spending $279.3 million on advertising in the state, more than in any other state. The outcome of the election will depend on the results in these seven swing states, with the winner needing to secure 270 electoral votes out of 538 to win the presidency.

**Here's the key to reading the tight polls and predicting a Trump win**
The author of a New York Post piece predicting Donald Trump's win in the 2024 presidential election explains how they derived their numbers. They argue that the key to reading tight polls is understanding the balance between Democrats and Republicans among voters, or partisan preference. The author notes that pollsters use weighting methods to adjust for demographic differences, but these methods can be flawed. They use data from two recent national polls to show how different weighting methods can produce different results. The author then averages the findings of each poll to estimate the partisan breakdown, which shows Harris leading with Democrats by 89 points and Trump leading with Republicans by 87 points. They use this estimate to compute the national popular vote totals under different partisan scenarios, concluding that Trump would win the popular vote by a 0.46-point margin in an R+2 electorate. The author predicts the popular vote percentages, with Harris winning by 1.3 points, and uses this to call the Electoral College. They argue that Trump would carry every swing state, giving him 312 electoral votes to Harris' 229. However, they mention three reasons why Harris could still win: a D-friendly electorate, Harris doing better with independents, or a dramatic reduction in the Electoral College gap. They reject each of these possibilities, citing data on voter registration and poll analysis. The author concludes that the cumulative weight of the evidence suggests Trump has the better chance of prevailing.

**Harris and Trump locked in tight race in swing states, NYT/Siena poll shows**
According to the final New York Times/Siena College poll, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump are in a tight race in the country's seven battleground states, with Harris leading in Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, and Trump leading in Arizona. The two are in close races in Michigan, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, with the matchups within the poll's 3.5% margin of error. Harris led among voters who had already cast their ballots by 8 percentage points, while Trump leads among voters who say they are very likely to vote but have not yet done so. The tied race in Pennsylvania shows Trump gaining momentum in a state Harris had previously led by four percentage points.

**Confidence and Panic: The State of Mind of Trump Supporters and Democrats**
Vivek Ramaswamy, a supporter of Donald Trump, has stated that New York is a 'pivot state', despite the fact that Kamala Harris is leading in the polls with 54.6% of the intentions of vote compared to 39.4% for Donald Trump. This confidence is reflected in the state of mind of many Trump supporters, who are predicting a landslide victory for the former president. Meanwhile, Democrats are nervous and anxious, with many of their strategists, candidates, and celebrities expressing their doubts and fears about the presidential campaign of Kamala Harris. According to a recent article by Axios, many Democrats are privately expressing their concerns that Harris may lose, despite the polls indicating a close race. 'Why are Democrats nervous? Because they are Democrats,' wrote Josh Marshall, editor-in-chief of Talking Points Memo, in 2020. 'Independently of objective realities, Democrats will always anticipate a defeat or worry about it, while Republicans will always be confident in their victory.' The 2022 midterm elections illustrated this phenomenon, with Republicans predicting a red wave that would give them a majority in both the House and Senate, while Democrats were worried about their chances. However, the final result showed that Democrats increased their majority in the Senate and limited their losses in the House. 'It's not a rule, but it's almost a law of American politics,' Marshall wrote. 'Donald Trump may win the election, but the current polls do not justify the triumphalism of some Republicans, nor do they justify the panic of some Democrats.'

**Trump vs. Harris: Who's Leading in New York?**
With just days to go before the US presidential elections on November 5, 2024, candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are intensifying their campaigns to win over voters and secure the White House for the 2024-2028 term. In New York, early voting has begun, and many residents have cast their ballots, showing strong support for presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who is leading by a significant margin in the state's polls. According to a Fivethirtyeight.com poll from October 29, Harris is leading Trump by +15.2 points, with 54.6% of voters intending to vote for her compared to 39.4% for Trump. This reflects strong support from New York citizens and some Latinos living in the state for the Democratic candidate and current Vice President Kamala Harris. If she wins, she will take all 28 of New York's electoral votes.

**How Donald J. Trump Can Win New York State**
Donald Trump's recent rally at Madison Square Garden was a huge success, with 20,000 seats sold out in 3 hours and tens of thousands watching on big screens outside. Experts may be writing off Trump's chances of winning New York State, but his campaign strategy, which includes visiting minority neighborhoods and speaking with locals, has shown promise. Trump's polling numbers in NYC have recently increased to 27%, and factoring in his history of under polling, he may be at 30% or higher. To win, Trump only needs to flip a little over half of those who voted for someone other than Lee Zeldin in the 2022 election, who were disaffected and angry over Democratic policies. As Trump has overcome odds steeper than this before, it's not impossible for him to win. 'Experts' writing off any chance of the former president winning the Empire State could be overlooking the 2022 run Lee Zeldin made against Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul, where Zeldin got 30% of the vote and lost by less than 6 points, after repeatedly saying that if he won 35% of the vote in NYC, he'd be NY's chief executive.

**Is Harris losing ground to Trump? What NYT/Siena poll says about popular vote**
The final poll before the 2024 US presidential election from The New York Times and Siena College shows Vice President Kamala Harris losing her 3 percentage point lead against former President Donald Trump. The latest polls found Harris deadlocked with Trump at 48% each, sparking predictions of Harris losing the popular vote to Trump. This would be the first time the Democratic ticket loses the popular vote since the last four elections. The poll also found that only 28% of respondents believe the US is heading in the right direction, which is negative for Harris' standing. The poll was conducted on October 20-23 with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Neck and Neck in Polls**
With just a few days left before the US presidential election on November 5, the contest between Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump remains intense. According to polls, the election is expected to be polarized, with both candidates neck and neck in the popular vote and key states. As reported by 'The New York Times' and 'FiveThirtyEight', the current projections indicate that Donald Trump has a slight advantage over Kamala Harris and would win the election. However, the outcome is still uncertain, and the election will likely be decided by individual votes. 'The New York Times' and 'FiveThirtyEight' use different methodologies, which may result in varying numbers. To win the election, a candidate needs to secure 270 out of 538 electoral votes. The candidate who wins the most votes in a state gets all of that state's electoral votes, regardless of the margin of victory. Currently, the polls indicate that Kamala Harris has a numerical advantage, but Donald Trump is leading in the national average. According to 'The New York Times', Kamala Harris has 49% of the vote, while Donald Trump has 48%. 'FiveThirtyEight' reports that Kamala Harris has 48.2% of the vote, while Donald Trump has 46.4%.

**Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in a Tight Race Ahead of 2024 US Presidential Election**
With less than three weeks to go before the 2024 US presidential election, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are neck and neck. According to recent polls by FiveThirtyEight, Harris leads Trump by 2.5 points, with 48.5% of the vote compared to 46.1% for the former president. However, Trump is gaining ground, and undecided voters may still play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the election. A map by 270towin shows that Trump is gaining support in states like Texas, Florida, and Minnesota, while Harris is losing ground in states like California, Illinois, and New York, although she is making gains in Oregon and Colorado.

**US Presidential Election: Who Will Win, Polls, and Voting Date**
With three weeks to go before the US presidential election, polls show Democratic candidate Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump by three to five percentage points. However, The New York Times notes that 'simple math proves the inevitable defeat of the Republican candidate.' But, as we know, Trump won in 2016, defying expectations. The paper suggests that the polls may have been flawed, with social scientists focusing on the wrong statistics or being influenced by their clients. The current polls show a three-percentage-point lead for Harris, but other surveys give Trump a 1.2% lead. The outcome of the election will depend on the number of electoral votes each candidate receives, with 583 votes in total. In most states, the winner takes all, so a candidate can win by a large margin but still lose the election. The current polls show Trump leading in six of the seven 'swing' states, but the margin is very small. The situation in these states will be crucial in determining the outcome of the election. Meanwhile, financial markets are predicting a Trump victory, with a 56% chance of him winning, according to the Polymarket website. 'This is a game of margins,' says Harris's advisor, David Plouffe. 'Any poll showing a 4-5 point lead for Harris or Trump in one of these seven states, ignore it.' The US presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024.

**Kamala Harris Leads Donald Trump in New York Polls**
As the US presidential election approaches on November 5, 2024, recent polls in New York have shown a significant lead for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris over Republican candidate Donald Trump. According to a poll by FiveThirtyEight, Harris has maintained a lead of over 14 percentage points since October 1, with 53.8% of the vote. The Hill's data collection, which began in August, shows a narrowing gap between the candidates, but Harris still leads by 16%. New York is considered a 'blue' state, where Democrats have historically received strong support. The state's 28 electoral votes are crucial in the election, as a candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win. Harris has been leading in several recent polls in New York, including a survey by ActiVote, which found that she leads Trump by 21.2% with 60.6% of the vote, while Trump has 39.4%. Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, noted that the economy is the top issue for 37% of New York voters, followed by affordability of housing, immigration, threats to democracy, and crime.

**Trump gains momentum for electoral victory in 2024**
Former President Donald Trump is gaining momentum in the 2024 US presidential election, with recent polling data suggesting he is on the verge of an electoral landslide. Trump is polling well in battleground states and even in historically Democratic strongholds like New York, where he is 13 points behind Vice President Kamala Harris, a 10-point improvement from the previous two elections. This shift in voter sentiment raises the possibility of Trump flipping multiple battleground states in his favor, setting up a potential return to the White House. While it is unlikely that Trump will win New York in 2024, the significant improvement in polling suggests a broader trend of rising support for the former president.

**Kamala Harris Leads Donald Trump in New York Polls**
According to recent polls, Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump in the state of New York, with a margin of 14 points, 55.7% to 41.9%, respectively. This is consistent with the results of the 2020 election, where Joe Biden won by 23 points. A recent Emerson College poll found that 54% of respondents would vote for Harris, while 40% would vote for Trump. Another poll by Siena College found similar results, with 55% of respondents supporting Harris and 42% supporting Trump. However, some polls, such as ActiVote, show a wider margin between the two candidates, with Harris leading by 17 points, 58% to 42%. Harris is leading among most demographic groups, including urban voters and those with higher levels of education. Trump is only leading among rural voters and those with lower levels of education, and among Republican voters, where he retains over 90% of their votes. The winner of the election in New York will receive all 29 electoral votes from the state.

**Polls suggest a 270-268 election result as Harris gains slight lead over Trump: Report**
A New York Times report suggests that the 2024 presidential election could result in a 270-268 outcome, with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris having a slight lead over former president Donald Trump. According to the report, Harris secured a one percentage point lead in Michigan, two in Wisconsin, and nine in Nebraska's Second Congressional District, while Trump led in Ohio by six points. The report notes that such a result would only be possible if the Times/Siena polls in every state prove to be accurate. Andrew Wroe, a professor in American politics at the University of Kent, stated, 'What they see is that swing-state polls show that race is much tighter than the national polls indicate.'

**US 2024: Latest NYT Poll Shows Close Race Between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump**
With the US presidential election approaching, the latest New York Times poll shows a close race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Harris initially seemed to be in the lead, but Trump has been gaining ground in recent weeks. The key battleground states will be Michigan and Wisconsin, where the polls show a tight race. In Michigan, Harris has 48% support among likely voters, while Trump has 47%, which is within the margin of error. In Wisconsin, Harris has 49% support, while Trump has 47%. However, Harris has a 9-point lead in Nebraska's Second Congressional District, which could be decisive in the Electoral College. If Harris wins Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, and Trump wins the Sun Belt states, Harris could win the election with the 270 electoral votes needed. As Harris said, 'the economy is the most important issue that sways voters', and Trump's persistence on economic issues has narrowed Harris's lead.

**Could We See a 270-268 Election? The Polls Are Tighter Than Ever.**
According to recent New York Times/Siena College polls, the 2024 presidential election is extremely close. If the polls were accurate, Kamala Harris would win the Electoral College with 270 votes, while Donald J. Trump would have 268. The average of six polls in core battleground states shows Trump leading by just 0.6 of a point. This is the closest modern U.S. presidential election in terms of electoral count. As Hillary Clinton noted, a modest lead is not a guarantee of victory, and neither Harris nor Trump can claim a clear lead in this election.

**Donald Trump Surges in Top Election Forecast**
According to the latest forecast from 538, Donald Trump's chances of beating Kamala Harris in the 2024 election have improved, although Harris is still considered the slight favorite overall. Harris has a 55-in-100 chance of winning the majority of the Electoral College votes, with Trump given a 45-in-100 chance. This is an improvement from the 39 percent chance Trump was given on September 17, while Harris has dropped from a 61 percent chance of victory. G. Elliott Morris from 538 said, 'Harris' current lead in the race is 'barely better than a coin flip.' Slim margins in the swing states make this cycle's presidential race the closest in decades, with the outcome potentially being closer than in any election in nearly 150 years.' The New York Times/Siena poll shows Trump leading in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, while Harris can afford to lose these states if she wins the three 'blue wall' swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The Quinnipiac University poll shows Trump with a 1 point lead over Harris in a full ballot, and the pair are tied on 48 percent in a two-way race. The poll also shows a decline in enthusiasm among Harris supporters, with 70 percent saying they are 'very enthusiastic' about voting for her, compared to 71 percent of Trump supporters.

According to a New York Times/Siena College poll, Donald Trump has surged ahead in Arizona, maintaining a four-point lead in Georgia and holding steady in North Carolina.

In North Carolina, Trump is up two points (49-47 percent), while in Georgia, he maintains a four-point lead (49-45 percent). The polls sampled 713 registered voters in Arizona, 682 in Georgia, and 682 in North Carolina, with a margin of error of 4.4-4.6 percentage points. Analysts say that North Carolina and Georgia are essential to Trump's hopes of returning to the White House, and that Harris could win even while losing all three states, though it would be difficult.

**Clear Winner? Donald Trump Narrows Gap with Kamala Harris in New York, Poll Shows Democratic Stronghold Weakening**
A recent Siena College poll shows a surprising shift in voter sentiment in New York, with former President Donald Trump trailing Vice President Kamala Harris by only 12 points. This marks a significant departure from the 2020 election, when Joe Biden carried the state by a 23% margin. According to the poll, Harris could be poised to deliver the weakest Democratic performance in New York since 1988. As Democrats face mounting pressure to reinforce their positions in key states, Harris's ability to maintain strong support in New York could prove critical in the 2024 election. As one observer notes, 'New York has long been a Democratic stronghold, but the narrowing margin underscores challenges for Harris in solidifying the base.'

**Trump stumps on Long Island, vowing to ‘win New York' after losing big twice**
Donald Trump held a rally in Uniondale, New York, vowing to 'win New York' in the 2024 presidential election. Despite losing the state by more than 20 points in 2016 and 2020, Trump insisted that he can win, saying 'I can win New York, and we can win New York.' Election analysts do not regard New York as a competitive state, but Trump's campaign is trying to shore up GOP voters who are skeptical of him. Trump thanked vulnerable Republican representatives and cited surveys showing rank-and-file support in the Teamsters union, which he claimed sided with him. He also repeated his claims of a 'third-world nation' and 'invasion' at the US-Mexico border, and defended his 2016 pitch to Black voters, which was widely viewed as offensive. Trump also used the rally to recount Sunday's apparent assassination attempt and blamed Democrats for using language that he claims is a threat to democracy.

**Trump prepares to prove his New York prediction wrong for the third time**
Donald Trump has repeatedly predicted that he will win New York's electoral votes in his presidential bids, despite losing the state by more than 20 points in both 2016 and 2020. In an interview with the New York Post, Trump said, 'I'll solve the crime problem. I'll solve their tax problem. I'll solve all their problems. Who would not vote for me?' However, Trump went on to lose by more than 20 points again. A new poll by Siena College shows Trump trailing Vice President Kamala Harris by 13 points in the state, which is closer than the results of actual voting have been over the past two decades. Trump's optimism is likely rooted in the Republican Party's success in the state in 2022, but it's unlikely that he will win New York this time around, given the state's history of favoring Democratic candidates.

**Trump makes a bold prediction about the 2024 presidential election**
Former President Donald Trump predicted victory in the 2024 presidential election, specifically in the reliably blue state of New York, saying 'We are going to win New York. And that's the first time in many, many years that a Republican can honestly say it.' Trump made a similar pledge four years ago, but lost the state to President Biden by over 23 points. Polling suggests Trump has no serious chance of carrying New York in his 2024 election showdown with Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump promised New Yorkers that if he wins back the White House, 'I'm going to reduce your taxes, reduce your crime, and reduce your levels of stress.' The rally was seen as an opportunity to make efficient use of Trump's time, as his campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said, 'when [Trump] delivers a message there, it's piped directly into homes in every market in every battleground state.' While Trump is unlikely to carry New York, the rally may help Republicans down-ballot, as they try to hold on to their House of Representatives majority in November's elections.

Trump also used the rally to defend his past comments on immigration and crime, and to attack his opponents, including Vice President Kamala Harris. He repeated misrepresentations about Harris's record and blamed Democrats for a recent assassination attempt on him. Trump also fundraised during his visit and held meetings with donors. 'New York is sending Donald Trump back with a Republican Congress to work with,' former Rep. Lee Zeldin said in one of the warm-up speeches before Trump.

**Trump: I'll Do What GOP Has Not Done Since '84, Win N.Y.**
Former President Donald Trump said he will campaign in New York, a state no Republican presidential candidate has carried since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Trump told a rally in Uniondale, New York, 'I said, I can win New York, and we can win New York.' He claimed that with his vote, they will 'rescue our country, rescue our Democrat-run states, and start by saving the great state of New York.' Trump lost New York by nearly 23 percentage points in both 2016 and 2020, but Republicans have been buoyed by flipping four New York House seats in the 2022 midterms and the performance of former Rep. Lee Zeldin, who lost to Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul by 6.2 points in 2022. Trump said, 'Our cities were the center of business, arts, culture. Our streets, ports, waterways were the arteries of American commerce. But look at what has happened to New York and the other states all run by radical left Democrats.' He highlighted the issues in New York, including a 29% increase in robbery, a 36% increase in felony assault, a 42% increase in grand larceny, and a 75% increase in carjackings. Trump then used a slogan he used in 2016, saying, 'So, I say to the people of New York with crime at record levels, with terrorists and criminals pouring in, and with inflation eating your hearts out, vote for Donald Trump. What the hell do you have to lose?'

**Trump Declares He'll Win State He Lost by 23 Points Twice: 'We're Gonna Win New York!'**
Former President Donald Trump held a campaign rally in New York, stating that he will win the state in the upcoming general election. Trump lost New York by 23 points in 2016 and 2020, but said, 'We're going to win New York!' and 'I can win New York and we can win New York.' He pledged to reduce taxes, crime, and stress, while increasing incomes and love for the state. However, a poll conducted in August shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Trump by 16 points. This was Trump's second rally in New York in recent months.

**The Brutal Polling Is Starting to Irritate Liberals and It's Fantastic to Watch**
The 2024 presidential election is heating up, with Donald Trump leading in the polls. According to Nate Silver's projection, Trump has a 64% chance of winning 270 electoral votes. Recent polls, including a Pew national poll, show the race tied nationally, which would likely translate to a loss for Kamala Harris in the Electoral College. The New York Times and Pew polls also indicate that Trump is on track to win. CNN's Harry Enten noted that if Trump outperforms his polling by a single point, he would win. ABC News' Matthew Dowd attempted to downplay the polls, but Nate Silver dismissed his claims as a coping mechanism. The article concludes that Harris' record and agenda are liabilities, and that her lack of trustworthiness and grasp of issues are major concerns.

**Trump and Harris Tied in Final Weeks of 2024 Election, Poll Shows**
According to a national poll conducted by The New York Times and Siena College, presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are effectively tied in the final weeks of the 2024 election. Trump leads Harris by a single point, 48%-47%, with a margin of error of three points, making either candidate's victory possible on November 5th. The poll suggests that Trump's base of support remains strong, with 28% of likely voters saying they need more information about Harris, compared to only 9% saying the same about Trump. The debate on Tuesday could be a crucial moment, with Harris having the opportunity to provide more details on her policies while facing off against Trump for 90 minutes. The poll's findings are similar to those of the last comparable poll from the New York Times/Siena College, published in late July, where Trump also led by a single point. Polls in the seven key swing states that will likely determine the election winner have also shown a very close race.

**Trump takes narrow lead in NYT poll amid fears Kamala's 'honeymoon' is collapsing**
A New York Times/Siena College poll conducted September 3-6 shows Donald Trump leading Kamala Harris by 1 percent, 48 percent to 47 percent, within the 3-point margin of error. The poll suggests that despite Harris' 'honeymoon phase,' support for Trump's bid for a second, nonconsecutive White House term remains strong. In the seven swing states key to winning the 2024 election, Trump and Harris are neck-and-neck or within the margin of error. The two candidates will meet for their first debate on September 10 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, hosted by ABC News. With only eight weeks until Election Day on November 5, many MAGA supporters and Republicans claim that Harris' polling and enthusiasm bump are part of a honeymoon phase and will wear off before voters cast their ballots.

**Trump and Harris in a tight race in the 7 battleground states: NYT/Siena poll By Investing.com**
The presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald J. Trump is extremely close, with the New York Times and Siena College poll indicating that Harris is gaining momentum in North Carolina and Georgia, while Trump is narrowing her lead in Pennsylvania and maintaining an advantage in Arizona. Harris holds slight leads in Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, while Trump leads in Arizona. The margins in these seven states are within the polls' sampling error, making it difficult to determine a definitive lead. Recent undecided voters may be leaning towards Harris, with a 55-44 lead among those who decided on their vote within the last few weeks. However, Trump shows strength among voters who intend to vote but have not yet done so.

**US Presidential Election: Pennsylvania Key to Harris or Trump's Victory**
The 2024 US presidential election is expected to be one of the closest and most contentious in American history. According to a New York Times public opinion tracker, as of Sunday, all seven swing states were roughly tied. Trump had a 3-point lead in Arizona, while the other six states were within one point of each other. The election is expected to be decided by a small margin, with 43,000 votes making the difference in 2020. Pennsylvania, with 19 electoral votes, is the most crucial state in the seven swing states. If Harris loses Pennsylvania, she would need to win North Carolina or Georgia, which have voted for Democratic candidates only three times in the past four decades. On the other hand, if Trump loses Pennsylvania, he would need to win Wisconsin or Michigan, which have voted for Republican candidates only once in the past four decades. Both Harris and Trump have focused heavily on Pennsylvania, with the two campaigns and their allies spending $279.3 million on advertising in the state, more than in any other state. The outcome of the election will depend on the results in these seven swing states, with the winner needing to secure 270 electoral votes out of 538 to win the presidency.

**Here's the key to reading the tight polls and predicting a Trump win**
The author of a New York Post piece predicting Donald Trump's win in the 2024 presidential election explains how they derived their numbers. They argue that the key to reading tight polls is understanding the balance between Democrats and Republicans among voters, or partisan preference. The author notes that pollsters use weighting methods to adjust for demographic differences, but these methods can be flawed. They use data from two recent national polls to show how different weighting methods can produce different results. The author then averages the findings of each poll to estimate the partisan breakdown, which shows Harris leading with Democrats by 89 points and Trump leading with Republicans by 87 points. They use this estimate to compute the national popular vote totals under different partisan scenarios, concluding that Trump would win the popular vote by a 0.46-point margin in an R+2 electorate. The author predicts the popular vote percentages, with Harris winning by 1.3 points, and uses this to call the Electoral College. They argue that Trump would carry every swing state, giving him 312 electoral votes to Harris' 229. However, they mention three reasons why Harris could still win: a D-friendly electorate, Harris doing better with independents, or a dramatic reduction in the Electoral College gap. They reject each of these possibilities, citing data on voter registration and poll analysis. The author concludes that the cumulative weight of the evidence suggests Trump has the better chance of prevailing.

**Harris and Trump locked in tight race in swing states, NYT/Siena poll shows**
According to the final New York Times/Siena College poll, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump are in a tight race in the country's seven battleground states, with Harris leading in Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, and Trump leading in Arizona. The two are in close races in Michigan, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, with the matchups within the poll's 3.5% margin of error. Harris led among voters who had already cast their ballots by 8 percentage points, while Trump leads among voters who say they are very likely to vote but have not yet done so. The tied race in Pennsylvania shows Trump gaining momentum in a state Harris had previously led by four percentage points.

**Confidence and Panic: The State of Mind of Trump Supporters and Democrats**
Vivek Ramaswamy, a supporter of Donald Trump, has stated that New York is a 'pivot state', despite the fact that Kamala Harris is leading in the polls with 54.6% of the intentions of vote compared to 39.4% for Donald Trump. This confidence is reflected in the state of mind of many Trump supporters, who are predicting a landslide victory for the former president. Meanwhile, Democrats are nervous and anxious, with many of their strategists, candidates, and celebrities expressing their doubts and fears about the presidential campaign of Kamala Harris. According to a recent article by Axios, many Democrats are privately expressing their concerns that Harris may lose, despite the polls indicating a close race. 'Why are Democrats nervous? Because they are Democrats,' wrote Josh Marshall, editor-in-chief of Talking Points Memo, in 2020. 'Independently of objective realities, Democrats will always anticipate a defeat or worry about it, while Republicans will always be confident in their victory.' The 2022 midterm elections illustrated this phenomenon, with Republicans predicting a red wave that would give them a majority in both the House and Senate, while Democrats were worried about their chances. However, the final result showed that Democrats increased their majority in the Senate and limited their losses in the House. 'It's not a rule, but it's almost a law of American politics,' Marshall wrote. 'Donald Trump may win the election, but the current polls do not justify the triumphalism of some Republicans, nor do they justify the panic of some Democrats.'

**Trump vs. Harris: Who's Leading in New York?**
With just days to go before the US presidential elections on November 5, 2024, candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are intensifying their campaigns to win over voters and secure the White House for the 2024-2028 term. In New York, early voting has begun, and many residents have cast their ballots, showing strong support for presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who is leading by a significant margin in the state's polls. According to a Fivethirtyeight.com poll from October 29, Harris is leading Trump by +15.2 points, with 54.6% of voters intending to vote for her compared to 39.4% for Trump. This reflects strong support from New York citizens and some Latinos living in the state for the Democratic candidate and current Vice President Kamala Harris. If she wins, she will take all 28 of New York's electoral votes.

**How Donald J. Trump Can Win New York State**
Donald Trump's recent rally at Madison Square Garden was a huge success, with 20,000 seats sold out in 3 hours and tens of thousands watching on big screens outside. Experts may be writing off Trump's chances of winning New York State, but his campaign strategy, which includes visiting minority neighborhoods and speaking with locals, has shown promise. Trump's polling numbers in NYC have recently increased to 27%, and factoring in his history of under polling, he may be at 30% or higher. To win, Trump only needs to flip a little over half of those who voted for someone other than Lee Zeldin in the 2022 election, who were disaffected and angry over Democratic policies. As Trump has overcome odds steeper than this before, it's not impossible for him to win. 'Experts' writing off any chance of the former president winning the Empire State could be overlooking the 2022 run Lee Zeldin made against Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul, where Zeldin got 30% of the vote and lost by less than 6 points, after repeatedly saying that if he won 35% of the vote in NYC, he'd be NY's chief executive.

**Is Harris losing ground to Trump? What NYT/Siena poll says about popular vote**
The final poll before the 2024 US presidential election from The New York Times and Siena College shows Vice President Kamala Harris losing her 3 percentage point lead against former President Donald Trump. The latest polls found Harris deadlocked with Trump at 48% each, sparking predictions of Harris losing the popular vote to Trump. This would be the first time the Democratic ticket loses the popular vote since the last four elections. The poll also found that only 28% of respondents believe the US is heading in the right direction, which is negative for Harris' standing. The poll was conducted on October 20-23 with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Neck and Neck in Polls**
With just a few days left before the US presidential election on November 5, the contest between Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump remains intense. According to polls, the election is expected to be polarized, with both candidates neck and neck in the popular vote and key states. As reported by 'The New York Times' and 'FiveThirtyEight', the current projections indicate that Donald Trump has a slight advantage over Kamala Harris and would win the election. However, the outcome is still uncertain, and the election will likely be decided by individual votes. 'The New York Times' and 'FiveThirtyEight' use different methodologies, which may result in varying numbers. To win the election, a candidate needs to secure 270 out of 538 electoral votes. The candidate who wins the most votes in a state gets all of that state's electoral votes, regardless of the margin of victory. Currently, the polls indicate that Kamala Harris has a numerical advantage, but Donald Trump is leading in the national average. According to 'The New York Times', Kamala Harris has 49% of the vote, while Donald Trump has 48%. 'FiveThirtyEight' reports that Kamala Harris has 48.2% of the vote, while Donald Trump has 46.4%.

**Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in a Tight Race Ahead of 2024 US Presidential Election**
With less than three weeks to go before the 2024 US presidential election, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are neck and neck. According to recent polls by FiveThirtyEight, Harris leads Trump by 2.5 points, with 48.5% of the vote compared to 46.1% for the former president. However, Trump is gaining ground, and undecided voters may still play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the election. A map by 270towin shows that Trump is gaining support in states like Texas, Florida, and Minnesota, while Harris is losing ground in states like California, Illinois, and New York, although she is making gains in Oregon and Colorado.

**US Presidential Election: Who Will Win, Polls, and Voting Date**
With three weeks to go before the US presidential election, polls show Democratic candidate Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump by three to five percentage points. However, The New York Times notes that 'simple math proves the inevitable defeat of the Republican candidate.' But, as we know, Trump won in 2016, defying expectations. The paper suggests that the polls may have been flawed, with social scientists focusing on the wrong statistics or being influenced by their clients. The current polls show a three-percentage-point lead for Harris, but other surveys give Trump a 1.2% lead. The outcome of the election will depend on the number of electoral votes each candidate receives, with 583 votes in total. In most states, the winner takes all, so a candidate can win by a large margin but still lose the election. The current polls show Trump leading in six of the seven 'swing' states, but the margin is very small. The situation in these states will be crucial in determining the outcome of the election. Meanwhile, financial markets are predicting a Trump victory, with a 56% chance of him winning, according to the Polymarket website. 'This is a game of margins,' says Harris's advisor, David Plouffe. 'Any poll showing a 4-5 point lead for Harris or Trump in one of these seven states, ignore it.' The US presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024.

**Kamala Harris Leads Donald Trump in New York Polls**
As the US presidential election approaches on November 5, 2024, recent polls in New York have shown a significant lead for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris over Republican candidate Donald Trump. According to a poll by FiveThirtyEight, Harris has maintained a lead of over 14 percentage points since October 1, with 53.8% of the vote. The Hill's data collection, which began in August, shows a narrowing gap between the candidates, but Harris still leads by 16%. New York is considered a 'blue' state, where Democrats have historically received strong support. The state's 28 electoral votes are crucial in the election, as a candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win. Harris has been leading in several recent polls in New York, including a survey by ActiVote, which found that she leads Trump by 21.2% with 60.6% of the vote, while Trump has 39.4%. Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, noted that the economy is the top issue for 37% of New York voters, followed by affordability of housing, immigration, threats to democracy, and crime.

**Trump gains momentum for electoral victory in 2024**
Former President Donald Trump is gaining momentum in the 2024 US presidential election, with recent polling data suggesting he is on the verge of an electoral landslide. Trump is polling well in battleground states and even in historically Democratic strongholds like New York, where he is 13 points behind Vice President Kamala Harris, a 10-point improvement from the previous two elections. This shift in voter sentiment raises the possibility of Trump flipping multiple battleground states in his favor, setting up a potential return to the White House. While it is unlikely that Trump will win New York in 2024, the significant improvement in polling suggests a broader trend of rising support for the former president.

**Kamala Harris Leads Donald Trump in New York Polls**
According to recent polls, Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump in the state of New York, with a margin of 14 points, 55.7% to 41.9%, respectively. This is consistent with the results of the 2020 election, where Joe Biden won by 23 points. A recent Emerson College poll found that 54% of respondents would vote for Harris, while 40% would vote for Trump. Another poll by Siena College found similar results, with 55% of respondents supporting Harris and 42% supporting Trump. However, some polls, such as ActiVote, show a wider margin between the two candidates, with Harris leading by 17 points, 58% to 42%. Harris is leading among most demographic groups, including urban voters and those with higher levels of education. Trump is only leading among rural voters and those with lower levels of education, and among Republican voters, where he retains over 90% of their votes. The winner of the election in New York will receive all 29 electoral votes from the state.

**Polls suggest a 270-268 election result as Harris gains slight lead over Trump: Report**
A New York Times report suggests that the 2024 presidential election could result in a 270-268 outcome, with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris having a slight lead over former president Donald Trump. According to the report, Harris secured a one percentage point lead in Michigan, two in Wisconsin, and nine in Nebraska's Second Congressional District, while Trump led in Ohio by six points. The report notes that such a result would only be possible if the Times/Siena polls in every state prove to be accurate. Andrew Wroe, a professor in American politics at the University of Kent, stated, 'What they see is that swing-state polls show that race is much tighter than the national polls indicate.'

**US 2024: Latest NYT Poll Shows Close Race Between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump**
With the US presidential election approaching, the latest New York Times poll shows a close race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Harris initially seemed to be in the lead, but Trump has been gaining ground in recent weeks. The key battleground states will be Michigan and Wisconsin, where the polls show a tight race. In Michigan, Harris has 48% support among likely voters, while Trump has 47%, which is within the margin of error. In Wisconsin, Harris has 49% support, while Trump has 47%. However, Harris has a 9-point lead in Nebraska's Second Congressional District, which could be decisive in the Electoral College. If Harris wins Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, and Trump wins the Sun Belt states, Harris could win the election with the 270 electoral votes needed. As Harris said, 'the economy is the most important issue that sways voters', and Trump's persistence on economic issues has narrowed Harris's lead.

**Could We See a 270-268 Election? The Polls Are Tighter Than Ever.**
According to recent New York Times/Siena College polls, the 2024 presidential election is extremely close. If the polls were accurate, Kamala Harris would win the Electoral College with 270 votes, while Donald J. Trump would have 268. The average of six polls in core battleground states shows Trump leading by just 0.6 of a point. This is the closest modern U.S. presidential election in terms of electoral count. As Hillary Clinton noted, a modest lead is not a guarantee of victory, and neither Harris nor Trump can claim a clear lead in this election.

**Donald Trump Surges in Top Election Forecast**
According to the latest forecast from 538, Donald Trump's chances of beating Kamala Harris in the 2024 election have improved, although Harris is still considered the slight favorite overall. Harris has a 55-in-100 chance of winning the majority of the Electoral College votes, with Trump given a 45-in-100 chance. This is an improvement from the 39 percent chance Trump was given on September 17, while Harris has dropped from a 61 percent chance of victory. G. Elliott Morris from 538 said, 'Harris' current lead in the race is 'barely better than a coin flip.' Slim margins in the swing states make this cycle's presidential race the closest in decades, with the outcome potentially being closer than in any election in nearly 150 years.' The New York Times/Siena poll shows Trump leading in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, while Harris can afford to lose these states if she wins the three 'blue wall' swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The Quinnipiac University poll shows Trump with a 1 point lead over Harris in a full ballot, and the pair are tied on 48 percent in a two-way race. The poll also shows a decline in enthusiasm among Harris supporters, with 70 percent saying they are 'very enthusiastic' about voting for her, compared to 71 percent of Trump supporters.

According to a New York Times/Siena College poll, Donald Trump has surged ahead in Arizona, maintaining a four-point lead in Georgia and holding steady in North Carolina.

In North Carolina, Trump is up two points (49-47 percent), while in Georgia, he maintains a four-point lead (49-45 percent). The polls sampled 713 registered voters in Arizona, 682 in Georgia, and 682 in North Carolina, with a margin of error of 4.4-4.6 percentage points. Analysts say that North Carolina and Georgia are essential to Trump's hopes of returning to the White House, and that Harris could win even while losing all three states, though it would be difficult.

**Clear Winner? Donald Trump Narrows Gap with Kamala Harris in New York, Poll Shows Democratic Stronghold Weakening**
A recent Siena College poll shows a surprising shift in voter sentiment in New York, with former President Donald Trump trailing Vice President Kamala Harris by only 12 points. This marks a significant departure from the 2020 election, when Joe Biden carried the state by a 23% margin. According to the poll, Harris could be poised to deliver the weakest Democratic performance in New York since 1988. As Democrats face mounting pressure to reinforce their positions in key states, Harris's ability to maintain strong support in New York could prove critical in the 2024 election. As one observer notes, 'New York has long been a Democratic stronghold, but the narrowing margin underscores challenges for Harris in solidifying the base.'

**Trump stumps on Long Island, vowing to ‘win New York' after losing big twice**
Donald Trump held a rally in Uniondale, New York, vowing to 'win New York' in the 2024 presidential election. Despite losing the state by more than 20 points in 2016 and 2020, Trump insisted that he can win, saying 'I can win New York, and we can win New York.' Election analysts do not regard New York as a competitive state, but Trump's campaign is trying to shore up GOP voters who are skeptical of him. Trump thanked vulnerable Republican representatives and cited surveys showing rank-and-file support in the Teamsters union, which he claimed sided with him. He also repeated his claims of a 'third-world nation' and 'invasion' at the US-Mexico border, and defended his 2016 pitch to Black voters, which was widely viewed as offensive. Trump also used the rally to recount Sunday's apparent assassination attempt and blamed Democrats for using language that he claims is a threat to democracy.

**Trump prepares to prove his New York prediction wrong for the third time**
Donald Trump has repeatedly predicted that he will win New York's electoral votes in his presidential bids, despite losing the state by more than 20 points in both 2016 and 2020. In an interview with the New York Post, Trump said, 'I'll solve the crime problem. I'll solve their tax problem. I'll solve all their problems. Who would not vote for me?' However, Trump went on to lose by more than 20 points again. A new poll by Siena College shows Trump trailing Vice President Kamala Harris by 13 points in the state, which is closer than the results of actual voting have been over the past two decades. Trump's optimism is likely rooted in the Republican Party's success in the state in 2022, but it's unlikely that he will win New York this time around, given the state's history of favoring Democratic candidates.

**Trump makes a bold prediction about the 2024 presidential election**
Former President Donald Trump predicted victory in the 2024 presidential election, specifically in the reliably blue state of New York, saying 'We are going to win New York. And that's the first time in many, many years that a Republican can honestly say it.' Trump made a similar pledge four years ago, but lost the state to President Biden by over 23 points. Polling suggests Trump has no serious chance of carrying New York in his 2024 election showdown with Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump promised New Yorkers that if he wins back the White House, 'I'm going to reduce your taxes, reduce your crime, and reduce your levels of stress.' The rally was seen as an opportunity to make efficient use of Trump's time, as his campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said, 'when [Trump] delivers a message there, it's piped directly into homes in every market in every battleground state.' While Trump is unlikely to carry New York, the rally may help Republicans down-ballot, as they try to hold on to their House of Representatives majority in November's elections.

Donald Trump held a rally in Uniondale, New York, vowing to 'win New York' in the 2024 presidential election. Despite losing the state by more than 20 points in 2016 and 2020, Trump insisted that he can win this time. He mocked his doubters, saying 'I said, 'I can win New York, and we can win New York.' We're going to win,' he said. However, election analysts do not regard New York as a competitive state, and Trump's claims have been met with skepticism. Trump also used the rally to defend his past comments on immigration and crime, and to attack his opponents, including Vice President Kamala Harris. He repeated misrepresentations about Harris's record and blamed Democrats for a recent assassination attempt on him. Trump also fundraised during his visit and held meetings with donors. 'New York is sending Donald Trump back with a Republican Congress to work with,' former Rep. Lee Zeldin said in one of the warm-up speeches before Trump. 'New York was a battleground in 2022, and New York is a battleground again in 2024.'

**Trump: I'll Do What GOP Has Not Done Since '84, Win N.Y.**
Former President Donald Trump said he will campaign in New York, a state no Republican presidential candidate has carried since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Trump told a rally in Uniondale, New York, 'I said, I can win New York, and we can win New York.' He claimed that with his vote, they will 'rescue our country, rescue our Democrat-run states, and start by saving the great state of New York.' Trump lost New York by nearly 23 percentage points in both 2016 and 2020, but Republicans have been buoyed by flipping four New York House seats in the 2022 midterms and the performance of former Rep. Lee Zeldin, who lost to Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul by 6.2 points in 2022. Trump said, 'Our cities were the center of business, arts, culture. Our streets, ports, waterways were the arteries of American commerce. But look at what has happened to New York and the other states all run by radical left Democrats.' He highlighted the issues in New York, including a 29% increase in robbery, a 36% increase in felony assault, a 42% increase in grand larceny, and a 75% increase in carjackings. Trump then used a slogan he used in 2016, saying, 'So, I say to the people of New York with crime at record levels, with terrorists and criminals pouring in, and with inflation eating your hearts out, vote for Donald Trump. What the hell do you have to lose?'

**Trump Declares He'll Win State He Lost by 23 Points Twice: 'We're Gonna Win New York!'**
Former President Donald Trump held a campaign rally in New York, stating that he will win the state in the upcoming general election. Trump lost New York by 23 points in 2016 and 2020, but said, 'We're going to win New York!' and 'I can win New York and we can win New York.' He pledged to reduce taxes, crime, and stress, while increasing incomes and love for the state. However, a poll conducted in August shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Trump by 16 points. This was Trump's second rally in New York in recent months.

**The Brutal Polling Is Starting to Irritate Liberals and It's Fantastic to Watch**
The 2024 presidential election is heating up, with Donald Trump leading in the polls. According to Nate Silver's projection, Trump has a 64% chance of winning 270 electoral votes. Recent polls, including a Pew national poll, show the race tied nationally, which would likely translate to a loss for Kamala Harris in the Electoral College. The New York Times and Pew polls also indicate that Trump is on track to win. CNN's Harry Enten noted that if Trump outperforms his polling by a single point, he would win. ABC News' Matthew Dowd attempted to downplay the polls, but Nate Silver dismissed his claims as a coping mechanism. The article concludes that Harris' record and agenda are liabilities, and that her lack of trustworthiness and grasp of issues are major concerns.

**Trump and Harris Tied in Final Weeks of 2024 Election, Poll Shows**
According to a national poll conducted by The New York Times and Siena College, presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are effectively tied in the final weeks of the 2024 election. Trump leads Harris by a single point, 48%-47%, with a margin of error of three points, making either candidate's victory possible on November 5th. The poll suggests that Trump's base of support remains strong, with 28% of likely voters saying they need more information about Harris, compared to only 9% saying the same about Trump. The debate on Tuesday could be a crucial moment, with Harris having the opportunity to provide more details on her policies while facing off against Trump for 90 minutes. The poll's findings are similar to those of the last comparable poll from the New York Times/Siena College, published in late July, where Trump also led by a single point. Polls in the seven key swing states that will likely determine the election winner have also shown a very close race.

**Trump takes narrow lead in NYT poll amid fears Kamala's 'honeymoon' is collapsing**
A New York Times/Siena College poll conducted September 3-6 shows Donald Trump leading Kamala Harris by 1 percent, 48 percent to 47 percent, within the 3-point margin of error. The poll suggests that despite Harris' 'honeymoon phase,' support for Trump's bid for a second, nonconsecutive White House term remains strong. In the seven swing states key to winning the 2024 election, Trump and Harris are neck-and-neck or within the margin of error. The two candidates will meet for their first debate on September 10 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, hosted by ABC News. With only eight weeks until Election Day on November 5, many MAGA supporters and Republicans claim that Harris' polling and enthusiasm bump are part of a honeymoon phase and will wear off before voters cast their ballots.

**Harris or Trump? What the polls are saying a day before the 2024 election**
The 2024 presidential election is one day away, and the final batch of polls shows a tight race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. According to the Yahoo News/YouGov surveys, Harris and Trump are tied at 47% among registered voters, a first since Harris declared her candidacy. A new Des Moines Register poll in Iowa shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters, a significant shift from June when Trump had an 18-point lead. 'It's hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,' said J. Ann Selzer, the pollster. 'She has clearly leaped into a leading position.' The polls in the seven battleground states also show a close contest, with Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania being critical for Harris. Nate Cohn, the Times chief pollster, noted that 'in the history of modern polling, there's never been a race where the final polls showed such a close contest.'

**Trump and Harris in a tight race in the 7 battleground states: NYT/Siena poll By Investing.com**
The presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald J. Trump is extremely close, with the New York Times and Siena College poll indicating that Harris is gaining momentum in North Carolina and Georgia, while Trump is narrowing her lead in Pennsylvania and maintaining an advantage in Arizona. Harris holds slight leads in Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, while Trump leads in Arizona. The margins in these seven states are within the polls' sampling error, making it difficult to determine a definitive lead. Recent undecided voters may be leaning towards Harris, with a 55-44 lead among those who decided on their vote within the last few weeks. However, Trump shows strength among voters who intend to vote but have not yet done so.

**US Presidential Election: Pennsylvania Key to Harris or Trump's Victory**
The 2024 US presidential election is expected to be one of the closest and most contentious in American history. According to a New York Times public opinion tracker, as of Sunday, all seven swing states were roughly tied. Trump had a 3-point lead in Arizona, while the other six states were within one point of each other. The election is expected to be decided by a small margin, with 43,000 votes making the difference in 2020. Pennsylvania, with 19 electoral votes, is the most crucial state in the seven swing states. If Harris loses Pennsylvania, she would need to win North Carolina or Georgia, which have voted for Democratic candidates only three times in the past four decades. On the other hand, if Trump loses Pennsylvania, he would need to win Wisconsin or Michigan, which have voted for Republican candidates only once in the past four decades. Both Harris and Trump have focused heavily on Pennsylvania, with the two campaigns and their allies spending $279.3 million on advertising in the state, more than in any other state. The outcome of the election will depend on the results in these seven swing states, with the winner needing to secure 270 electoral votes out of 538 to win the presidency.

**Here's the key to reading the tight polls and predicting a Trump win**
The author of a New York Post piece predicting Donald Trump's win in the 2024 presidential election explains how they derived their numbers. They argue that the key to reading tight polls is understanding the balance between Democrats and Republicans among voters, or partisan preference. The author notes that pollsters use weighting methods to adjust for demographic differences, but these methods can be flawed. They use data from two recent national polls to show how different weighting methods can produce different results. The author then averages the findings of each poll to estimate the partisan breakdown, which shows Harris leading with Democrats by 89 points and Trump leading with Republicans by 87 points. They use this estimate to compute the national popular vote totals under different partisan scenarios, concluding that Trump would win the popular vote by a 0.46-point margin in an R+2 electorate. The author predicts the popular vote percentages, with Harris winning by 1.3 points, and uses this to call the Electoral College. They argue that Trump would carry every swing state, giving him 312 electoral votes to Harris' 229. However, they mention three reasons why Harris could still win: a D-friendly electorate, Harris doing better with independents, or a dramatic reduction in the Electoral College gap. They reject each of these possibilities, citing data on voter registration and poll analysis. The author concludes that the cumulative weight of the evidence suggests Trump has the better chance of prevailing.

**Confidence and Panic: The State of Mind of Trump Supporters and Democrats**
Vivek Ramaswamy, a supporter of Donald Trump, has stated that New York is a 'pivot state', despite the fact that Kamala Harris is leading in the polls with 54.6% of the intentions of vote compared to 39.4% for Donald Trump. This confidence is reflected in the state of mind of many Trump supporters, who are predicting a landslide victory for the former president. Meanwhile, Democrats are nervous and anxious, with many of their strategists, candidates, and celebrities expressing their doubts and fears about the presidential campaign of Kamala Harris. According to a recent article by Axios, many Democrats are privately expressing their concerns that Harris may lose, despite the polls indicating a close race. 'Why are Democrats nervous? Because they are Democrats,' wrote Josh Marshall, editor-in-chief of Talking Points Memo, in 2020. 'Independently of objective realities, Democrats will always anticipate a defeat or worry about it, while Republicans will always be confident in their victory.' The 2022 midterm elections illustrated this phenomenon, with Republicans predicting a red wave that would give them a majority in both the House and Senate, while Democrats were worried about their chances. However, the final result showed that Democrats increased their majority in the Senate and limited their losses in the House. 'It's not a rule, but it's almost a law of American politics,' Marshall wrote. 'Donald Trump may win the election, but the current polls do not justify the triumphalism of some Republicans, nor do they justify the panic of some Democrats.'

**Trump vs. Harris: Who's Leading in New York?**
With just days to go before the US presidential elections on November 5, 2024, candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are intensifying their campaigns to win over voters and secure the White House for the 2024-2028 term. In New York, early voting has begun, and many residents have cast their ballots, showing strong support for presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who is leading by a significant margin in the state's polls. According to a Fivethirtyeight.com poll from October 29, Harris is leading Trump by +15.2 points, with 54.6% of voters intending to vote for her compared to 39.4% for Trump. This reflects strong support from New York citizens and some Latinos living in the state for the Democratic candidate and current Vice President Kamala Harris. If she wins, she will take all 28 of New York's electoral votes.

**How Donald J. Trump Can Win New York State**
Donald Trump's recent rally at Madison Square Garden was a huge success, with 20,000 seats sold out in 3 hours and tens of thousands watching on big screens outside. Experts may be writing off Trump's chances of winning New York State, but his campaign strategy, which includes visiting minority neighborhoods and speaking with locals, has shown promise. Trump's polling numbers in NYC have recently increased to 27%, and factoring in his history of under polling, he may be at 30% or higher. To win, Trump only needs to flip a little over half of those who voted for someone other than Lee Zeldin in the 2022 election, who were disaffected and angry over Democratic policies. As Trump has overcome odds steeper than this before, it's not impossible for him to win. 'Experts' writing off any chance of the former president winning the Empire State could be overlooking the 2022 run Lee Zeldin made against Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul, where Zeldin got 30% of the vote and lost by less than 6 points, after repeatedly saying that if he won 35% of the vote in NYC, he'd be NY's chief executive.

**Is Harris losing ground to Trump? What NYT/Siena poll says about popular vote**
The final poll before the 2024 US presidential election from The New York Times and Siena College shows Vice President Kamala Harris losing her 3 percentage point lead against former President Donald Trump. The latest polls found Harris deadlocked with Trump at 48% each, sparking predictions of Harris losing the popular vote to Trump. This would be the first time the Democratic ticket loses the popular vote since the last four elections. The poll also found that only 28% of respondents believe the US is heading in the right direction, which is negative for Harris' standing. The poll was conducted on October 20-23 with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Neck and Neck in Polls**
With just a few days left before the US presidential election on November 5, the contest between Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump remains intense. According to polls, the election is expected to be polarized, with both candidates neck and neck in the popular vote and key states. As reported by 'The New York Times' and 'FiveThirtyEight', the current projections indicate that Donald Trump has a slight advantage over Kamala Harris and would win the election. However, the outcome is still uncertain, and the election will likely be decided by individual votes. 'The New York Times' and 'FiveThirtyEight' use different methodologies, which may result in varying numbers. To win the election, a candidate needs to secure 270 out of 538 electoral votes. The candidate who wins the most votes in a state gets all of that state's electoral votes, regardless of the margin of victory. Currently, the polls indicate that Kamala Harris has a numerical advantage, but Donald Trump is leading in the national average. According to 'The New York Times', Kamala Harris has 49% of the vote, while Donald Trump has 48%. 'FiveThirtyEight' reports that Kamala Harris has 48.2% of the vote, while Donald Trump has 46.4%.

**Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in a Tight Race Ahead of 2024 US Presidential Election**
With less than three weeks to go before the 2024 US presidential election, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are neck and neck. According to recent polls by FiveThirtyEight, Harris leads Trump by 2.5 points, with 48.5% of the vote compared to 46.1% for the former president. However, Trump is gaining ground, and undecided voters may still play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the election. A map by 270towin shows that Trump is gaining support in states like Texas, Florida, and Minnesota, while Harris is losing ground in states like California, Illinois, and New York, although she is making gains in Oregon and Colorado.

**US Presidential Election: Who Will Win, Polls, and Voting Date**
With three weeks to go before the US presidential election, polls show Democratic candidate Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump by three to five percentage points. However, The New York Times notes that 'simple math proves the inevitable defeat of the Republican candidate.' But, as we know, Trump won in 2016, defying expectations. The paper suggests that the polls may have been flawed, with social scientists focusing on the wrong statistics or being influenced by their clients. The current polls show a three-percentage-point lead for Harris, but other surveys give Trump a 1.2% lead. The outcome of the election will depend on the number of electoral votes each candidate receives, with 583 votes in total. In most states, the winner takes all, so a candidate can win by a large margin but still lose the election. The current polls show Trump leading in six of the seven 'swing' states, but the margin is very small. The situation in these states will be crucial in determining the outcome of the election. Meanwhile, financial markets are predicting a Trump victory, with a 56% chance of him winning, according to the Polymarket website. 'This is a game of margins,' says Harris's advisor, David Plouffe. 'Any poll showing a 4-5 point lead for Harris or Trump in one of these seven states, ignore it.' The US presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024.

**Kamala Harris Leads Donald Trump in New York Polls**
As the US presidential election approaches on November 5, 2024, recent polls in New York have shown a significant lead for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris over Republican candidate Donald Trump. According to a poll by FiveThirtyEight, Harris has maintained a lead of over 14 percentage points since October 1, with 53.8% of the vote. The Hill's data collection, which began in August, shows a narrowing gap between the candidates, but Harris still leads by 16%. New York is considered a 'blue' state, where Democrats have historically received strong support. The state's 28 electoral votes are crucial in the election, as a candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win. Harris has been leading in several recent polls in New York, including a survey by ActiVote, which found that she leads Trump by 21.2% with 60.6% of the vote, while Trump has 39.4%. Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, noted that the economy is the top issue for 37% of New York voters, followed by affordability of housing, immigration, threats to democracy, and crime.

**Trump gains momentum for electoral victory in 2024**
Former President Donald Trump is gaining momentum in the 2024 US presidential election, with recent polling data suggesting he is on the verge of an electoral landslide. Trump is polling well in battleground states and even in historically Democratic strongholds like New York, where he is 13 points behind Vice President Kamala Harris, a 10-point improvement from the previous two elections. This shift in voter sentiment raises the possibility of Trump flipping multiple battleground states in his favor, setting up a potential return to the White House. While it is unlikely that Trump will win New York in 2024, the significant improvement in polling suggests a broader trend of rising support for the former president.

**Kamala Harris Leads Donald Trump in New York Polls**
According to recent polls, Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump in the state of New York, with a margin of 14 points, 55.7% to 41.9%, respectively. This is consistent with the results of the 2020 election, where Joe Biden won by 23 points. A recent Emerson College poll found that 54% of respondents would vote for Harris, while 40% would vote for Trump. Another poll by Siena College found similar results, with 55% of respondents supporting Harris and 42% supporting Trump. However, some polls, such as ActiVote, show a wider margin between the two candidates, with Harris leading by 17 points, 58% to 42%. Harris is leading among most demographic groups, including urban voters and those with higher levels of education. Trump is only leading among rural voters and those with lower levels of education, and among Republican voters, where he retains over 90% of their votes. The winner of the election in New York will receive all 29 electoral votes from the state.

**Polls suggest a 270-268 election result as Harris gains slight lead over Trump: Report**
A New York Times report suggests that the 2024 presidential election could result in a 270-268 outcome, with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris having a slight lead over former president Donald Trump. According to the report, Harris secured a one percentage point lead in Michigan, two in Wisconsin, and nine in Nebraska's Second Congressional District, while Trump led in Ohio by six points. The report notes that such a result would only be possible if the Times/Siena polls in every state prove to be accurate. Andrew Wroe, a professor in American politics at the University of Kent, stated, 'What they see is that swing-state polls show that race is much tighter than the national polls indicate.'

**US 2024: Latest NYT Poll Shows Close Race Between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump**
With the US presidential election approaching, the latest New York Times poll shows a close race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Harris initially seemed to be in the lead, but Trump has been gaining ground in recent weeks. The key battleground states will be Michigan and Wisconsin, where the polls show a tight race. In Michigan, Harris has 48% support among likely voters, while Trump has 47%, which is within the margin of error. In Wisconsin, Harris has 49% support, while Trump has 47%. However, Harris has a 9-point lead in Nebraska's Second Congressional District, which could be decisive in the Electoral College. If Harris wins Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, and Trump wins the Sun Belt states, Harris could win the election with the 270 electoral votes needed. As Harris said, 'the economy is the most important issue that sways voters', and Trump's persistence on economic issues has narrowed Harris's lead.

**Could We See a 270-268 Election? The Polls Are Tighter Than Ever.**
According to recent New York Times/Siena College polls, the 2024 presidential election is extremely close. If the polls were accurate, Kamala Harris would win the Electoral College with 270 votes, while Donald J. Trump would have 268. The average of six polls in core battleground states shows Trump leading by just 0.6 of a point. This is the closest modern U.S. presidential election in terms of electoral count. As Hillary Clinton noted, a modest lead is not a guarantee of victory, and neither Harris nor Trump can claim a clear lead in this election.

**Donald Trump Surges in Top Election Forecast**
According to the latest forecast from 538, Donald Trump's chances of beating Kamala Harris in the 2024 election have improved, although Harris is still considered the slight favorite overall. Harris has a 55-in-100 chance of winning the majority of the Electoral College votes, with Trump given a 45-in-100 chance. This is an improvement from the 39 percent chance Trump was given on September 17, while Harris has dropped from a 61 percent chance of victory. G. Elliott Morris from 538 said, 'Harris' current lead in the race is 'barely better than a coin flip.' Slim margins in the swing states make this cycle's presidential race the closest in decades, with the outcome potentially being closer than in any election in nearly 150 years.' The New York Times/Siena poll shows Trump leading in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, while Harris can afford to lose these states if she wins the three 'blue wall' swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The Quinnipiac University poll shows Trump with a 1 point lead over Harris in a full ballot, and the pair are tied on 48 percent in a two-way race. The poll also shows a decline in enthusiasm among Harris supporters, with 70 percent saying they are 'very enthusiastic' about voting for her, compared to 71 percent of Trump supporters.

**NYT Polls: Donald Trump Leads in Sun Belt States of N.C., GA, Arizona**
According to a New York Times/Siena College poll, Donald Trump has surged ahead in Arizona, maintaining a four-point lead in Georgia and holding steady in North Carolina. Trump's lead in Arizona is five points (50-45 percent) over Vice President Kamala Harris, who is struggling with Latino voters. In North Carolina, Trump is up two points (49-47 percent), while in Georgia, he maintains a four-point lead (49-45 percent). The polls sampled 713 registered voters in Arizona, 682 in Georgia, and 682 in North Carolina, with a margin of error of 4.4-4.6 percentage points. Analysts say that North Carolina and Georgia are essential to Trump's hopes of returning to the White House, and that Harris could win even while losing all three states, though it would be difficult.

**Clear Winner? Donald Trump Narrows Gap with Kamala Harris in New York, Poll Shows Democratic Stronghold Weakening**
A recent Siena College poll shows a surprising shift in voter sentiment in New York, with former President Donald Trump trailing Vice President Kamala Harris by only 12 points. This marks a significant departure from the 2020 election, when Joe Biden carried the state by a 23% margin. According to the poll, Harris could be poised to deliver the weakest Democratic performance in New York since 1988. As Democrats face mounting pressure to reinforce their positions in key states, Harris's ability to maintain strong support in New York could prove critical in the 2024 election. As one observer notes, 'New York has long been a Democratic stronghold, but the narrowing margin underscores challenges for Harris in solidifying the base.'

**Trump stumps on Long Island, vowing to ‘win New York' after losing big twice**
Donald Trump held a rally in Uniondale, New York, vowing to 'win New York' in the 2024 presidential election. Despite losing the state by more than 20 points in 2016 and 2020, Trump insisted that he can win, saying 'I can win New York, and we can win New York.' Election analysts do not regard New York as a competitive state, but Trump's campaign is trying to shore up GOP voters who are skeptical of him. Trump thanked vulnerable Republican representatives and cited surveys showing rank-and-file support in the Teamsters union, which he claimed sided with him. He also repeated his claims of a 'third-world nation' and 'invasion' at the US-Mexico border, and defended his 2016 pitch to Black voters, which was widely viewed as offensive. Trump also used the rally to recount Sunday's apparent assassination attempt and blamed Democrats for using language that he claims is a threat to democracy.

**Trump prepares to prove his New York prediction wrong for the third time**
Donald Trump has repeatedly predicted that he will win New York's electoral votes in his presidential bids, despite losing the state by more than 20 points in both 2016 and 2020. In an interview with the New York Post, Trump said, 'I'll solve the crime problem. I'll solve their tax problem. I'll solve all their problems. Who would not vote for me?' However, Trump went on to lose by more than 20 points again. A new poll by Siena College shows Trump trailing Vice President Kamala Harris by 13 points in the state, which is closer than the results of actual voting have been over the past two decades. Trump's optimism is likely rooted in the Republican Party's success in the state in 2022, but it's unlikely that he will win New York this time around, given the state's history of favoring Democratic candidates.

**Trump makes a bold prediction about the 2024 presidential election**
Former President Donald Trump predicted victory in the 2024 presidential election, specifically in the reliably blue state of New York, saying 'We are going to win New York. And that's the first time in many, many years that a Republican can honestly say it.' Trump made a similar pledge four years ago, but lost the state to President Biden by over 23 points. Polling suggests Trump has no serious chance of carrying New York in his 2024 election showdown with Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump promised New Yorkers that if he wins back the White House, 'I'm going to reduce your taxes, reduce your crime, and reduce your levels of stress.' The rally was seen as an opportunity to make efficient use of Trump's time, as his campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said, 'when [Trump] delivers a message there, it's piped directly into homes in every market in every battleground state.' While Trump is unlikely to carry New York, the rally may help Republicans down-ballot, as they try to hold on to their House of Representatives majority in November's elections.

Donald Trump held a rally in Uniondale, New York, vowing to 'win New York' in the 2024 presidential election. Despite losing the state by more than 20 points in 2016 and 2020, Trump insisted that he can win this time. He mocked his doubters, saying 'I said, 'I can win New York, and we can win New York.' We're going to win,' he said. However, election analysts do not regard New York as a competitive state, and Trump's claims have been met with skepticism. Trump also used the rally to defend his past comments on immigration and crime, and to attack his opponents, including Vice President Kamala Harris. He repeated misrepresentations about Harris's record and blamed Democrats for a recent assassination attempt on him. Trump also fundraised during his visit and held meetings with donors. 'New York is sending Donald Trump back with a Republican Congress to work with,' former Rep. Lee Zeldin said in one of the warm-up speeches before Trump. 'New York was a battleground in 2022, and New York is a battleground again in 2024.'

**Trump: I'll Do What GOP Has Not Done Since '84, Win N.Y.**
Former President Donald Trump said he will campaign in New York, a state no Republican presidential candidate has carried since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Trump told a rally in Uniondale, New York, 'I said, I can win New York, and we can win New York.' He claimed that with his vote, they will 'rescue our country, rescue our Democrat-run states, and start by saving the great state of New York.' Trump lost New York by nearly 23 percentage points in both 2016 and 2020, but Republicans have been buoyed by flipping four New York House seats in the 2022 midterms and the performance of former Rep. Lee Zeldin, who lost to Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul by 6.2 points in 2022. Trump said, 'Our cities were the center of business, arts, culture. Our streets, ports, waterways were the arteries of American commerce. But look at what has happened to New York and the other states all run by radical left Democrats.' He highlighted the issues in New York, including a 29% increase in robbery, a 36% increase in felony assault, a 42% increase in grand larceny, and a 75% increase in carjackings. Trump then used a slogan he used in 2016, saying, 'So, I say to the people of New York with crime at record levels, with terrorists and criminals pouring in, and with inflation eating your hearts out, vote for Donald Trump. What the hell do you have to lose?'

**Trump Declares He'll Win State He Lost by 23 Points Twice: 'We're Gonna Win New York!'**
Former President Donald Trump held a campaign rally in New York, stating that he will win the state in the upcoming general election. Trump lost New York by 23 points in 2016 and 2020, but said, 'We're going to win New York!' and 'I can win New York and we can win New York.' He pledged to reduce taxes, crime, and stress, while increasing incomes and love for the state. However, a poll conducted in August shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Trump by 16 points. This was Trump's second rally in New York in recent months.

**The Brutal Polling Is Starting to Irritate Liberals and It's Fantastic to Watch**
The 2024 presidential election is heating up, with Donald Trump leading in the polls. According to Nate Silver's projection, Trump has a 64% chance of winning 270 electoral votes. Recent polls, including a Pew national poll, show the race tied nationally, which would likely translate to a loss for Kamala Harris in the Electoral College. The New York Times and Pew polls also indicate that Trump is on track to win. CNN's Harry Enten noted that if Trump outperforms his polling by a single point, he would win. ABC News' Matthew Dowd attempted to downplay the polls, but Nate Silver dismissed his claims as a coping mechanism. The article concludes that Harris' record and agenda are liabilities, and that her lack of trustworthiness and grasp of issues are major concerns.

**Trump and Harris Tied in Final Weeks of 2024 Election, Poll Shows**
According to a national poll conducted by The New York Times and Siena College, presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are effectively tied in the final weeks of the 2024 election. Trump leads Harris by a single point, 48%-47%, with a margin of error of three points, making either candidate's victory possible on November 5th. The poll suggests that Trump's base of support remains strong, with 28% of likely voters saying they need more information about Harris, compared to only 9% saying the same about Trump. The debate on Tuesday could be a crucial moment, with Harris having the opportunity to provide more details on her policies while facing off against Trump for 90 minutes. The poll's findings are similar to those of the last comparable poll from the New York Times/Siena College, published in late July, where Trump also led by a single point. Polls in the seven key swing states that will likely determine the election winner have also shown a very close race.

**Trump takes narrow lead in NYT poll amid fears Kamala's 'honeymoon' is collapsing**
A New York Times/Siena College poll conducted September 3-6 shows Donald Trump leading Kamala Harris by 1 percent, 48 percent to 47 percent, within the 3-point margin of error. The poll suggests that despite Harris' 'honeymoon phase,' support for Trump's bid for a second, nonconsecutive White House term remains strong. In the seven swing states key to winning the 2024 election, Trump and Harris are neck-and-neck or within the margin of error. The two candidates will meet for their first debate on September 10 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, hosted by ABC News. With only eight weeks until Election Day on November 5, many MAGA supporters and Republicans claim that Harris' polling and enthusiasm bump are part of a honeymoon phase and will wear off before voters cast their ballots.
