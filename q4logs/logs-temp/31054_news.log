**Cold front with squally showers passes ahead of the weekend but how chilly will it get?**
A cold front is expected to pass through South Florida ahead of the weekend, bringing clear skies and dry air. National Weather Service meteorologists predict the mercury to drop into the mid-50s on Friday and Saturday nights, with daytime highs near 70 degrees through Sunday. Cooler overnight temperatures in the low 50s are possible in western areas of Palm Beach County. The rain chances fall to 30% on Thursday night and then drop to near 0 on Saturday, with downpours and rainfall totals of up to 3 inches possible in South Florida. Ana Torres-Vazquez, a meteorologist with the NWS office in Miami, said, 'It's looking like it's not going to be the strongest front of the season and there is still some uncertainty on timing.' The rain may be welcome, as nearly the entire Peninsula and Panhandle are considered either abnormally dry or suffering moderate drought. 'Because the rain will be falling over about a 72-hour time period, widespread flooding is unlikely, but there is a potential for localized flooding,' Torres-Vazquez said.

**Beneficial Rainfall Conditions Predicted for Crop Development**
According to recent forecasts, December 2024 is expected to bring variable rainfall distribution across the country, with moderate to high precipitation accumulations of 30-60 mm in the northern and northeastern regions. Experts explained, 'These conditions will be beneficial for crops, as they will contribute to maintaining an adequate soil moisture availability, especially for crops in critical development stages.' However, they also warned that the risk of excessive moisture should not be overlooked, as it can lead to the proliferation of plant diseases. To mitigate these risks, agricultural institutions recommended that producers conduct regular monitoring to identify potential infestation hotspots and implement optimized measures to protect crop productivity.

**Severe Winter Storms to Hit US in December 2024**
A severe winter storm is affecting parts of the United States, with some areas receiving up to 45 cm of snow. The National Weather Service has reported that the snowfall is due to the 'lake effect', a common phenomenon in the Great Lakes region during the winter months. According to the National Weather Service, the snowfall will continue throughout December, with some areas expecting up to 50 cm of snow. The storm has caused difficulties for drivers, who have reported reduced visibility. Illinois, particularly Chicago, is also expected to experience hazardous road conditions, with the National Weather Service warning of slippery roads and reduced visibility. Meteorologist Alicia Roman stated, 'There will be a lot of snow and the mixture with rain will combine with winds of up to 45 km/h. Drivers will definitely have reduced visibility and the winds will blow around unsecured objects, so branches of trees will likely be easily knocked down.'

**Fenómeno de 'La Niña': ¿Cuándo será su impacto en México y qué provocará?**
The 'La Niña' phenomenon, characterized by a large-scale cooling of the ocean surface, is expected to have a significant impact on Mexico's climate. According to experts, the phenomenon is likely to develop in late 2024 or early 2025, with potential effects lasting until spring. The 'La Niña' phenomenon can bring extreme cold, snow, and polar air, with a 57% chance of this occurring between December 2024 and January 2025, according to a recent report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The north of Mexico tends to experience drier conditions during 'La Niña', which can affect agriculture, water availability, and increase the risk of forest fires. In contrast, the southern and southeastern regions of Mexico typically receive more rainfall during 'La Niña', which can lead to flooding and landslides. Robert Molleda, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Miami, notes that the combination of 'La Niña' in the Pacific and the warm waters of the Atlantic can lead to an increase in hurricanes in the Atlantic basin. 'La Niña' is a climate pattern that occurs in the tropical Pacific Ocean, characterized by cooler-than-normal sea surface temperatures in the equatorial region. This disrupts global climate patterns, influencing temperatures and precipitation in various regions worldwide. The phenomenon does not follow a fixed interval, but generally occurs every 2 to 7 years. The last time a similar event occurred was between 2020-2021.

**Long lines at MIA as bad weather threatens to snarl travel plans across US ahead of Thanksgiving**
Bad weather is threatening to disrupt travel plans across the US ahead of Thanksgiving, with long lines at Miami International Airport and severe weather conditions in other parts of the country. In Northern California, over 20 inches of rain fell in some areas, while in the western US, more winter alerts were issued. In the eastern part of the country, drivers are dealing with treacherous conditions on the roads, with some areas expecting up to two feet of snow by Saturday night. According to AAA, nearly 80 million people will travel 50 miles or more this week, a new record, and the Transportation Security Administration expects a record-breaking 18 million-plus passengers will fly between this coming Tuesday and Dec. 2. Travelers are advised to prepare for delays and have an emergency kit inside their vehicles. As one traveler, Kate Hansalman, said, 'So far, it’s been really smooth. I mean, I think we’re ahead of schedule enough that we’re probably not hitting too much of the holiday traffic, which is nice, but I assume probably later this week, it will get busier.'

**La Niña expected to deliver warmer, drier South Florida winter**
A weak and short-lived La Niña is expected to emerge in December, leading to a warmer and drier winter in South Florida. According to Robert Molleda, chief meteorologist for the National Weather Service's Miami office, 'So warmer and drier from now all the way through April. In fact, the models are indicating that it's possible that the February to April period could tilt a little drier.' La Niñas typically push the jet stream further north, resulting in less stormy weather. The region is in good shape for water supply, but water managers are keeping an eye on Lake Okeechobee, the primary dry season source for freshwater. The Army Corps will allow the lake to recede to help it recover from high wet season levels, said Maj. Cory Bell, district deputy commander for the Corps' Jacksonville District. 'As we move forward in the dry season, we're looking at lake recovery operations, and we will communicate that with our stakeholders,' he said. With a rainy season delivering about 120% of normal rainfall, water restrictions look unlikely, according to South Florida Water Management District officials.
