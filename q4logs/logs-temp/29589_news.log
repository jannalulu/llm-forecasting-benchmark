**US Reports New Human and Porcine Cases of H5N1 Avian Flu**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US have reported two new human cases and one porcine case of the H5N1 avian flu epidemic. The porcine case was detected in a small farm in Oregon and is the first case of its kind in the US. The farm has been quarantined and the animals have been slaughtered. According to experts, the fact that the case was detected in a small farm with non-commercial purposes reduces the risk of contagion and does not affect the food market. However, experts warn that the introduction of pigs into the equation could change the dynamics of the epidemic, as pigs have a respiratory system similar to humans and can be infected by both avian and human viruses. This could lead to the creation of new variants, potentially more contagious to humans. The epidemic has affected over 100 million birds, 440 farms, and at least 10,400 wild birds, and has had a significant impact on the meat and dairy industries. The H5N1 avian flu has caused at least 904 human infections and 464 deaths worldwide since 2022.

**Flu-Linked Hospitalization Rates Vary Across Seasons, Highest in Adults 65 Years and Older**
According to research published in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, influenza-associated hospitalization rates varied significantly across seasons, with the highest rates in adults 65 years and older. The hospitalization rates ranged from 8.7 to 102.9 per 100,000 population before the COVID-19 pandemic. The rate was 0.8 for 2020-2021, but returned to recent pre-pandemic levels in 2022-2023. The researchers found that adults 65 years and older consistently had the highest hospitalization rate, followed by children aged 0 to 4 years in most seasons. The prevalence of underlying medical conditions increased with age, ranging from 36.9% to 95.4% for children and adults 65 years and older, respectively. Antiviral use decreased from 90.2% in 2018-2019 to 79.1% in 2022-2023, especially among children and adolescents. As Angelle Naquin, MPH, from the CDC, notes, 'Each of these findings are of public health importance on their own but collectively highlight the importance of conducting robust and adaptable annual public health surveillance for influenza-associated hospitalizations.'

**Study shows varied impact of flu in US, with up to 29,000 hospital cases in a season**
A new study published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report shows the continued impact of influenza on the US healthcare system over the past 13 flu seasons. The study analyzed data from the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) database, which collected information on laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations among Americans of all ages from 2010-11 to 2022-23. The study found that the number of hospital cases ranged from a low of 2,415 cases during 2011-12 to a high of 29,695 during 2017-18. Adults 65 years and older had the highest flu-related hospitalization rate across all age-groups, followed by children ages 0 to 4 years. The study also found that the proportion of patients admitted to the intensive care unit ranged from 14.1% during 2021-22 to 22.3% during 2013-14, and the proportion of patients who died in the hospital ranged from 2.2% during 2021-22 to 3.5% during 2013-14. Furthermore, the study found a concerning trend of a decline in antiviral treatment of hospitalized patients with influenza, from 90% during the 2018-19 influenza season to 79% during the 2022-23 season. 'The decline in antiviral treatment of hospitalized patients with influenza from 90% during the 2018-19 influenza season to 79% during the 2022-23 season represents a concerning trend and highlights missed opportunities to prevent influenza-associated complications among those at increased risk for severe influenza complications,' the authors concluded.

**Influenza australiana: Experts Warn of 200,000 Cases per Week, Importance of Vaccination**
The first cases of influenza australiana have been identified in Piemonte and Lombardia, but Professor Massimo Andreoni, scientific director of the Società italiana malattie infettive e tropicali, warns that it is likely to be spreading in the Lazio region and in Rome as well. 'We expect 200,000 cases per week nationwide, but it's harder to predict the peak, which is usually at the end of December, but last year it was at the end of November,' Andreoni said. He also notes that the recent temperature fluctuations in Italy will help the virus spread. 'Temperatures affect it, and the temperature fluctuations are particularly insidious because it's easier to catch a cold. When it's cold, people tend to cover themselves, but when there are temperature fluctuations, people get caught off guard by the cold and it's more frequent to catch a cold.' Andreoni also emphasizes the importance of vaccination, citing the experience of Australia, where there were 15 million cases and a significant increase in hospitalizations. 'It's essential to vaccinate now, as it takes 15 days for the vaccine to take effect.'

**Whooping cough on the rise in NJ as flu season arrives. How bad will it be?**
Whooping cough cases are on the rise in New Jersey, with 423 confirmed cases as of October 12, more than double the 176 cases at the same time last year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention forecast that the 2024-25 season will be similar to last season or even lower in severity, with an 80% chance that peak hospitalizations will be the same or lower nationally. New Jersey health officials are reminding residents to get their flu and COVID vaccinations, which are effective during November and December holiday gatherings and still have enough strength to last into early spring. Dr. Kaitlan Baston, the state health commissioner, said, 'These vaccines are updated to give you the best protection from serious illness, hospitalization and death.' COVID hospitalizations have decreased in recent weeks, from 500 to 600 daily in August down to 250 to 300 in October, state data shows.

**Get Your Flu Vaccine Before End of October**
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends getting the influenza vaccine by the end of October to provide solid protection during the cold and flu season. The ideal time to get the flu vaccine is before flu activity starts, which typically peaks between December and February. The vaccine targets the three influenza strains most likely to circulate and cause illness in the United States, identified by watching flu trends in the southern hemisphere. The FDA emphasizes that the flu vaccine will not make you sick with the flu, but rather trigger your immune system to produce antibodies to protect against influenza disease. It can take about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body. The protection provided by an annual flu vaccine diminishes over time, and might be too low to prevent a person from catching the flu this season. The FDA notes that anyone can get sick with flu, but children, people age 65 and older, pregnant people, and those with certain chronic medical conditions are most at risk of developing serious complications. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that during the 2023-2024 U.S. flu season, there were 35 million to 65 million flu illnesses, 16 million to 30 million flu-related medical visits, 390,000 to 830,000 flu-related hospitalizations, and 25,000 to 72,000 flu-related deaths. The CDC also estimates that thanks to the flu vaccine, Americans avoided 6 million influenza-related illnesses, 2.9 million influenza-associated medical visits, 65,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations, and 3,700 influenza-associated deaths.

**The Right Time is Now to Get Your Flu Vaccine**
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends getting the influenza vaccine by the end of October to provide solid protection during the cold and flu season. 'Flu viruses typically spread in fall and winter, with activity peaking between December and February,' the agency said. The flu vaccine targets the three influenza strains most likely to circulate in the United States, identified by watching flu trends in the southern hemisphere. 'It can take about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body, which is an important reason to get your flu vaccine early, before flu activity starts,' the FDA added. The protection provided by an annual flu vaccine diminishes over time, and might be too low to prevent a person from catching the flu this season. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that during the 2023-2024 U.S. flu season, there were 140 million cases of the flu, 12,000 hospitalizations, and 6,000 deaths. The CDC also estimates that thanks to the flu vaccine, Americans avoided 3.5 million cases of the flu, 40,000 hospitalizations, and 2,000 deaths. 'Anyone can get sick with flu,' the FDA said. 'Typically, children and people age 65 and older are most at risk of developing serious complications from influenza.'

**Using math and machine learning, researchers predict early flu spike in Canada, U.S. | CBC News**
A team of Canadian and American researchers has used math and machine learning to predict an earlier spike in influenza cases this year. They analyzed data from 2015 to 2024 and found that there will be more than 1,600 new flu cases confirmed each day in U.S. laboratories by the end of November, nearly double the number of cases during the same time period last year. According to Hao Wang, director of the Interdisciplinary Lab for Mathematical Ecology and Epidemiology at the University of Alberta, the team predicts the initial surge of flu cases this year will come a month earlier than it did last year. Wang hopes this information will inform public health officials and make an impact on their decision-making. Junling Ma, a full professor at the University of Victoria, agrees that the model is suitable for capturing the key features of influenza and thinks it is likely to predict an earlier surge. Public health officials are preparing for an earlier flu surge by ensuring enough hospital beds are available and encouraging people to get flu shots sooner.

**The Flu Vaccine Might Be Less Effective This Year**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that the influenza vaccine being used this flu season may be less effective than last year's vaccine, based on data from five South American countries. The vaccine reduced hospitalization risk by 35% in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, compared to 51.9% effectiveness last year. The CDC notes that the vaccine's effectiveness 'might be similar in the Northern Hemisphere' if similar flu viruses circulate. This year's flu vaccines in the US will target the H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B (Victoria) strains, and health officials recommend that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccination. According to the CDC, an estimated 75 million people in the US got the flu between October 2023 and April 2024, resulting in 900,000 hospitalizations and between 17,000 and 100,000 deaths.

**COVID-19 Weekly Report: 35 Deaths and 672 New Hospital Admissions Recorded - ProtoThema English**
The latest COVID-19 report from the Health and Human Services (HHS) indicates a concerning rise in cases. During the week of September 23 to September 29, 2024, there were 35 deaths, 672 new hospital admissions, and 23 intubations due to the virus. The COVID-19 positivity rate has increased in all tested samples compared to the previous week. The recent rise in hospital admissions is noteworthy, with 672 new admissions reported, an increase from the weekly average of 593 over the past four weeks. The ECDC identified the KP.3 sub-variant of BA.2.86 as a strain of interest, but fortunately, these variants have not been associated with an increased risk of severe disease. Public health officials recommend that vulnerable populations adhere to preventative measures against respiratory infections and seek medical advice promptly if symptoms arise. Positivity rates for influenza remain very low, with no new severe influenza cases requiring ICU hospitalization or additional deaths from laboratory-confirmed influenza this week.

**Beat the flu to the punch**
James Shirley, a resident of Troy, has been taking the flu shot since 2003 and has only had the flu once. He encourages others to get vaccinated, saying, 'I would rather take the shot than take a chance on getting the flu.' The CDC estimates that between October 2023 and April 2024, as many as 75 million people in the United States got the flu, resulting in up to 900,000 hospitalizations and between 17,000 and 100,000 deaths. Shirley believes that getting a flu shot is the best way to stay well, saying, 'If there's a shot that will help me not be sick, I will take it.'

**Hospitals push flu shots ahead of virus season**
Hospitals and health systems are working to vaccinate community members and staff against influenza before the upcoming virus season. According to the CDC, the peak hospitalization burden for flu, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus is expected to be similar to or lower than last season. To boost immunization rates and reduce hospitalizations, health systems are rolling out diverse flu vaccination strategies, including free community flu shot clinics and vaccinating staff to maintain strong staffing levels. The CDC reported that flu vaccine coverage ranged from 37% among adults 18-49 to 73% among adults 65 and older during the last virus season. As stated by the CDC, the 2023-24 flu season was 'moderately severe,' with an estimated 34 million illnesses, 15 million healthcare visits, 380,000 hospitalizations, and 17,000 deaths. 'Flulapalooza' events, such as the one hosted by Vanderbilt University Medical Center, are also being held to promote flu vaccination and reduce the spread of illness.

This marks a fourth week of decline in new cases, with a decrease of 11% from the previous week. The weekly death toll remained above 1,200. The CDC estimates that COVID cases are currently declining or likely declining in 41 states, and stable or uncertain in 7 states. Nationally, COVID test positivity is 11.6%, down from 14.9% last week. Only 32.6% of hospitals in the U.S. submitted COVID data this week, revealing that at least 4,657 Americans are currently hospitalized with COVID. So far this year, more than 5.5 million COVID cases have been reported across the U.S., causing at least 375,971 hospitalizations and 43,923 deaths.

**Flu season returns: how to help prevent the illness**
The 2023-2024 flu season has seen 200 U.S. pediatric deaths, according to the CDC. Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News Medical Contributor, attributes the rise in pediatric flu-related hospitalizations and deaths to 'vaccine skepticism' following the COVID-19 pandemic. She recommends getting the annual flu shot 'sometime before Thanksgiving, mid-November' for most children, but emphasizes that it's best to get vaccinated as soon as possible. In addition to vaccination, medical experts suggest practicing preventive methods such as avoiding sick people, covering your mouth when coughing, washing your hands, and cleaning frequently touched surfaces.

**New Grim Milestone for Flu Pediatric Deaths Set**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported one new flu-related death in a child last week, bringing the total number of U.S. pediatric deaths for the 2023-2024 season to 200, surpassing the previous high of 199 deaths reported during the 2019-2020 season. According to the CDC, approximately 80% of children who were eligible for a flu vaccine and for whom vaccination status was known were not fully vaccinated. The CDC recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older, especially children at higher risk for serious flu complications. Flu vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk of flu-related medical visits by approximately two-thirds and halve the risk of flu-related hospitalization for vaccinated children.

**AstraZeneca's FluMist approval for self-administration could increase flu vaccine uptake**
The US FDA has approved AstraZeneca's FluMist for self-administration, increasing the accessibility of seasonal influenza vaccines. According to GlobalData, the influenza virus caused 2.1 million illnesses, 21,000 hospitalizations, and 4,700 deaths during the 2023-2024 US influenza season. Stephanie Kurdach, Infectious Disease Analyst at GlobalData, said, 'FluMist is approved for use in the US in children and adults ages 2 through 49 years. It is the only seasonal influenza vaccine to be delivered intranasally, which makes it a great option for those who may be needle-phobic.' The US CDC recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older receives a vaccination each influenza season. AstraZeneca plans to utilize a third-party online pharmacy to provide FluMist for self-administration, which is expected to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season. GlobalData's survey reveals that the percentage of patients vaccinated against seasonal influenza who were administered FluMist during the 2022-2023 season were 2.2% of children 2-4 years of age, 13.4% of children 5-17 years of age, and 3.4% of adults 18-49 years of age. Kurdach concludes, 'By increasing access to FluMist, there is potential for these percentages to increase. It is possible that we will see an increase in US patient shares of FluMist, given the convenient route of administration and ease of access, as well as an overall increase in seasonal influenza vaccine uptake.'

**As Concerns about Respiratory Diseases Among Public Drop to New Lows, US Health Officials Urge Vaccination**
New survey results from the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) show that few US adults intend to get vaccinated against flu, COVID-19, RSV, or pneumococcal disease this fall and winter, citing concerns about vaccine side effects and a general distrust of vaccines. Only 38% of US adults say they will definitely get a flu vaccine, and 26% say they will definitely get an updated COVID-19 vaccine. Health officials from NFID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasized that everyone age 6 months and older should get an annual flu vaccine and an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to help protect against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. According to new CDC data, the 2023-2024 flu season in the US was moderately severe with an estimated 41 million illnesses, 490,000 hospitalizations, and 25,000 flu-related deaths. 'We can protect ourselves and those we care about by getting updated vaccines to reduce the risk of serious illness from flu and COVID-19,' said CDC Director Mandy K. Cohen, MD, MPH. 'Vaccines are not just a shield against illness—they are an important tool in our public health efforts.'

**COVID & Infections: Number of Hospitalizations Increases**
The number of patients with respiratory symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sore throat, and fever has increased weekly. According to the ÖGK, 9,999 cases of grippe-like infections, 35 cases of actual flu, and 1,361 cases of COVID-19 infections have been reported, totaling 11,395 cases. This represents a 46% increase from the previous week, while overall hospitalizations in Lower Austria have increased by 9%. The ÖGK advises high-risk patients to take precautions such as regular handwashing and wearing masks to prevent infections and further transmission. They also recommend that the entire population be vaccinated against influenza, and that high-risk patients be vaccinated against COVID-19. However, the actual number of COVID-19 cases may be higher, as the virus is no longer reportable since July 2023 and fewer tests are being conducted. According to Virologist Monika Redlberger-Fritz, 34% of analyzed samples are currently positive for COVID-19, while only 11% are positive for rhinoviruses, which cause common colds and flu. The rest are attributed to influenza and other viruses. Redlberger-Fritz expects hospitalization numbers to continue rising in the coming weeks as both coronaviruses and rhinoviruses continue to spread.

**Influenza 2024: Experts Warn of Severe Season Ahead**
The upcoming influenza season is expected to be severe, with 150 million cases per week predicted. Experts warn that the sudden change in temperature has favored the spread of respiratory viruses, including influenza. 'Today we have many children who have never been in contact with the influenza virus, which can circulate more quickly. The problem is that if more people become infected, the number of deaths and severe cases could be high among the elderly and vulnerable,' says epidemiologist Gianni Rezza. To mitigate this, Rezza suggests increasing the vaccination rate against influenza. In Australia, the previous season was the second worst in the past 10 years due to the A/H3N2 variant. In Italy, 14.5 million cases of influenza-like illnesses were reported last year, and this year's numbers are expected to be similar or higher. The US FDA has approved the first self-administered flu vaccine, a nasal spray, for people aged 2-49. The vaccine is available online and can be administered at home after completing a questionnaire to assess suitability for self-administration.

**Influenza 2024: Bassetti Warns of 'Challenging' Season with 20 Million Expected Cases**
Matteo Bassetti, an infectious disease specialist at San Martino Hospital in Genoa, predicts that the 2024 influenza season will be 'challenging', possibly worse than the previous year. He notes that in Australia, where vaccination rates are high, the situation is 'even worse than 2023'. In Italy, where less than 1 in 5 people are vaccinated against the flu, Bassetti warns that the consequences of not vaccinating will be severe, including overcrowding in hospitals and emergency rooms. He estimates that 20 million Italians may contract the flu this year, compared to 15 million last year. Bassetti advises people to get vaccinated between late September and late October, as the first cases are likely to appear in mid-November. 'We are used to blaming the healthcare system, but in this case, the responsibility also lies with the citizens who refuse to get vaccinated, even though it is free and available in pharmacies or from their family doctor.'
