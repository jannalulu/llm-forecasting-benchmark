**Utqiagvik, the Northernmost City in the US, Enters Two Months of Darkness**
The city of Utqiagvik, located in the northernmost part of the United States in Alaska, has just entered more than two months of darkness. Known as the most northern location in the US territory, the municipality last saw the sun in the past week and will not see it again until the end of January. The sun set for the last time on November 18 at 13:27 local time and will return on January 22, 2025, at 13:15 in the south, but will disappear again just 48 minutes later. Until the sun's return, the sky can take on shades of blue or violet, like an eternal twilight, before plunging back into darkness. The city, previously known as Barrow, has a population of around 5,000 people and is located in the North Slope region, near the Arctic Ocean. At 71.17 degrees north latitude, more than 500 km north of the Arctic Circle, the city experiences a unique phenomenon. For about two months, the sun does not rise above the horizon, giving rise to a prolonged 'polar night.' The two months of darkness contribute to a sharp drop in temperatures: about a quarter of the days in Utqiagvik have negative temperatures. The darkness also favors the development of the polar stratospheric vortex, a cold air whirlwind over the North Pole that influences the climate. Due to the tilt of the Earth's axis, regions near the Arctic Circle can remain far from the sun for days, weeks, or even months. The duration of the phenomenon expands according to proximity to the poles. At the North and South Poles, there is only one sunrise and sunset per year: it rises at the spring equinox and sets at the autumn equinox. In the North Pole, this means daylight between March and September. The remaining months are completely dark. 'It's a unique experience,' said a resident, 'but it can be challenging for some people.'

**Douglas: Cold air but no snow for Thanksgiving**
Old Man Winter is warning of a cold snap for Thanksgiving, with temperatures expected to be 10 to 20 degrees below average from Wednesday into the first week of December. Despite the recent mild start to autumn, the winter solstice is approaching, and long nights are bringing subzero air from Siberia to Alaska and northern Canada. According to Old Man Winter, 'I'll be surprised if we have a polar vortex winter with week after week below zero.'

**A brutally cold air mass is coming. How chilly will it get in your region?**
A cold air mass from the Laptev Sea north of Russia is moving towards the eastern United States, bringing temperatures in the single digits or lower to more than two dozen states. The polar plunge is expected to last into mid-December, affecting areas from Minot, North Dakota to Miami, Florida. Temperatures in the teens could reach as far south as Alabama and Georgia, while northern Florida could reach the twenties. No state is forecast to be spared from sub-freezing temperatures. The cold air will be fueled by the record warm waters of the Great Lakes, leading to heavy lake effect snow in some areas. Winter Storm Watches have been issued for areas downwind of Lake Ontario and Erie. The cold spell is not a sign of a reversal in the long-term warming trend, but rather an unusual event in a warming world.

**Winter Weather to Take a U-Turn: Warmer Temperatures Followed by New Cold Wave**
After the first winter cold snap, temperatures will rise significantly by Sunday, with up to 17 degrees possible. However, the weather models are already indicating a new cold wave for early December. Diplom-Meteorologe Dominik Jung from wetter.net explains, 'For the end of November, these are clearly too high values, with an average of 10 degrees above the values that can be expected at this time of year.' The temperature will drop again after a warm Sunday and Monday, and a new cold wave is expected for the first days of December. The snowfall limit will drop to around 400 meters, and new frost and snowfall are possible in the first week of December. However, the long-term weather models predict a warmer December, with the CFS-Model of the US weather agency NOAA forecasting a December up to 2 degrees warmer than usual. This does not rule out the possibility of cold phases with snow, but a mild winter is likely.

**The Polar Night in Barrow, Alaska: A 60-Day Journey into Darkness**
The residents of Barrow, Alaska (also known as Utqiaġvik) will not see the sun for over 60 days, until January 22, 2025. This phenomenon occurs due to the Earth's tilt, which prevents the sun's rays from reaching a sufficient height above the horizon. According to National Geographic, the polar night occurs in Barrow, a community of around 4,900 inhabitants, located at the northernmost tip of Alaska, due to the Earth's axis tilt. This results in weeks and even months of total darkness in the Arctic and Antarctic Circles. The polar night also brings extremely cold temperatures, with an average temperature of around -20°C in January. Despite the harsh conditions, the residents of Barrow continue their daily lives, but spend more time indoors, wrapped in blankets. Interestingly, Barrow is not the only place where the polar night lasts for over a month, as it also occurs in Murmansk, a city in Russia with over 300,000 inhabitants, where the phenomenon lasts from early December to early January, around 40 days without sunlight. As said by the residents, 'Achis, achis... Sí, este suceso lo provoca la inclinación del eje de la Tierra, porque el Sol no alcanza una altura suficiente para enviar sus rayos por encima del horizonte en las regiones más cercanas a los polos, provocando semanas y hasta meses de total oscuridad.'

**Winter 2024: Countries to be Covered by Snow and Reach Freezing Temperatures**
The National Center for Atmospheric Prediction (CPC) expects a 60% chance of a phenomenon called 'nina' to occur in the United States from December 2024 to February 2025, which can cause significant temperature fluctuations and precipitation in the upper Mississippi River Valley. The CPC also predicts that the phenomenon of 'nina' will continue until March 2025, making it more likely for the world to experience colder temperatures than usual. The CPC notes that the shift from the 'nino' phenomenon to the 'nina' phenomenon will bring changes to the global climate, with some regions experiencing more variability than others. In the United States, 17 states have been issued winter weather warnings, with parts of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, and South Dakota expected to experience cold temperatures. Heavy snowfall is expected in the Oregon Cascades, with up to 2 feet of snow, and 15-18 inches of snow in the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming and the Colorado Mountains. Temperatures are expected to drop below freezing in areas affected by freeze warnings, with temperatures reaching as low as 21°F in parts of New Mexico and 22-23°F in parts of Colorado.

**Colder weather spreads south across Mainland Alaska**
A colder, quieter, and sunnier weather pattern is taking hold across Mainland Alaska. Temperatures are expected to drop significantly, with highs in Southcentral set to drop an additional five to ten degrees. The coldest weather for the state is expected through the middle of the week, with daily highs expected to continue to drop. By Wednesday, most of the region is expected to hover in the low to mid-20s for highs. While quiet weather will headline much of this week, there will be the potential for snow showers as the week draws to a close, with minor amounts of snow expected. The return to snow will mean a brief warming trend through the weekend, but much of this month will continue to trend on the colder side. The Interior will see a large portion of this week lead to highs in the single digits, while overnight lows will drop well below zero, with some areas potentially dropping as low as minus 20 over the coming mornings.

**Amid season’s first snowfall, Anchorage stands up city website for tracking plow progress**
Anchorage has launched a new website, muni.org/plow, to track the city's plow-out progress during the winter season. The website, unveiled on Tuesday, provides real-time information on which roads, sidewalks, and neighborhoods have been cleared or not yet handled. Mayor Suzanne LaFrance's administration aims to improve communication and preparedness for winter weather, a key campaign promise. The site is a work in progress, but it already offers features such as reporting blocked bus stops and requesting driveway berm removals for elderly and disabled residents. The city plans to add GPS devices and monitoring systems to its graders in December, allowing residents to track the fleet's deployment. This effort is a response to criticism of the previous administration's handling of winter weather, which led to delays in clearing residential streets after significant snowfalls.

**Temperatures falling — will the snow follow?**
Temperatures in Anchorage, Alaska are falling, but it's unclear if snow will follow. The average first date of measurable snow is October 16, but this year it might come earlier. A strong storm is brewing, set to hit over the weekend, bringing cooler temperatures and heavy rainfall.
