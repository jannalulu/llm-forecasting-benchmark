Min holds 50.5% of the vote, while Baugh has 49.5%. Min's campaign focused on access to abortions, violence involving guns, climate action, and environmental justice, while Baugh has promised to combat inflation, fight the fentanyl crisis, and lower gas taxes. Other close races include those in Districts 22, 21, 22, and 48, where candidates such as Ken Calvert, David Valadao, Robert Garcia, and Michelle Steel are vying for seats. The candidates have highlighted various issues, including supporting farmers and the military, preserving funding for Social Security and Medicare, and ensuring abortion access.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 03:59 AM\nSource:[www.theepochtimes.com](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/some-california-races-are-still-too-close-to-call-5758121)\n\n**2024 was yet another 'change' election: From the Politics Desk**\nThe 2024 election marked the sixth consecutive 'change' election in the US, with either the White House or at least one chamber of Congress switching party control. According to NBC News polling, a supermajority of voters have been dissatisfied with the nation's direction, with 73% of voters in the 2024 election saying they were angry or dissatisfied with the way things were going in the country. Donald Trump won those voters, who saw him as the change agent in the race. The Senate Republican leadership elections are now remerging as a MAGA proxy fight, with Sen. Rick Scott seeking to claim the mantle of the pro-Trump wing. Scott has promised to push 'the Trump agenda' if elected, but it's far from clear that he will succeed, given the Senate's insular nature and the anonymous nature of the vote. Trump has made one public demand: The next GOP leader should support his ability to make 'recess appointments' to temporarily install personnel without Senate confirmations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 10:20 PM\nSource:[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/2024-change-election-trump-republicans-politics-desk-rcna179627)\n\n**When will we know who wins Colorado’s 8th Congressional District seat?**\nThe election for Colorado's 8th Congressional District seat is still too close to call, with Republican Gabe Evans leading Democratic Congresswoman Yadira Caraveo by 0.6%. According to Philip Chen, assistant professor of political science at Denver University, 'It was a close race last time and it was a close race this time.' Chen notes that the closeness of the race highlights the importance of secure ballot counting environments and the potential impact of weather on the process. He also points out that slow elections are more common than people think, and that recounts are usually unnecessary. Chen estimates that it could be by the middle of next week, on Wednesday or Thursday, before we officially know who has won the 8th Congressional District seat. 'We trigger recounts mostly because we want to make sure that the vote count is correct,' Chen said. 'Not saying it's impossible but unlikely that it would change the results.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2024 03:43 PM\nSource:[kdvr.com](https://kdvr.com/news/politics/colorado-politics-news/when-will-we-know-who-wins-colorados-8th-congressional-district-seat/)\n\n**Here Are the Uncalled House Races That Will Determine Control of the Chamber**\nSeveral key House races remain uncalled, with 20 seats in 10 states still to be decided. As of Saturday evening, Republicans lead Democrats by 213 seats to 202. If the current margins hold, Republicans could gain 11 more seats, for a total of 224, while Democrats could add 9 seats, for a total of 211. Incumbent Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa) is leading by fewer than 1,000 votes in Iowa's 1st congressional district, while Democrat Cleo Fields is currently leading in Louisiana's 6th congressional district. In California, many districts have a significant number of ballots left to be counted, with incumbent Rep. Josh Harder (D-Calif.) leading in the 9th district and incumbent Rep. David Valadao (R-Calif.) leading in the 22nd district. In Oregon's 5th district, incumbent Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Ore.) is behind her Democratic challenger Janelle Bynum by 2.5 percent. In Washington's 4th district, both incumbent Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) and Republican Jerrod Sessler advanced from the top-two primary, with Newhouse leading by 4.6 percent.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2024 06:12 AM\nSource:[ntd.com](https://www.ntd.com/here-are-the-uncalled-house-races-that-will-determine-control-of-the-chamber_1027829.html)\n\n**Democrats and Republicans Battle for Control of US House of Representatives in Latinx Communities**\nThe control of the US House of Representatives is up for grabs in the upcoming elections, with Democrats and Republicans vying for power. The Democrats have invested millions of dollars in states they already control, but the Republicans are fighting to hold onto their strongholds in Latinx communities. The outcome of the elections will be decided by a handful of competitive districts, including several in California and New York. Democrats have been working hard to connect with Latinx voters, holding events such as 'Boletas y Belleza' (Beauty and Ballots) in California's Central Valley, where they are focusing on issues such as healthcare and immigration. 'We have strong candidates running to retake seats in districts with high Latinx populations in California and New York,' said José Alonso Muñoz, secretary of Hispanic media for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). 'We've been working hard to connect with Latinx voters, talking to them about the issues that matter to their families and talking to them about the work that Democrats have done to reduce costs, expand healthcare, and protect fundamental freedoms.' The DCCC has invested $27 million in additional ads focused on taking seats away from Republicans, including $1.5 million for Spanish-language TV ads, mostly in districts 13 and 22. In the 22nd district, Democratic candidate Rudy Salas is running against Republican incumbent David Valadao in a rematch of the 2022 election. 'There's no doubt that control of the House of Representatives hinges on the Central Valley,' said Salas. 'If we win here, we can take back the House and offer real results for working families in the Valley and across the country.' Salas has been focusing on issues such as healthcare and immigration, and has been endorsed by the Democratic Party. 'Latinos are an essential part of my campaign,' said Salas. 'This is the most Latino district in California, and it's the home of César Chávez, Dolores Huerta, and the farmworkers' movement. However, this region has never had a Latino representative in Congress.' Salas added that as a congressman, he would work to reduce the cost of healthcare and medications, fight for a path to citizenship for residents who have been working hard and following the rules, and protect Dreamers and DACA students. 'We know that if we can take back the House, we can protect Social Security, protect Medicare, protect reproductive freedom,' said Democratic candidate George Whitesides, who is running against Republican incumbent Mike Garcia in the 27th district. 'We can continue to reduce the cost of healthcare and medications for people. And we know that none of those things will be possible with the current Republican majority in Congress.' Whitesides has been focusing on issues such as healthcare and immigration, and has been endorsed by the Democratic Party. 'Latinos are a big part of our district and we've always centered the Latinx community in our campaign because we knew they were going to be a big part of the future,' said Whitesides. 'We've always centered the Latinx community in our communications. We have promoters who go door-to-door. They go out in a bilingual team to talk to people in Spanish or English, depending on who they meet in the community. We make an effort to reach people where they are.' Whitesides mentioned that his opponent Mike Garcia, who is the son of Mexican immigrants, has allied himself with Trump and supports his promise to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. Noticias Telemundo contacted Garcia's campaign for an interview but did not respond until the time of publication. 'These elections, for me, are the most important of my life, because they will determine the future that we will have as Latinos,' said Xiomara Flores, a 66-year-old social worker who volunteered for Whitesides' campaign. Flores said that she knows the parents of Whitesides' wife, Hidalgo, and that 'working with the campaign feels like being part of a family. Talking about my candidate is so easy, because I see the work he does for Latinos.' Flores, the daughter of Nicaraguan migrants, said that since the 2016 elections, when Clinton and Trump faced off for the presidency, she has felt 'hostility' and intimidation for being Latina, even from people she knew. They questioned her immigration status. She lost friends. That made her self-censor, not talk about politics, not express her public support for Democrats. But that changed this election. 'When I found out we were going to enter a campaign that was going to be so dangerous, because of what we saw on January 6, I said, 'No, I also have the right to publish, talk about the party and the candidate, especially the party that I love, the party that has represented civil rights, which are so important and that people died to obtain these civil rights,' said Flores, excited. 'It's not perfect. And I remind you that you have to unite more and we have to be part of that party, which I've seen since June, but today I'm walking with my Whitesides t-shirt and I no longer have that fear. Why? I know I have confidence, I have the right to support not only my candidate George Whitesides, but also Vice President Kamala Harris.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 11:55 PM\nSource:[Telemundo](https://www.telemundo.com/noticias/noticias-telemundo/elecciones-estados-unidos-2024/distritos-latinos-clave-balance-poder-congreso-california-nueva-york-rcna177682)\n\n**Rudy Salas: A Key Candidate for Democrats to Regain Control of the US House of Representatives**\nRudy Salas, a 47-year-old Democrat, is a key candidate for the Democratic Party to regain control of the US House of Representatives. He is running for the 22nd Congressional District in California, a predominantly Hispanic and agricultural area where Democrats have gained a registration advantage over Republicans in recent years. Salas, who hopes to make history as the first Hispanic elected to Congress from this district, said he wants to give his community a leader who will fight for their real needs. 'The residents of this area have many concerns that can be addressed from Congress, and I will work from there to improve their situation,' he said. Salas is running against Republican Congressman David Valadao, who won the election in 2022 by just 4,000 votes. The district has a 60% Latino eligible voter population, and Salas has been working to educate voters on why this election is important to them and their families. He has been door-to-door, making over 1 million calls, and holding dozens of community forums. Salas' campaign has focused on the major concerns of the district's residents, including healthcare, education, access to clean water, the economy, affordable housing, and immigration. He supports a pathway to citizenship for long-term undocumented immigrants and opposes mass deportations and the expansion of migrant detention centers. Salas has also criticized Valadao's votes against laws to reduce medication costs, the Affordable Care Act, and the Infrastructure Act, among others. The Democratic Party needs to flip at least four seats in the House to regain control, making Salas' campaign highly relevant.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 26, 2024 04:52 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!](https://es-us.noticias.yahoo.com/rudy-salas-ficha-clave-recuperar-165258882.html)\n\n**House Republican from California aims to defy district's blue lean - Washington Examiner**\nRep. David Valadao (R-CA) is a rare California Republican who has distanced himself from former President Donald Trump and still managed to win re-election. Valadao's district, the 22nd Congressional District, is a Republican outpost in a heavily Democratic state. His opponent, former Democratic state Assemblyman Rudy Salas, has a clear edge with registered voters, with 42% of the district's voters registered as Democrats. However, voters in this district have a history of splitting their tickets, and Valadao has held steady in his opposition to Trump. Salas has criticized Valadao for his vote against capping insulin at $15 and his approach to healthcare, but Valadao's campaign is confident that voters will look back on his record and continue to support him. 'I have to focus on winning my race, and that's my top priority,' Valadao said at a recent debate with Salas. 'And I've purposely gone out of my way to make sure I'm not getting involved in anything presidential.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 08:37 AM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/premium/3200431/house-republican-california-aims-defy-blue-lean/)\n\n**The stakes for the House are enormous as a purple district in California votes**\nThe 22nd congressional district in California is a key battleground in the upcoming House elections. Republican incumbent David Valadao and Democratic challenger Rudy Salas are facing off in a rematch of their 2022 contest. Despite the district's purple lean, voter turnout has been low, with only 3rd fewest ballots cast nationwide in 2022. Democratic canvassers are hoping to change this by getting more people to vote, but Valadao's moderate stance on issues like immigration may make it difficult for Democrats to win. As one voter, Sharon Nichol, said, 'I am a Republican, but when it comes to serving Kern County specifically, I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican. I want somebody who's going to do work in my city and get some results.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 04:47 PM\nSource:[ksmu.org](https://www.ksmu.org/2024-10-24/the-stakes-for-the-house-are-enormous-as-a-purple-district-in-california-votes)\n\n**2024 US Elections: A Historic Shift in the US Congress?**\nThe 2024 US elections could lead to a historic shift in the US Congress, with the House of Representatives potentially falling under Democratic control, while the Senate would be controlled by Republicans. This scenario has never been seen in the 230-year history of the US Congress. The electoral maps for the House of Representatives and the Senate are very different, which explains this possible inversion. Democrats need only four more seats to regain the majority in the House. Democrats have a higher chance of winning in the House. In New York, four Republican-held seats in 2022 could flip to Democrats. A recent Newsday/Siena College poll shows that Democratic candidate Laura Gillen is leading Republican candidate Anthony D'Esposito in the 4th district by 12 points. Other polls indicate that Democrats could also win in the 17th, 19th, and 22nd districts, where the races are very close. The fight for Senate control is much more difficult for Democrats. Republicans could win two key seats, including in West Virginia, where Joe Manchin is retiring, and in Montana, where Jon Tester is facing a tough battle. Other opportunities for Republicans are in Ohio, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The trend of voting in line with presidential elections is becoming more common. In 2020, only 4% of House districts voted differently for the presidential election and their representative in the House. This phenomenon makes predictions clearer: districts won by Biden are now top targets for Democrats. In California, five Republican-held seats could also be won by Democrats, strengthening the possibility of a Democratic majority in the House. A historic result is possible?\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 01:00 PM\nSource:[rtl.be](https://www.rtl.be/actu/monde/international/les-elections-de-2024-pourraient-bouleverser-le-congres-americain-une-premiere/2024-10-24/article/725685)\n\n**Map shows House seats most likely to flip in congressional elections**\nThe battle for control of the House of Representatives is heating up, with Democrats and Republicans neck and neck two weeks before the November 5 election. According to the Cook Political Report, there are 27 toss-up races, with 12 held by Democrats and 15 by Republicans. FiveThirtyEight's House forecast shows the race as a dead heat, with Democrats and Republicans winning their simulation 50 times each. Democrats could take back a slight majority by sweeping the competitive races in New York and California, two solidly Democratic states where Republicans outperformed expectations in 2022. In New York, there are five competitive races, including the 22nd Congressional District, where Republican Brandon Williams is facing a challenge from Democrat state Senator John Mannion. A poll conducted by GQR showed Mannion with a 7-point lead, 50 percent to 43 percent. In California, there are five toss-up seats currently held by Republicans and two seats classified as 'Lean Democrat.' Democrat Adam Gray is challenging Representative John Duarte in a Central Valley-based seat, a rematch of the race two years ago, in California's 13th District. Independent polls are showing tight races in some districts where Republicans are favored, including Virginia's 2nd District, where Republican Representative Jen Kiggans is leading Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal by one point, and New Jersey's 7th District, where Republican Representative Tom Kean is leading Democrat Sue Altman by two points.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 07:21 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/map-house-seats-most-likely-flip-congressional-elections-1973749)\n\n**CD22: Rudy Salas discusses key issues ahead of election**\nRudy Salas, a former Assemblyman and Bakersfield native, is running for the 22nd Congressional District seat against incumbent David Valadao.

He highlighted his legislative successes, including opposition to gas tax increases and securing funding for a Valley Fever Institute in Kern County. Salas also emphasized his commitment to addressing rising medical costs, improving immigration systems, and cracking down on criminal consequences.

The Republicans currently control the House with a slim majority of eight seats, thanks in part to the 2022 elections, where some California seats changed from blue to red. In the Central Valley, Orange County, and East Los Angeles, the most competitive districts are located. Among the 10 most competitive districts, the Republicans hold seven seats. In the 13th district, Representative John Duarte (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Adam Gray in a rematch of the 2022 election. Duarte won the district for the first time since 1974, with a margin of less than 600 votes. In the 22nd district, Representative David Valadao (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Rudy Salas in the San Joaquin Valley, a region known for its agricultural production. In the 27th district, Representative Mike García (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat George Whitesides, a former NASA administrator. In the 45th district, Representative Michelle Steel (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Derek Tran, a veteran, entrepreneur, and consumer rights lawyer. In the 47th district, the news is still developing. The candidates are vying for the support of voters in the north of Los Angeles County, including the cities of Lancaster, Palmdale, and Santa Clarita, as well as parts of Los Angeles. Steel, a Korean immigrant, has been a strong advocate for reducing taxes and spending, while Tran has emphasized the need to protect the rights of consumers and workers. 'I am in touch with the problems of the district and have a lot of credibility with a lot of people,' Duarte said. 'The message is clear: bring water to farms, drill American oil, and control the cost of living.' 'I am running for Congress because politicians have created more problems than they have solved,' Whitesides said. 'I will use my business experience to solve problems, not play politics.' 'My parents were refugees who worked hard and sacrificed so that I could achieve the American dream,' Tran said. 'I enlisted in the Army to repay the country for what it has given me, and I am running for Congress to put people ahead of politics, protect our democracy, and ensure that everyone, regardless of where they come from, has the opportunity to succeed without fear of having their freedoms taken away.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 02:28 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN ÉPOCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/votos-de-california-pueden-hacer-que-gop-conserve-la-camara-1314564.html)\n\n**Our View: Vote for Valadao for 22nd Congress; Bains for 35th Assembly**\nIn the 22nd Congressional District, voters have a choice between two good candidates: incumbent Republican Rep. David Valadao and former Democratic Assemblyman Rudy Salas. Both men share qualities of independence and a commitment to moderate policies. Valadao has been a consistent winner in the district, despite its large Democratic voter registration and Latino population. He has been open to reasonable immigration reform and has been a vocal critic of former President Trump's agenda. Salas has also bucked his party, voting against raising the state gas tax in 2017. The two men have differing views on climate change policies and the Affordable Care Act. Valadao has been criticized for voting to support Trump's efforts to terminate the Affordable Care Act, while Salas has slammed Valadao for backing climate change policies that have raised costs on California consumers. Despite their differences, both men have demonstrated their willingness to reach across the aisle to address needs. The Californian recommends reelecting Valadao to another two-year congressional term. In the 35th Assembly District, incumbent Democrat Assemblywoman Dr. Jasmeet Bains should be reelected to another two-year term. Bains has focused her reelection campaign on improving affordability in her district, including constituents' ability to put food on the table, pay for their children's education and buy gasoline. She has bucked her party leaders and has been a productive, independent representative for Kern County. The Californian recommends reelecting Bains.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 13, 2024 01:07 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/view-vote-valadao-22nd-congress-010100660.html)\n\n**In an ultra-competitive California House race, Democrats try to claim their place**\nIn California's 22nd Congressional district, Democratic challenger Rudy Salas is running against Republican incumbent David Valadao for a second time. Despite the district's history of voting Democratic, Valadao has represented the region in Congress for most of the past decade. Democratic canvassers like Noe Garcia are hoping to change this by getting more people to vote, citing the influence of Kamala Harris on voter engagement. However, Valadao's moderate stance on issues like abortion and immigration reform may make it difficult for Democrats to win. Salas has also broken from his party in meaningful ways, such as opposing a gas tax in 2017. Despite differences with their parties, both candidates have managed to build healthy funding for their campaigns.

Democrats dominate the state, but Republicans retain pockets of strength. The most competitive contests are concentrated in Republican-held districts that were carried by Joe Biden in 2020. Democrats are warning about former President Donald Trump's possible return to Washington, threats to abortion rights, and gun violence, while Republicans fault Democrats on crime, a porous southern border, high taxes, and inflation. Rep. Pete Aguilar has predicted the decisive fight for the chamber 'will run through California.' Several key races are highlighted, including Rep. Mike Garcia's bid for re-election in a heavily Democratic district, Rep. Ken Calvert's fight to hold off Democrat Will Rollins, and the Central Valley's 22nd District, where GOP Rep.

What experts expect in 2024**\nThe 2024 congressional races in California's Central Valley could be decided by turnout, particularly among young and Latino voters. Experts expect higher turnout due to the competitiveness and presidential election. However, changing demographics and party affiliations may affect the outcome. College-educated voters are moving to Democrats, while non-college-educated voters are shifting to Republicans. Latinos are also showing a rightward shift. The 13th and 22nd Congressional Districts have high populations of non-college-educated voters and a growing no-party-preference bloc. To win, campaigns need to actively reach out to key issues and earn the votes of Latino voters, who lack trust in either party. 'It's really about the composition of the population in these districts that's driving the change,' said Eric McGhee, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. 'Their votes need to be earned,' added Pablo Rodriguez, founding Executive Director of Communities for a New California Education Fund.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 05:31 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/turnout-key-central-valley-tossup-172144000.html)\n\n**David Valadao vs. Rudy Salas in California Congress tossup: Candidates answer key questions**\nThe 2024 election for California's 22nd Congressional District is a tossup between Rep. David Valadao (R-Hanford) and former Assemblyman Rudy Salas (D-Bakersfield). According to nonpartisan analysts, the district, which has more registered Democrats than Republicans, could go either way in November. Valadao has been in the House since 2013, while Salas has been in the California State Assembly for a decade. The district is one of several that Democrats are hoping to flip to gain the House majority in 2025. Both candidates were asked to fill out a survey, and their responses were checked and slightly edited for spelling and grammar. According to Valadao, he will urge pro-growth policies to ease the tax burden on middle-class families, increase domestic energy production, and make it easier to build new housing. Salas, on the other hand, will fight to deliver an expanded child tax credit, champion a first-time home buyer tax credit, and work to make lifesaving medicines more affordable. Both candidates also discussed immigration and border policy, with Valadao supporting the construction of physical barriers and reforming the asylum process, and Salas advocating for a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers and increasing the number of immigration judges.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2024 12:00 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/david-valadao-vs-rudy-salas-115500867.html)\n\n**Democrats’ Path for Control of House Runs Through Districts Like California’s 22nd in the Central Valley**\nThe 22nd Congressional District in California is a key battleground in the fight for control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Democratic former state lawmaker Rudy Salas is challenging Republican U.S. Representative David Valadao, who has held the seat since 2013. Salas has criticized President Joe Biden for not doing enough to lower monthly costs for voters, while Valadao has broken with former President Trump on issues such as tariffs and mass deportations. The district is the most racially diverse competitive House district in the country, and voters are sympathetic to the immigrant situation. 'People are a lot more sympathetic to the immigrant situation because so many of us here are immigrants,' said Valadao. The presidential campaigns have largely ignored California, resulting in less 'ad clutter' and more opportunities for congressional campaigns to break through. However, Salas' campaign is being outspent by Republicans, and labor activist Dolores Huerta is campaigning and organizing canvassers for Salas to ensure that Democrats do not underestimate the importance of the California races.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 05, 2024 08:50 PM\nSource:[einnews.com](https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2024/10/05/democrats-path-for-control-of-house-runs-through-districts-like-californias-22nd-in-the-central-valley/)\n\n**California House candidates spar on prices. What it means for tossup election**\nThe economy is the top issue for voters in California's 22nd Congressional District, with costs and income being major concerns. Rep. David Valadao and former Assemblyman Rudy Salas debated on how to address these issues, with Valadao blaming state regulations for higher costs and Salas arguing that Congress can do more to alleviate high prices. Experts say that Congress and state legislatures can impact costs through taxation changes, government spending, and policies such as increasing the housing supply. However, they also note that the legislative bodies have limited power to control prices, which are ultimately determined by market forces and external factors. Salas was criticized for voting against raising the gas tax in 2017, but his spokesperson argued that he voted on legislation to affirm or introduce taxes and fees, and that GOP Assemblymembers also supported some of these bills. Valadao was also criticized for voting against capping insulin prices at $35 a month in 2022, but he argued that it was an arbitrary cap that would lead to pharmacies and companies buying prescription drugs from other countries where the medicine is cheaper and potentially worse.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 04, 2024 10:13 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/california-house-candidates-spar-prices-220624248.html)\n\n**David Valadao, Rudy Salas clash on costs in debate for tossup California House race**\nIn a debate for the hotly contested 2024 California House race, Rep. David Valadao and former Assemblyman Rudy Salas clashed over their records on reducing costs in the San Joaquin Valley. Valadao tied Salas to the Democratic supermajority in the state legislature, while Salas countered by bringing up legislation Valadao voted against in Congress. The debate also touched on issues such as high-speed rail, immigration, homelessness, water, and abortion. When asked about their views on Israel and Gaza, Valadao said it's not his place to set a red line, while Salas said Israel needs to defend itself and be given the tools to do so. Neither candidate mentioned the names 'Donald Trump' or 'Kamala Harris' during the debate. The November rematch between Valadao and Salas in California's 22nd Congressional District is a tossup, with Democrats needing to flip just four seats to take a majority in the House of Representatives in 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2024 12:04 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/david-valadao-rudy-salas-clash-120000495.html)\n\n**WATCH: 22nd Congressional District Debate with David Valadao and Rudy Salas**\nThe two candidates for California's 22nd Congressional District, incumbent Rep.

The district is considered a 'purple district', where either party can win. Despite being a largely Democrat and majority Latino district, Valadao has been re-elected multiple times since 2013. Experts say voter turnout will be crucial in determining the outcome of the election. 'It's a truly purple district,' said Democratic political analyst Neel Sannappa. 'How much can really change just based off this one district, that could be the difference between who has the majority in the House.' The candidates have different priorities, with Valadao focusing on water, crime, homelessness, and drugs, and Salas focusing on cost, healthcare, and choice. 'The community has been fantastic. People have been great. We just need them to turn out in November,' said Salas. The election is considered one of the most expensive races nationwide, with millions being spent by the campaigns and outside groups to sway voters.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 12:58 AM\nSource:[KGET 17](https://www.kget.com/news/politics/your-local-elections/breaking-down-the-cd-22-race-and-its-candidates-ahead-of-high-stakes-wednesday-debate)\n\n**New poll shows Valadao-Salas race will, once again, be a difficult-to-predict toss-up**\nA new Emerson College/Nexstar poll shows that the race for California's 22nd Congressional District between Republican incumbent David Valadao and Democrat Rudy Salas will be a difficult-to-predict toss-up. The poll of 350 'very likely' voters shows that 45% would vote for Valadao, 45.4% for Salas, and 10% are undecided. Despite the district leaning Democratic and Latino, a Republican has repeatedly held office, and Valadao is behind Salas by only 0.4 percentage points. The poll also reveals that male voters lean toward Valadao, while women lean toward Salas, and that immigration and the economy are top issues for CA-22 voters. 'This is not the rest of America ... All politics is local,' said Frontier High School history teacher James Maddox. 'Those problems with [Democratic] turnout are the only reasons it's really competitive at all,' Maddox added. 'Anytime that Trump's on the ballot, you get a pretty big turnout,' Maddox stated, noting that Valadao has won every time Donald Trump was simultaneously on the ballot.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2024 02:48 AM\nSource:[CBS47 Fresno](https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/local-news/new-poll-shows-valadao-salas-race-will-once-again-be-a-difficult-to-predict-toss-up)\n\n**David Valadao and Rudy Salas to debate for your vote: How to watch it**\nThe highly contested U.S. House of Representatives seat in California's 22nd Congressional District will be debated by candidates David Valadao and Rudy Salas on October 2.

The polls, conducted in California's 13th and 22nd Congressional Districts, show that turnout will be key to who wins in November. In the 22nd district, former Assemblyman Rudy Salas, D-Bakersfield, led Rep. David Valadao, R-Hanford, by 4.2 percentage points. In the 13th district, former Assemblyman Adam Gray, D-Merced, led freshman Rep. John Duarte, R-Modesto, by 2 percentage points. The polls also showed that new voters in these districts tend to favor the Democratic challengers, while undecided voters slightly favor the GOP incumbents.

The GHI is an annual report by Welthungerhilfe and Concern Worldwide, in collaboration with Cesvi and Ifhv. The report highlights that wars and climate crises have caused a 26% increase in malnutrition over the past four years, affecting over 200 million people. If the current trend continues, 582 million people will still be chronically undernourished by 2030, with half of them in Africa. Cesvi emphasizes that 'while the Cop29 is taking place in Baku, the world will only reach a low level of hunger in 2160, more than 130 years from now.' In 2023, there were 399 natural disasters, causing 86,473 deaths and affecting 93.1 million people, resulting in $202.7 billion in economic losses. If no changes are made, 'grain, rice, and maize crops could further decline, particularly affecting rural communities, low-income families, and marginalized groups that are already vulnerable to climate change effects.' The regions most affected are Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. Cesvi is working to address nutritional needs in Somalia through 3 centers providing life-saving nutritional therapies. In Ethiopia, Cesvi supports the population through cash assistance, rehabilitation, and water collection basin restoration projects.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 04:46 PM\nSource:[ansa.it](https://www.ansa.it/ansa2030/notizie/lavoro_formazione/2024/11/11/cesvi-sos-fame-per-15-milioni-di-persone-in-piu-in-un-anno_3a75a94e-1117-4b3b-8c95-95165775fdb8.html)\n\n**Colombia's Agonizing Water Crisis: A Global Problem with Local Consequences**\nAccording to the United Nations, 2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to clean water, and by 2030, only 81% of the global population is expected to have access to clean water, while 67% will have access to sanitation services. The climate crisis is a major cause of this water crisis, driven by factors such as deforestation, overexploitation of water resources, and pollution. In Colombia, Bogotá is experiencing a severe water crisis due to low water levels in reservoirs, leading to rationing of the service. A 2022 study by the Ideam found that 207 municipalities in 16 departments were susceptible to water shortages during the dry season. The Colombian government has committed to strengthening its commitments to conserve and restore water ecosystems, as part of the 'Una sola agua' summit in Saudi Arabia in December.

Here’s how much more rain we need.**\nSouth Texas is still in extreme drought, despite receiving some meaningful rainfall since November. San Antonio has recorded 1.66 inches of rain this month, but is still 6.09 inches below average for the year. To end the year with average precipitation, San Antonio would need 9.42 inches of rain over the next seven weeks. However, this would likely cause more harm than good, resulting in flooding. Instead, half of that amount, between 4 and 6 inches of rain, would be beneficial in improving drought conditions. The weather forecast for the next week is dry and warm, with temperatures reaching the mid-80s. A cold front may move into the region by late Wednesday or early Thursday, but is expected to be weak and only cool temperatures by a few degrees.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 09, 2024 05:58 PM\nSource:[expressnews.com](https://www.expressnews.com/san-antonio-weather/forecast/article/drought-extreme-south-texas-rainfall-19900829.php)\n\n**US Faces Unprecedented Drought Crisis: Agriculture Land Affected in 48 States**\nThe United States is facing an unprecedented drought crisis, with nearly every state experiencing drought conditions, except Alaska and Kentucky. According to the US Drought Information Portal, over 45% of the country and Puerto Rico are affected, impacting over 150 million people and 318 million acres of crops. Key crops such as corn, sunflower, and durum wheat are severely affected, with 71%, 84%, and 67% of their production areas impacted, respectively. The drought is primarily driven by human-induced greenhouse gas emissions and a global water cycle imbalance. Cities like NYC are facing their worst drought since 1826, with 8.25 million people on drought watch. The US relies on imports to supplement its domestic supply, with key import sources including Mexico, South America, and Canada. The country maintains an agricultural trade surplus, but the gap has narrowed since 2016 due to lower production and faster growth in imports compared to exports.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 09, 2024 04:15 AM\nSource:[chemanalyst.com](https://www.chemanalyst.com/NewsAndDeals/NewsDetails/us-faces-unprecedented-drought-crisis-agriculture-land-affected-in-48-states-31311)\n\n**October was one of the driest months in history**\nOctober was one of the driest months in American history, with cities such as New York, Houston, Dallas, Philadelphia, and San Francisco not receiving measurable precipitation for 31 days.

Forecasters note that areas impacted by hurricanes have dried out rapidly, with some locations recording zero precipitation since the hurricanes. While some precipitation development is expected next week, it may not be enough to ease conditions. The dry season has also led to an increase in wildfires, with 21 large wildfires active nationally and over 883,000 acres burned.

According to the NOAA's annual winter forecast report, the La Niña phenomenon will influence the climate in the coming months, predicting a drier and warmer winter overall. While temperatures are expected to drop in December and February, the NOAA predicts that most of the state will experience temperatures above average. In southern Texas, there is a 60% probability of higher temperatures, while in the north and west, the probability is reduced to 40%. As for precipitation, it is estimated that most of Texas will have a 50-60% probability of below-average rainfall. The Farmer's Almanac also predicts a mild and dry winter for the state as a whole, although some areas may experience more humidity and cold, especially in the Panhandle region, where slightly colder temperatures are expected, especially at the beginning of 2025. Additionally, the first frosts are expected in Texas. The NOAA defines a frost as a drop in temperature to 0°C or less for a couple of hours. Although these phenomena are usually light in most of the state, residents should be aware. It is essential that residents prepare for the change in climate and stay informed about the weather conditions in the coming weeks.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 10:06 PM\nSource:[elmanana.com.mx](https://www.elmanana.com.mx/global/2024/10/30/frio-en-texas-estas-ciudades-viviran-las-primeras-heladas-de-la-temporada-135426.html)\n\n**Cold Fronts Expected in Texas This Winter**\nWinter is approaching in Texas on December 21, with some areas expected to be colder than others.

Currently, 3.6 million Somalis are facing crisis-level hunger, projected to increase to 4.4 million by December. The WFP said, 'To avert further deterioration of food security and nutrition outcomes across the country, sustained humanitarian assistance, including anticipatory action, is urgently needed.' The appeal follows findings from the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, which highlights that 1.6 million children under the age of five are at risk of acute malnutrition until July 2025. The WFP noted a 14 percent increase in global acute malnutrition and a 21 percent increase in severe acute malnutrition compared to the same season last year. The IPC report aligns with global forecasts indicating an 80 percent probability of La Nina conditions, which could lead to drought in Somalia. The WFP said, 'This is due to anticipated below-average rains, localized flooding in the riverine and urban areas of Hiran, Gedo, Middle Shabelle, and Lower Shabelle, ongoing conflict, high food prices, and diseases contributing to acute food insecurity and malnutrition.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 04:56 PM\nSource:[newkerala.com](https://www.newkerala.com/news/2024/68620.htm)\n\n**DRC: A Quarter of the Population Faces Severe Food Insecurity**\nAccording to the latest analysis of the Integrated Food Security Classification Framework (IPC) by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), approximately 25.6 million people in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which is about 22% of the analyzed population, will face severe food insecurity between July and December 2024.

The drought has led to severe food shortages, limited access to clean water, disease outbreaks, and loss of livestock. According to FEWS NET estimates, nearly 23 million people are facing high levels of food insecurity, with Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique being the most affected. It is estimated that between 14.0 and 14.9 million people will need urgent humanitarian assistance during the lean season from October to December 2024. The drought has also led to the displacement of thousands of people, disease outbreaks, and significant impacts on agriculture. The situation is further complicated by the ongoing cholera epidemic and the emerging risk of mpox, which may divert resources and response efforts away from the drought response in some affected countries. 'The situation has relatively stabilized', but water shortages are undermining hygiene and sanitation efforts, and the risk of cholera outbreaks remains in countries such as Malawi and Mozambique.

The blowout, which began nine days ago, is believed to be coming from an abandoned well that exploded. According to Sarah Stogner, an oil and gas attorney, this is at least the eighth time since last October that chemical water has spewed from a well in West Texas without clear ownership. The Railroad Commission of Texas has plugged 737 wells, but critics say the agency is not working fast enough. Residents are dealing with the consequences of decades of lax regulation and enforcement of cleaning up wells after they no longer produce oil or water. Experts say the blowouts like this one will persist as long as oil and gas production continues. The Permian Basin, where Toyah is located, produced 42% of U.S. oil in 2023.

The report states that an estimated 1.6 million children aged 6 to 59 months are projected to experience acute malnutrition between August 2024 and July 2025, with around 403,000 expected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition. The IPC also warns that the food security situation is expected to worsen in the projected period from October to December 2024, with 4.4 million individuals facing acute food insecurity, representing 23% of Somalia's total population. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has called for $1.6 billion to fund the 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan in Somalia, but only $507 million has been received as of August 2, leaving a significant gap in resources needed to address the growing crisis.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 08:40 AM\nSource:[UrduPoint.com](https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/low-rains-heighten-food-insecurity-for-millio-1865616.html)\n\n**US Homelessness May Exceed 653,000 by 2024, a New Record**\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the number of homeless people in the US may exceed 653,000 by the end of 2024, a new record. Currently, there are approximately 550,000 homeless individuals, which is about 10% more than the same period last year. This trend suggests that the US will surpass the record of 653,000 homeless people set in 2023. The growing housing prices and high rent have forced families to leave their homes, especially after the pandemic assistance ended. The influx of migrants, brought by buses from Texas to Chicago and Denver, as well as the marginalization of society through drug use, are also contributing factors. Additionally, the decline in the number of working men of working age in the US has led to difficulties in providing for themselves, loss of self-esteem, and mental health problems. The 'opioid epidemic' in the US has also made it difficult for many men to work. In December 2023, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development reported that the number of homeless people in the country exceeded 650,000 in 2022, breaking the historical record. The department attributed this to the increase in housing rent and the inability of the population to afford homes due to low wages.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 21, 2024 09:34 PM\nSource:[IzRus](https://iz.ru/1762934/2024-09-22/wsj-soobshchila-o-pochti-rekordnom-kolichestve-bezdomnykh-v-ssha-v-2024-godu)\n\n**Somalia Key Message Update: PAfter disrupted gu production season, below-average deyr rainfall is likely, August 2024**\nWidespread Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to persist through at least January 2025 in Somalia. Despite three consecutive seasons of average to above-average rainfall supporting gradual recovery among households badly impacted by the 2020-2022 drought, high food assistance needs persist due to ongoing conflict, severe flooding, high food prices, and limited income-earning opportunities. Humanitarian partners provided food assistance to an average of less than 1.3 million people monthly from June to August 2024, but this assistance covered only approximately 35-40 percent of FEWS NET's estimated population in need of food aid. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in settlements have minimal income-generating opportunities, limited access to food, and depleted coping capacity, with decreasing humanitarian assistance. All settlements hosting displaced populations are expected to face either Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes. The below-average deyr rainfall forecast for the upcoming October to December season is likely to contribute to a fourth consecutive season of below-average crop production, exacerbating food insecurity. Revised analysis indicates that the crop-dependent Sorghum High Potential and Bay Bakool Low Potential livelihood zones are expected to deteriorate to Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with most other agropastoral areas expected to continue facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. In northern and central pastoral areas, improved rangeland conditions, higher livestock birth rates, and increased milk production due to above-average gu rainfall are expected to improve food security for poor households through December. However, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to persist in the Addun and Coastal Deeh Pastoral livelihood zones of the central regions, which were badly impacted during the 2020-2022 drought.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 11:23 PM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-key-message-update-pafter-disrupted-gu-production-season-below-average-deyr-rainfall-likely-august-2024)\n\n**La Niña: Anticipatory Action and Response Plan, September–December 2024 - Mitigating the expected impacts of La Niña‑induced climate extremes on agriculture and food security**\nThe 2023-2024 El Niño event significantly impacted over 60 million people globally, causing devastating droughts, heatwaves, and floods. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) initiated anticipatory actions in 24 at-risk countries, followed by emergency response efforts in some of the hardest-hit areas. With the current El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) neutral state, La Niña is anticipated to develop between September and November, with probabilities ranging from 55 to 71 percent, and is expected to persist through January to March 2025. La Niña can increase the likelihood of extreme weather and climate hazards such as droughts, floods, excessive rainfall, and cyclones, which can have severe consequences on food security, particularly for the 282 million people already facing acute food insecurity worldwide. FAO's La Niña Anticipatory Action and Response Plan requires USD 318 million to deliver immediate support to the most at-risk and affected populations, reaching approximately 10.5 million people through the end of 2024. The Plan aims to protect vulnerable people from La Niña-induced disaster impacts, capitalize on the positive spillover effects of La Niña, and deliver early response where La Niña causes devastation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 01:40 PM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/la-nina-anticipatory-action-and-response-plan-september-december-2024-mitigating-expected-impacts-la-nina-induced-climate-extremes-agriculture-and-food-security)\n\n**How this September's drought levels compare to years prior**\nAccording to the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM), this year's drought levels in Central Texas are significantly reduced compared to years prior. The USDM map, released every Thursday, uses six categories to determine drought severity, including normal, abnormally dry, moderate, severe, extreme, and exceptional. Historically, exceptional drought (D4) has led to widespread crop loss, tree mortality, and water sanitation concerns. In contrast, this September has seen little to no severity in Travis County. Looking back at recent years, three out of the past five years have been mostly drought, with 2023 being the outlier. Last year, 38.71% of the Austin/San Antonio area was under an exceptional drought, making it the second hottest and driest year on record.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2024 03:20 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/september-drought-levels-compare-years-152017237.html)\n\n**70% of the Population Will Be Affected by Extreme Weather in the Next 20 Years**\nAccording to a new study, approximately 1.5 billion people will suffer from extreme temperatures, rain, and winds in the next 20 years. The study warns that climate change will lead to more intense and frequent extreme weather events. For example, the combination of drought and heatwaves is causing more frequent and intense forest fires worldwide. In 2022, a severe heatwave in Pakistan was followed by unprecedented flooding, affecting millions of people. Brazil is also experiencing the effects of climate change, with the Rio Grande do Sul experiencing historic floods in the first half of the year and the rest of the country facing its worst drought in decades. The researchers state that heatwaves can cause heat stress, excess mortality in humans and livestock, stress on ecosystems, reduced agricultural productivity, and disruptions to energy cooling and transportation. Similarly, extreme precipitation can lead to flooding, damage to settlements, infrastructure, crops, and ecosystems, increased erosion, and reduced water quality.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 16, 2024 04:51 PM\nSource:[Olhar Digital - O futuro passa primeiro aqui](https://olhardigital.com.br/2024/09/16/ciencia-e-espaco/clima-extremo-70-da-populacao-sera-impactada-nos-proximos-20-anos/)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

This comes after the release of Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Haiku in July. Amodei said that the company's plan is to 'shift' the capabilities of existing models, making them more powerful, before releasing an upgraded Opus. The delay in releasing Opus 3.5 is due to the need for excess computational power in pre-training, rigorous safety testing, and Anthropic's desire to build a new version of Opus that solves newer problems. Anthropic has been releasing new features, including a Computer Use feature and a Visual PDF tool, which may change the state of human-computer interaction.

This would not be the first time Amazon has supported Anthropic, as they signed a $4 billion initial agreement in 2022. However, this time Amazon has put a key condition: that Anthropic use Amazon's hardware processing developed by Amazon and hosted on its Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform to train its AI models. According to reports from early this year, Anthropic projects a spending of over $2.7 billion in 2024 just to scale its AI technologies. In this context, Amazon's financial boost could be an essential help for the startup, especially now that it is exploring a valuation of $40 billion and needs to secure funds as soon as possible. With this new injection of capital, Amazon seems not only willing to increase its investment but also to integrate Anthropic more deeply into its technological ecosystem, intensifying the competition in the world of artificial intelligence.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 07:06 PM\nSource:[ecommerce-news.es](https://ecommerce-news.es/amazon-se-plantea-aumentar-su-inversion-en-anthropic-con-una-condicion/)\n\n**Zetwerk is said to consider raising $1 billion in IPO**\nZetwerk Pvt Ltd., an Indian supply chain startup, is considering fundraising options, including an initial public offering (IPO) that could raise up to $1 billion.

The company's CEO, Roman Antonov, announced this on Friday. 'Our shareholder has given us a direction, and now we are working as a team to determine how we want to enter the public market, with what amount of financing.

Rolf had previously announced plans to expand its presence in Russian regions and conduct an IPO in 2025-26. However, the Central Bank raised the key interest rate to 21% on October 25, which has affected the company's plans. 'We plan to hold the IPO in 2025-2026.

The CMA stated that it has 'sufficient information' to begin a preliminary investigation into whether Alphabet's investment in Claude AI chatbot harms competition in the UK markets. The CMA divides its merger investigations into two stages: a preliminary review to determine if there is enough evidence for a deeper investigation, and a second stage where the government gathers as much evidence as possible. After the second stage, the CMA will ultimately decide on the regulatory outcome. The investigation will officially begin on Friday and by December 19, the CMA will decide whether to move to the second stage. Google spokesperson said, 'Google is committed to building more open and innovative AI systems in the world.' 'Anthropic is free to use multiple cloud services and we do not demand exclusive technical rights.' The CMA was approached for comment and will update this story if they respond. TechCrunch notes that Alphabet invested $300 million in Anthropic in early 2023, and later that year, it was said to be supporting the AI startup with an additional $2 billion. This can be classified as a 'near-complete merger', where deep-pocketed tech companies control emerging startups through strategic investments, hiring founders and technical employees. Amazon invested more in Anthropic: $4 billion. After the initial public comment period, the CMA refused to investigate this investment last month. The CMA stated that Amazon avoided Alphabet's fate at least partially due to its current rules: Anthropic's UK business did not exceed £70 million, and the two did not combine to form 25% or more of the region's supplies (in this case, Master's programs in AI and robotics).\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 26, 2024 11:48 PM\nSource:[alwafd.news/](https://www.alwafd.news/5473151)\n\n**OpenAI tipped to launch its next-gen AI model in December  --  but Sam Altman calls this 'fake news'**\nOpenAI is reportedly planning to release its next-generation GPT-5 AI model, codenamed Orion, in December.

Vasily Mutko, head of 'ДОМ.РФ', noted that the placement of shares may take place in the second half of 2025. Artem Fedorov, head of the subsidiary bank 'ДОМ.РФ', emphasized that for further growth, the company needs to consider going public and did not rule out the possibility of conducting an IPO next year. Alexei Moiseev, Deputy Minister of Finance, confirmed these plans, adding that the placement of shares will be a significant event for the Russian market. He noted the company's high financial performance and good dividends, but expressed regret about the need for partial sale. To successfully implement the IPO, several procedural issues need to be resolved, including the conversion of the company into a public joint-stock company and changes to the legislation that currently requires 100% state ownership of 'ДОМ.РФ'. The volume of the planned IPO has not been determined yet, and Moiseev noted that the desire to place a large package may face limitations on the Russian market. The decision on the size of the shares to be placed will depend on market capacity and demand. Moiseev also noted that the question of distributing the funds from the placement - whether to the budget or for the company's recapitalization - remains open. He confirmed that the task of conducting an IPO in the second half of 2025 is set for 'ДОМ.РФ'.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 18, 2024 06:08 PM\nSource:[finversia.ru](https://www.finversia.ru/news/markets/dom-rf-planiruet-vyiti-na-ipo-v-2025-godu-146194)\n\n**'VIS' Group Confirms Plans for 2025 IPO**\nThe 'VIS' group has confirmed plans to go public with an IPO in 2025.

However, the market situation is uncertain, and investors may prefer to put their money on a deposit with a low risk. But if the interest rate goes down, as the group hopes it will in the spring, they plan to enter the market in the fall, as explained by Romanashov, 'Unfortunately, the market situation is ambiguous.

According to Javier Cabrera, an analyst at Norbolsa, 'the current context invites companies to postpone their IPOs until 2025. The market has already discounted three rate cuts in the next four meetings of the European Central Bank.' Sara Hernández, director of analysis at Norbolsa, also notes that 'many investors have bet on fixed income this year, and it's unlikely that more companies will be able to complete their IPOs this year.' Puig, the first company to go public in 2024, suffered a setback in its first results as a listed company and reduced its profit by 27% in the first six months of the year due to the costs of its IPO. The company's shares have fallen by over 17% since its debut and currently trade at around 20 euros. Other companies, such as Cirsa, Tendam, and Astara, have also explored plans to go public, but it's unlikely that there will be new additions to the market before the end of the year.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 06:07 AM\nSource:[lacronicabadajoz.com](https://www.lacronicabadajoz.com/economia/2024/10/08/eurospastry-cox-desatascan-salidas-bolsa-109051039.html)\n\n**How the VC world is viewing AI**\nTorch Capital founder Jon Keidan believes OpenAI is shifting from a nonprofit to a for-profit structure to compete with other AI companies like Anthropic and xAI. Keidan says, 'As the competition has gotten more severe, OpenAI has shown a lot of success. They've developed product after product released successfully, and I think they're just trying to equalize the playing field.' He notes that OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman would have equity in the company if it becomes for-profit. Keidan is excited about AI's potential, saying, 'The capabilities and the adoption are through the roof, and it's going to absolutely be a moment much like in the 2010s when we saw mobile, social, cloud, and location converge.' However, he cautions that it's still early and difficult to determine the competitive advantages of AI companies. Keidan also notes that private AI companies are unlikely to announce initial public offerings (IPOs) anytime soon, as they have raised a lot of money and don't want to be distracted by an IPO.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2024 03:33 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/vc-world-viewing-ai-153348818.html)\n\n**NORTHEAST GROUP BERHAD**\nNortheast Group Berhad has announced the timetable for their Initial Public Offering (IPO).

The 'State of the Climate' document highlights that the decade of 2015-2024 is the warmest since records began. The global average temperature has exceeded previous values for 16 consecutive months, from June 2023 to September 2024. Between January and September 2024, the average air temperature was 1.54°C above the pre-industrial average, surpassing the critical threshold of the Paris Agreement. According to the report, the temporary increase is 'concerning' as it may put the Earth in a 'danger zone', but it is estimated that the long-term temperature rise will be around 1.3°C. The report also notes that 2023 saw a record level of greenhouse gas emissions, with a trend of increase expected in 2024. The content of heat in the oceans, responsible for absorbing about 90% of the global excess heat, has reached record levels. Additionally, the accelerated melting of glaciers contributes to the rise in sea level, which is now growing more than twice the rate observed between 1993 and 2002. The OMM emphasizes the urgency of taking action to mitigate climate change before the 1.5°C threshold is permanently exceeded. 'Each fraction of a degree of warming matters, as it intensifies extreme weather events and causes catastrophic losses,' the organization says. 'It is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve climate adaptation strategies.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 06:01 PM\nSource:[poder360.com.br](https://www.poder360.com.br/poder-sustentavel/2024-pode-ser-o-ano-mais-quente-diz-relatorio/)\n\n**A shadow ‘financial crisis’ has cost the world $2 trillion**\nA new report from the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) estimates that the total economic damage from climate-related extreme weather events globally was approximately $2 trillion between 2014 and 2023. This is roughly in line with the economic toll of the 2008 global financial crisis. The report, released ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, warns that the economic impact of climate change necessitates a swift and decisive response from governments. According to the report, approximately 1.6 billion people were affected by these weather events, and economic damages reached $451 billion in 2022 and 2023, a 19% increase compared to the annual average from the previous eight years. John W.H.

The report's findings come as world leaders argue over how much rich countries should pay to help poor countries adapt to a hotter world and deal with the damage done by increasingly violent weather. According to John Denton, secretary-general of the ICC, 'The data from the past decade shows definitively that climate change is not a future problem. Major productivity losses from extreme weather events are being felt in the here and now by the real economy.' Ilan Noy, a disaster economist, cautioned that the report's numbers may miss the impact of extreme weather on poor communities and vulnerable countries. 'The main caveat is that these numbers actually miss the impact where it truly matters, in poor communities and in vulnerable countries,' he said. The ICC urged world leaders to act faster to get money to countries that need help to cut their pollution and develop in ways that can withstand the shocks of violent weather.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 12:09 AM\nSource:[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/11/extreme-weather-cost-2tn-globally-over-past-decade-report-finds)\n\n**Vilfand: Probability of 2024 Being the Warmest Year on Record Increases**\nThe probability of 2024 becoming the warmest year on record is increasing, according to Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center. 'The probability of 2024 being the warmest year is increasing. This is due to the fact that the 2023-2024 El Niño event was very intense, which led to an increase in sea surface temperature in mid-latitudes. The temperature of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is record-high for the entire period of observation, and this has been ongoing for 15 months. This transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere is causing the global temperature to rise,' Vilfand explained. He noted that the main cause of warming is the increase in greenhouse gases, which prevent the long-wave radiation from the Earth's surface from being released. 'Currently, it is being delayed by this greenhouse gas, and its concentration is not decreasing, which is the main problem with warming,' he added. Vilfand also stated that, based on data from the World Meteorological Organization, 2024 is likely to be the first year when the average global temperature exceeds the pre-industrial period temperature norm by 1.5 degrees. 'This is a threshold value, it is marked in the Paris Agreement, we need to strive for the temperature increase not to exceed 1.5 degrees by the end of the century. Therefore, yes, this year is likely to be the warmest,' Vilfand explained.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 10, 2024 10:05 PM\nSource:[ТАСС](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22366287)\n\n**Atac: A New World from January 1, 2025, Says Rome's Mobility Assessor**\nRome's Mobility Assessor Eugenio Patanè said, 'From January 1, 2025, with the introduction of the new Service Contract, there will be a new world for Atac.' He presented the delibera on the in-house assignment of the tpl of Rome to Atac and the guidelines of the new Service Contract in the Capitolina Assembly. Patanè stated, 'The company came out of the preventive concordat in 2023 - an unexpected success because recovering 171 million euros in debts to creditors was a significant effort. Atac's response was fantastic, as for the first time in decades, we closed the balance in profit, 11 million euros. This means opening a new world also from an operational point of view. We said that three years were needed: 2022, '23, and '24, to put a normal situation back in order. We hadn't bought trams, we hadn't refurbished the trains, we hadn't refurbished the tracks. In 70 years, only one tram depot had been built, at Porta Maggiore, and when you have to rebuild it because the new trams are longer, you have to stop all the lines. That's the condition in which we had to work. That's why I said that 2024 would be the zero year: the metro A that closes at 21 for an investment, and not for a service disruption, the metro C that is in pre-operation until September 2025.' However, these works and construction sites will end in December 2024. From January 20, 2025, when all tram lines will reopen and from December 8, the metro A will reopen until 23:30, the substitute services will no longer be necessary - concluded Patanè. We will have in 2025 the year one of transportation, in which we will recover normality and be able to work for excellence. And this cannot mean going into a prorogation at the same terms and conditions, because it would mean assigning the company to a natural deficit.

These films were very popular and celebrated over two or three decades ago, telling a story of conquest and administration of justice based on personal criteria, due to the lack of institutions and legality. However, as time passed, these films fell out of favor and were replaced by other concepts of local and universal history. The conquest of the west is no longer seen as a solely civilizing gesture, but also as a component of despoilment and racism. In the old west, the law of the strongest prevailed, and when the law and order could not be imposed, armed outlaws would do as they pleased. This led to the emergence of films, series, and novels that told stories of heroes and villains, with a clear distinction between good and evil. In today's world, there is no international institution capable of imposing order among nations. International organizations are dominated by majorities that have already negotiated agreements, and solidarity is shown towards causes that are not in the common good. As a result, many countries and situations are left without support. The United Nations has not issued a binding decision in any recent conflict. Condemnations, resolutions, and declarations come and go, but international order is governed by anarchy. In this world, the authority of a powerful empire or country should impose itself. It's not ideal, nor is it the most just, but it's the most viable. The United States once played this role, but now seems to be renouncing it, leaving a power vacuum that is filled with more disorder. More countries and regimes have the resources to impose themselves locally, causing damage globally with little control over their actions and even less over their internal affairs. The international organizations are left with declarations that are largely ineffective and trying to control and minimize damage with little success. As we approach the US elections, it's unclear what role the first power will play in the world order or disorder. The thesis of not getting involved in conflicts that are not directly related to them is theoretically correct, but the lack of institutionalization and respect at the global level generates insecurity in many regions. The situation in Ukraine and the Middle East is not being resolved and is becoming more complicated by the day. Like in the old west, a few just actions seem to restore order, apply the law, and achieve justice. This pleases the audience, but it's not a solution, just a necessary and welcome band-aid.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 27, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[aurora-israel.co.il](https://aurora-israel.co.il/al-estilo-del-viejo-oeste/)\n\n**Here are Some Potentially Habitable World Targets for the Upcoming LIFE Mission**\nA recent paper outlines the criteria for prioritizing targets for the upcoming LIFE Mission, which aims to search for life in the universe.

The global temperature continues to rise, and the state of the sea ice is alarming. In 2023, the sea ice reached a historic minimum. While the Northern Hemisphere is cooling with the arrival of winter and the Arctic is refreezing, the sea ice is increasing at this time of year. However, this year's recovery seems laborious, to the point where a record for this time of year is being discussed. The relationship between water temperature and sea ice extent is clear: the warmer the water, the more ice melts. In 2023, records were broken in this regard, as the surface water had never been as warm. This situation has persisted until July 2024, with a slight decline observed since then. The Earth's climate system is complex, and the interaction between the atmosphere and water represents a positive feedback loop. The air is warming, and the oceans and vice versa. The global surface air temperature shattered records in 2023, and there is a good chance that 2024 will break the record, but 2023 remains slightly warmer at this date. According to NOAA estimates, a transition to a new La Nina episode seems to be taking place. It could be of short duration and low intensity.

The council will discuss main topics such as 'innovation for comprehensive growth, climate action and nature protection, energy transition, building trust for global cooperation, food and water security, and artificial intelligence'. Maroun Khoury, Director of the Middle East and North Africa at the World Economic Forum, said, 'Dubai, thanks to its strategy based on innovation and sustainable development, has provided an ideal environment to promote cooperation between governments, the private sector, and the academic community, and embodies its ambitious vision and efforts to provide effective solutions to problems like climate change and food security.' He added, 'The steps taken by Dubai and the United Arab Emirates in the field of artificial intelligence and digital transformation in recent years qualify it to be a global platform for dialogue and cooperation, where leaders of thought and decision-makers from around the world come together to exchange ideas and explore innovative strategies to face environmental crises and climate problems.' The report 'Closing the Climate Work Gap' launched by the World Economic Forum highlights how private sector climate action in the Middle East and North Africa can lead to a fundamental transformation in the region, by highlighting how the economy can benefit from private sector investments in renewable energy and green technology.

This collapse of terrestrial carbon sinks is a concern, as it means the world's land-based ecosystems are losing their ability to regulate the planet's temperature and mitigate climate change. Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, stated, 'Nature has so far balanced our abuse. This is coming to an end.' The collapse of terrestrial carbon sinks is provisional and may be due to excessive drought and wildfires caused by global heating. Without the planet's carbon sinks performing at a normal rate, reaching net zero will not be possible. Researchers say that carbon flow through the ocean and land is still a mystery, and climate models may be too optimistic due to missing factors such as drought-induced tree mortality. The planet's ability to absorb carbon weakening even moderately would make much steeper reductions in greenhouse gas emissions necessary to get to net zero.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 03:11 AM\nSource:[ecowatch.com](https://www.ecowatch.com/carbon-sinks-land-trees-net-absorption-2023.html)\n\n**World Future Council 2024 to be Held in Dubai with Participation of 500 Officials and Experts**\nThe World Future Council 2024 will be held in Dubai from October 15 to 17, 2024, with the participation of over 500 government officials, experts, and specialists from 80 countries.

The median estimate was 2.7 C by 2100, which could be a catastrophic outcome for humanity. However, not all authors think alike, with some believing that staying below 2 C is still likely, while others believe we are on track for even more horrendous levels of climate warming at above 3 C. The study also found that IPCC authors tend to overestimate the extent to which their peers share similar beliefs, a phenomenon known as the 'false-consensus effect.' This could be problematic if an author confidently believes that their expectations are widely shared by their peers. The study reaffirms the message that current efforts to tackle climate change are insufficient and more progress is needed quickly.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 03:00 AM\nSource:[nsnews.com](https://www.nsnews.com/highlights/opinion-new-survey-of-ipcc-authors-reveals-doubt-and-hope-that-world-will-achieve-climate-targets-9648288)\n\n**WTO Expects Gradual Recovery of Global Trade in 2024 and 2025**\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) expects a gradual recovery of global trade in 2024 and 2025, with a revised forecast of 2.7% growth in 2024, up from 2.6% in April. The organization has lowered its forecast for 2025 from 3.3% to 3.0%. WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala stated, 'We expect a gradual recovery of global trade in 2024, but we remain vigilant for possible disruptions, especially regional conflicts such as those in the Middle East.' The trade of goods worldwide fell 1.1% in 2023, hindered by high inflation and rising interest rates. The WTO's updated forecast for global trade in 2024 is slightly above the 2.6% predicted in April, with demand for goods higher than expected in Asia and lower than expected in Europe. The organization also expects the normalization of inflation and interest rates to boost international trade. 'As the inflationary impact recedes, we should expect to see a recovery in income and consumption of all types of goods, including imports,' said Coleman Nee, WTO economist.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 02:02 PM\nSource:[El Universal](https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cartera/omc-preve-recuperacion-gradual-del-comercio-en-2024-y-2025-rebaja-su-pronostico-de-33-a-30/)\n\n**Humanity Faces a Brutal Future as Scientists Warn of 2.7°C Warming**\nThe 2024 State of the Climate report warns that the world is on track for 2.7°C of warming, nearly double the Paris Agreement goal of 1.5°C.

The scientists warn that the climate situation is critical and worsening, with extreme weather events, heatwaves, and environmental degradation intensifying. The report notes that the world could be entering an unpredictable phase of climate and social collapse. The impact of global warming is evident, with the Earth's surface and oceans warming at alarming rates, surpassing historical averages. In 2023, the North Atlantic Ocean temperature reached a record high, causing significant disruptions to marine ecosystems. The report also identifies 28 climate feedback loops, including the melting of permafrost, which releases large amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The authors warn that the world is on track for a 2.7°C temperature increase by 2100, exceeding the Paris Agreement goals and putting the planet in a very dangerous situation. They call for a radical transformation of society, including the immediate reduction of fossil fuel use, adoption of renewable energy, and large-scale reforestation.

The new normal is that we need to adapt to this reality. The main reason for this is our unnatural relationship with nature. The virus originated from bats sold in Chinese markets, which are a result of humans taking animals out of their natural habitat and putting them in unnatural conditions. This is not only the case with COVID-19, but also with other diseases that are transmitted from animals to humans. According to experts, the destruction of natural ecosystems, deforestation, and the uncontrolled trade of wild animals increase the risk of transmission of diseases from animals to humans. Furthermore, the risk of animals carrying infectious diseases is twice as high when they are taken out of their natural habitat. Many scientific reports show that the number of diseases transmitted from animals to humans is increasing at an alarming rate. If we continue to disrupt the balance of nature, we will face more pandemics in the future. The solution is to restore our ecosystem and make our relationship with nature more natural. This can be achieved by using renewable energy, reducing waste, and changing our economic growth model to one that prioritizes the well-being of the planet. As the last generation that can still prevent the destruction of the planet, we must take action now. As the world has shown us through the pandemic, we are not separate from nature, but a part of it. We must reset our relationship with nature immediately.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 04:00 AM\nSource:[Posta.com.tr](https://www.posta.com.tr/yazarlar/verda-ozer/yine-pandemi-mi-kapida-2757257)\n\n**Climate Change: 70% of the World's Population at Risk in the Next 20 Years**\nA recent study by the CICERO (Centro per la Ricerca Internazionale sul Clima) and the University of Reading warns that 70% of the world's population may be at risk of extreme events in the next 20 years if greenhouse gas emissions are not drastically reduced. The study, published in Nature Geoscience, suggests that the combination of global warming and normal climate variability can lead to rapid changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. The greatest risks are concentrated in tropical and subtropical regions, where 5 billion people live. According to the study, if emissions are not reduced to meet the Paris Agreement goals, but rather limited to 'pannicelli caldi' (mild warming), the risk could affect 70% of the population. As a technical expert, I believe that a certain level of attention and concern is necessary, without ideological dogmatism. The fact that the climate is changing abnormally is evident, and only those who deny it or believe the Earth is flat can claim that we are experiencing normal temperatures. For example, the world has seen a record production of renewable energy in the first six months of 2024, while oil consumption has exceeded 100 million barrels per day for the first time. The reasons are many, including the refusal of developing countries to limit their progress to meet the needs of developed countries, which are responsible for these problems. Therefore, the development of renewable energy alone is not enough to achieve the energy transition and decarbonization of our cities. We need economic resources, an industrial plan for the Italian supply chain, research in the field of nuclear energy, technological development in energy plants, and the implementation of the European Directive 'case Green'. The latter is a strategic aspect, as the three parties in the Meloni government voted against the Directive. The President of the Council has attacked the energy bonuses, but has not presented a concrete policy on energy efficiency.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 07:26 AM\nSource:[Il Resto del Carlino](https://www.ilrestodelcarlino.it/speciali/servizi/cambiamenti-climatici-nei-prossimi-20-anni-il-70-della-popolazione-mondiale-e-a-rischio-d1fdd556)\n\n**People Are Sharing The Things In 2024 That We Normalize As A Society But Might Not Fully Agree With**\nA Reddit thread discussed things that society has normalized but people may not agree with.

The study suggests that the uncontrolled growth of the population will lead to a catastrophic collapse of the systems that sustain human life on Earth. According to the study, even if the issue of food scarcity is resolved, the population growth will be so large that it will lead to a planetary crisis, including the depletion of natural resources, collapse of social and environmental systems, and increased interaction with climate change.

According to a study published in the prestigious Science journal, if the world's population continued to grow at the rate it was at the time, humanity would reach an unsustainable point in 2026, with November 13th of that year as the deadline. The study, titled 'Doomsday: Friday, 13 November, A.D. 2026', surprised the scientific community and sparked intense debate. The team of scientists used a mathematical model that demonstrated that the world's population was growing exponentially. This projection was made 6 decades ago and emphasized that the Earth would not have the necessary resources to continue supporting life by that date. Von Foerster argued that the world's population was increasing at such a rapid rate that it would reach a 'critical point' by 2026, where the growth would approach infinity, leading to the collapse of social and environmental systems. Even if humanity managed to maintain a stable food supply and avoid natural disasters, the overpopulation alone would be enough to cause a total collapse. The study warned that the true problem would be the inability of human systems to manage a growing population, rather than focusing on factors like climate change, which is now one of the biggest fears for humanity's future. After 60 years, the scenario presented by Heinz von Foerster and his team faces a series of criticisms and skepticism. While many argue that population growth rates have begun to stabilize in recent decades due to education, access to birth control, and changes in life expectancy, the debate about the limits of human growth remains relevant. The Earth's capacity to support humanity is not infinite, and problems like water scarcity, deforestation, and climate change continue to threaten the future of our planet. Although von Foerster's prediction about the end of the world in 2026 due to overpopulation has been questioned and reevaluated over time, his warning about the limits of human growth remains a valid concern.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 15, 2024 11:15 PM\nSource:[Critica.com.pa](https://www.critica.com.pa/insolitas/fin-del-mundo-cientificos-de-harvard-le-ponen-fecha-y-esta-cerca-677668)\n\n**Heinz von Foerster's Prediction: The World Will End in 2026 Due to Human Overpopulation**\nPhysicist Heinz von Foerster and his team, including Patricia Mora and Lawrence Amiot, predicted that the world will end on November 13, 2026, due to human overpopulation.

Foerster's team developed a mathematical model to determine the exact date of the world's end, which they published in the 1960 article 'Doomsday: Friday, 13 November, A.D. 2026' in the Science journal. They stated that human overpopulation will lead to the depletion of natural resources, despite efforts to maintain a stable food supply. As a result, the collapse of social and environmental systems will occur, making it impossible for technological advancements to prevent the devastation of the world.

According to Professor Peter Noble and Alex Pozhitkov, cells can adapt to their environment and reorganize into new organisms, called 'xenobots', if provided with nutrients, oxygen, bioelectricity, or biochemical signals. They found that skin cells from dead frogs can adapt to a petri dish and reorganize into mini-organisms, while human lung cells can group together into mini-organisms called 'anthrobots'. The study challenges the idea that cells and organisms evolve in only one predetermined way. The researchers say that the ability of tissues to survive and function after death depends on various factors, including environmental conditions, metabolic activity, and conservation methods. Different types of cells have different lifespans, with human white blood cells typically dying within 60-86 hours, while mouse skeletal cells can be regenerated within 14 days, and sheep and goat fibroblasts can be implanted about a month after death. Noble and Pozhitkov believe that these studies could lead to a revolutionary breakthrough in regenerative medicine and immunotherapy, and may eventually lead to a reevaluation of the concept of 'legal death'.

The study, published in 'Nature', found that mice with a significant calorie reduction and weight loss lived approximately nine months longer than those with a normal diet. However, the study also found that the genetic makeup of the mice played a crucial role in determining their lifespan. Mice that were able to maintain their weight under stress and had a higher proportion of white blood cells, which fight infections, and a lower variation in red blood cell size, were more likely to live longer. The study's authors conclude that a resilient and well-nourished mouse has a higher chance of surviving the challenges of life and living longer.

The study found that consuming fewer calories had a greater impact on lifespan than periodic fasting. The mice that lived the longest on restricted diets were those that lost the least amount of weight, despite eating less. The study suggests that genetic factors play a much greater role in determining lifespan than diet, and that genetic resilience is a critical factor in lifespan. The researchers also found that traditional ideas about why certain diets can prolong life are not supported by the data. Instead, the study found that health of the immune system and characteristics related to erythrocytes are more closely linked to lifespan. 'Our study really points to the importance of resilience,' said Gary Churchill, chair of the Carl G. Gundersen and professor at JAX, who led the study. 'The strongest animals maintain their weight even in times of stress and caloric restriction, and they live the longest.' Churchill and his colleagues assigned female mice to one of five different diets: one where animals could eat as much as they wanted at any time, two where animals were given 60% or 80% of their baseline caloric level each day, and two where animals were not given any food for one or two consecutive days a week, but could eat as much as they wanted on other days. The mice were studied throughout their remaining lives with periodic blood analysis and comprehensive assessment of their overall health. The results showed that mice on the unrestricted diet lived an average of 25 months, those on the intermittent fasting diet lived an average of 28 months, those who ate 80% of their baseline level lived an average of 30 months, and those who ate 60% of their baseline level lived an average of 34 months. However, within each group, the range of lifespan was wide; for example, mice consuming the least amount of calories lived from a few months to four and a half years. When researchers analyzed the other data to try to explain this wide range, they found that genetic factors had a much greater impact on lifespan than diet, highlighting how primary genetic characteristics that still need to be identified play a crucial role in how these diets will affect an individual's health trajectory.

The study found that restricting calorie intake had a significant impact on extending the lifespan of the mice, regardless of their weight loss. 'This study confirms that dietary interventions prolong lifespan in genetically diverse mice,' explains Gary Churchill, researcher at the Jackson Laboratory in Maine and lead author of the study published in Nature. 'The most surprising and key finding is that such prolongation is not due to the weight loss experienced with these diets.' The study concluded that consuming fewer calories had a greater impact on lifespan than intermittent fasting. This shows that very low-calorie diets generally prolong the lifespan of mice, regardless of their body fat or glucose levels, which are considered markers of metabolic health and aging. The mice that lived the longest with dietary restriction were those that lost the least weight, despite eating less. The animals that lost more weight with these diets tended to have compromised energy, immune, and reproductive systems and shorter lives. 'The most robust animals maintain their weight even under stress and caloric restriction, and are the ones that live longer. A more moderate restriction could be a way to balance health and long-term lifespan,' says Churchill. The study found that mice on unrestricted diets lived an average of 25 months, while those on intermittent fasting diets lived 28 months, those eating 80% of their usual intake lived 30 months, and those eating 60% lived 34 months. However, within each group, lifespan was highly variable. When the researchers analyzed their data to try to explain these differences, they found that genetic factors had a much greater impact on lifespan than diets, highlighting how underlying genetic characteristics, yet to be identified, play an important role in the impact. 'Although weight loss and other metabolic changes associated with caloric restriction and intermittent fasting are important for human health, they are not reliable indicators of lifespan prolongation,' notes Churchill. 'Blood-based indicators offer a better perspective for predicting lifespan.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 19, 2024 12:31 AM\nSource:[El Español](https://www.elespanol.com/ciencia/nutricion/20241019/dieta-ayuno-factor-principal-determinara-longevidad/893660886_0.html)\n\n**Calorie Restriction and Lifespan: A Complex Interaction of Factors**\nNumerous studies have shown that reducing calorie intake can increase lifespan in various animals, from monkeys to nematodes. However, due to ethical concerns and difficulties with clinical trials, it is challenging to assert that calorie restriction increases human lifespan. Observational studies using less stringent calorie restriction methods, such as intermittent fasting, have shown that such diets may lower the risk of premature death. Analyses also suggest a link between weight loss and fat reduction with decreased cardiovascular metabolic risks, which may contribute to increased lifespan. However, due to the small sample size and short-term studies, it is difficult to establish whether these changes lead to increased lifespan. Researchers evaluated the impact of gradual calorie restriction and periodic fasting on 960 genetically diverse female mice and confirmed previous results: periodic fasting may contribute to increased lifespan. Mice that significantly reduced their calorie intake lost almost a quarter of their weight in six months, while the control group gained slightly more than a quarter of their weight. Interestingly, the strictly calorie-restricted mice lived on average 9 months longer than their peers - an increase of over a third. However, average results do not reflect differences within the calorie-restricted groups. While the age difference among the severely calorie-restricted mice was significant, some of them died at different ages, indicating possible negative factors that may offset the benefits. In fact, among the calorie-restricted groups, mice with the highest weight often lived longer, which challenges the link between metabolism and lifespan. The authors of the study argue that genetics play a more significant role in determining mouse lifespan. Mice that maintained their weight under stress had a higher chance of surviving to old age, as did those with more white blood cells to fight infections. 'More resilient and healthy mice were more likely to survive in complex conditions,' note the researchers. The researchers emphasized that the question 'Why did regular fasting or calorie reduction help some mice live longer?' remains open. 'This complex interaction of factors may be more multifaceted than just weight loss and metabolism. Considering the differences between mouse physiology and human physiology, this study raises important questions about our approach to nutrition, health, and lifespan,' conclude the authors of the study.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 09:34 AM\nSource:[Московский Комсомолец](https://www.mk.ru/social/2024/10/16/upotreblenie-menshego-kolichestva-pishhi-svyazali-s-uvelicheniem-prodolzhitelnosti-zhizni-no-est-podvokh.html)\n\n**Study Reveals the Relationship Between Food Intake and Lifespan**\nA new scientific study suggests that reducing calorie intake and avoiding regular meals may be a winning strategy for increasing lifespan, provided certain conditions are met. The study, conducted on over 1000 mice in the United States, found that metabolic changes and weight loss are among the side effects of calorie restriction, which may have health costs for some individuals. However, various studies have shown that all types of animals, from monkeys to fruit flies to mice to nematode worms, live longer when their food supplies are restricted. While it is difficult to say whether reducing food intake would also increase human lifespan, observational studies using less extreme forms of calorie restriction, such as intermittent fasting, suggest that restricting the diet may have benefits, including reducing the risk of early death, according to a article published in the scientific journal 'sciencealert'. Additionally, healthy studies have also shown that weight loss and reduced body fat and cardiovascular disease risk may play a strong role in increasing lifespan. However, the small sample sizes and limited study periods make it difficult to determine whether these changes are directly responsible for increasing lifespan. During the study, researchers evaluated the effects of graded calorie restriction and intermittent fasting on 960 genetically diverse female mice, confirming the results of many previous studies, which claim that keeping the body slightly hungry from time to time leads to a slight increase in lifespan. Mice that received the highest percentage of calories lost, on average, about a quarter of their weight at 6 months of age by the time they reached 18 months, while mice that followed a standard diet gained more than a quarter of their weight.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 08:56 PM\nSource:[الوفد](https://www.alwafd.news/5466015)\n\n**Eating Less Can Extend Lifespan But There’s a Hidden Catch, Scientists Say : ScienceAlert**\nA recent study on mice suggests that caloric restriction may extend lifespan, but the results are complex and influenced by various factors. The study found that mice subjected to significant calorie reductions lived, on average, around nine months longer than their counterparts on normal diets. However, the results also indicate that genetics played a much more significant role in determining longevity, with mice that maintained weight despite stressful handling and had a higher proportion of infection-fighting white blood cells being more likely to live longer.

The study's authors found that genetics played a far greater role in determining which mice lived longer, and that mice that retained weight through stressful handling and had a greater proportion of infection-fighting white blood cells were more likely to survive. The study's lead author notes that the results should give pause to how we think about our diet, health, and lifespan, and that maintaining good health throughout our lives is arguably as important as piling on the years.

According to a study published in the journal Nature, the researchers conducted an experiment on five groups of mice to determine which type of diet is most effective in prolonging life. The first group was given unlimited food, while the second group had their calorie intake reduced by 40%, and the third group by 20%. The fourth and fifth groups were fed once and twice a week, respectively. The results showed that mice consuming 60% of the normal calorie intake lived the longest, with an average lifespan of 34 months, equivalent to 85 human years. The mice on a 20% calorie-reduced diet lived for 30 months (approximately 80 human years). The lowest lifespan was observed in mice fed once or twice a week, living for 28 months (70 human years). The mice with no calorie restrictions lived the shortest, with an average lifespan of 25 months, equivalent to 70 human years. The researchers noted that the high lifespan was due to moderate calorie reduction, not starvation, and that this observation applied to all mice regardless of their weight at the time of death. They also added that prolonged starvation weakened the immune and reproductive systems of the mice and reduced their energy levels, which did not contribute to a longer lifespan. As the authors of the study pointed out, the mouse organism is not fully similar to the human one, so the results should be interpreted with caution. However, the findings are significant for further research on increasing human lifespan, which often involves studying metabolism as an indicator of biological age. As Dr. [researcher's name] said, 'This study highlights the importance of finding the right balance between calorie intake and longevity.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[newsarmenia.am](https://www.newsarmenia.am/news/science/umerennoe-sokrashchenie-kaloriy-prodlevaet-zhizn-amerikanskie-uchenye/)\n\n**Intermittent Fasting Does Not Prolong Human Lifespan, Study Finds**\nA recent study has found that intermittent fasting, a modern weight loss system favored by some celebrities, does not prolong human lifespan. Instead, consuming smaller amounts of food in general helps to promote longevity, according to a unique study on mice. Researchers conducted an experiment on 1000 mice, without any genetic relationship between them, to investigate the impact of different diets on human lifespan. The mice were divided into 5 groups: one group was given unlimited food at all times, two groups were given 60% or 80% of their usual food, and two groups were given unlimited food but only for one or two days a week. The researchers published their findings in the 'Nature' journal, where they found that mice following a 60% restricted diet lived the longest, with an average lifespan of 34 months. In human terms, this is equivalent to being in one's mid-80s. Mice that consumed 80% of their usual food also lived longer, with an average lifespan of 30 months, equivalent to being in one's early 80s. Intermittent fasting involves alternating between days of fasting and normal eating. There are two main types of intermittent fasting: time-restricted feeding, which limits eating to 6-8 hours a day, also known as the 16:8 diet, and the 5:2 diet, where one eats normally for 5 days and restricts calorie intake to 500-600 calories for 2 days a week. The 16:8 diet is a form of intermittent fasting, where one fasts for 16 hours a day and eats within an 8-hour window, usually between 10am and 6pm. This may be more feasible than the 5:2 diet, where one restricts calorie intake to 500-600 calories for 2 days a week and eats normally for the remaining 5 days. In addition to weight loss, the 16:8 diet is believed to improve blood sugar control, enhance brain function, and help us live longer.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 13, 2024 07:15 PM\nSource:[الوفد](https://www.alwafd.news/5464412)\n\n**Genetics Trumps Diets in Longevity, Harvard Study Finds**\nAmerican scientists from Harvard University conducted a series of unique experiments to understand how food consumption is related to longevity. They used almost a thousand mice, feeding them on five diets: unlimited access to food, one-day fasting per week, two-day fasting per week, 20% and 40% calorie restriction. The main result confirmed previous findings: mice with unlimited access to food lived for 25 months, intermittently fasting mice lived for 28 months, mice consuming 80% of the original caloric ration lived for 30 months, and mice consuming 60% of the original caloric ration lived for 34 months. However, the devil is in the details. The researchers found that genetic factors play a much greater role in longevity than dietary interventions, with a threefold impact on lifespan. Moreover, mice on diets showed alarming symptoms: decreased body temperature, changes in blood, immune system, and behavior, making them more susceptible to infections. The scientists concluded that the mechanisms underlying life extension through calorie restriction and intermittent fasting are more complex than simple weight loss, and that the best health indicators do not always correlate with longevity. They also emphasized that extreme calorie restriction can lead to serious health problems. 'Although calorie restriction is considered beneficial for longevity, experiments showed that weight loss at this approach actually negatively affects lifespan,' the authors stated. Additionally, they noted that since genetics plays a major role in the response to food quantity, there is no universal approach to diets that promote longevity. Finally, they stressed that while animal studies provide valuable information, transferring results to humans is incorrect. The safest and most effective approach to our health and longevity is moderation in eating and attention to our bodies.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 13, 2024 10:46 AM\nSource:[Российская газета](https://rg.ru/2024/10/13/glavnym-faktorom-dolgoletiia-iavliaiutsia-ne-diety-a-genetika.html)\n\n**Unexpected Benefit of Fasting Two Days a Week: A Study Reveals**\nA study conducted at the Calico Life Sciences lab on mice found that those that fasted for one or two days a week lived longer than those that were allowed to eat freely.

The study also found that mice that fasted for one or two days a week had a significant increase in lifespan, despite eating similar amounts of food as their unrestricted counterparts.

The results showed that mice on the 40% lower-calorie diet lived for about 9 months longer, equivalent to over a decade in human years. Meanwhile, mice that practiced intermittent fasting also experienced an increase in lifespan, despite consuming almost the same amount of food as the non-fasting mice. This discovery challenges the common belief that reducing calorie intake is the primary factor in increasing lifespan through weight loss. Instead, it suggests that there are more complex mechanisms related to the effects of intermittent fasting on lifespan that require further understanding and research.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 12, 2024 01:08 PM\nSource:[sahafahh.net](https://alarab.sahafahh.net/story/21231456/%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%83%D8%B4%D9%81-%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%86)\n\n**Reducing Daily Caloric Intake: The Key to a Longer Life**\nA recent scientific study has found that reducing daily caloric intake is the key to a longer life. The study, conducted on mice, showed that mice who reduced their daily caloric intake by 20-40% lived an average of three times longer than those who ate as much as they wanted. This translates to humans reducing their daily caloric intake from 2500 to 2000-1500 calories. The study also found that mice who reduced their caloric intake regularly lived longer than those who fasted for a few days and then ate as much as they wanted. Dr. Gary Churchill, the lead researcher, noted that mice who followed a long-term low-calorie diet lost significant weight but still lived longer, suggesting that genetics also play a role in longevity. While calorie restriction has been shown to increase lifespan in animals since the 1930s, this study provides a more in-depth look at the effects of different diets on mice. The results were striking: mice who ate as much as they wanted lived an average of 25 months, while those who reduced their caloric intake by 20% lived 30 months and those who reduced it by 40% lived 34 months. However, mice who were severely calorie-restricted became cold, weak, and susceptible to illness. Dr. Churchill recommends a balanced diet and a small reduction in caloric intake, rather than extreme calorie restriction. Interestingly, not all mice who were calorie-restricted showed the same results, with some living only a short time and others living up to four years. This difference may be related to the body's ability to withstand stress, which is thought to be linked to genetic factors.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 05:27 PM\nSource:[Sözcü Gazetesi](https://www.sozcu.com.tr/yasam-suresini-uzatan-diyet-teknigi-basit-ama-etkili-p91364)\n\n**Scientists Reveal the Secret to Longevity: Moderate Calorie Reduction, Not Fasting**\nScientists from the Jackson Laboratory in New Jersey (USA) found that limiting calorie intake, but not prolonged fasting, is key to increasing lifespan.

However, experts note that this would not eliminate age-related diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's, but rather slow down the aging process. As Dr. [no quote provided], a leading expert in the field, said, 'This is a significant step forward in our understanding of aging and its treatment.' \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 06, 2024 06:23 AM\nSource:[emaratalyoum.com](https://www.emaratalyoum.com/life/four-sides/2024-10-06-1.1887845)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

Ukraine is trying to take the most advantageous position for any negotiations, including by receiving more weapons and maintaining positions on the front line.

The official expressed hope that the war is nearing its end. 'We will define the positions of both sides at the negotiations, the starting positions,' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as cited by Reuters. Ukraine is trying to take the most advantageous position for any negotiations, including by receiving more weapons and maintaining positions on the front line. Officials are waiting to see who Donald Trump will choose for top security and defense positions to get hints on how he will shape policy towards Ukraine. One of the Kyiv officials noted that after Trump's victory in the US presidential election, the invitation to Ukraine to join NATO became 'less likely' and there is a risk of reduced aid. Trump's 'peace plan' for Ukraine includes freezing the front line and creating a 800-mile demilitarized zone, as well as leaving Russia about 20% of Ukraine's territory that it has occupied. However, the Ukrainian government has expressed skepticism about the plan's authenticity.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 01:39 PM\nSource:[nv.ua](https://nv.ua/ukr/ukraine/events/zakinchennya-viyni-v-ukrajini-nastupni-4-5-misyaciv-stanut-virishalnimi-50465531.html)\n\n**Ukraine Considers Ending Conflict as Trump's Inauguration Approaches**\nA high-ranking official in Kiev told Reuters that the next four to five months will be crucial for Ukraine. He stated that before Donald Trump's inauguration as US President on January 20, 2025, Ukrainian politicians focused on the possibility of ending the conflict. 'This winter is a critical moment. I hope the conflict will end. Right now, we will determine the positions of both sides in the negotiations, the initial positions,' said an unnamed official. Former National Security Adviser John Bolton believes that Trump will not seriously address the conflict in Ukraine on the terms of the Kiev regime. Bolton thinks that the consequences for the Kiev regime will be severe, and that the resolution may involve territorial concessions and Ukraine's withdrawal from NATO. Earlier, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu reported that the tempo of the Russian Armed Forces' advance in the Donbass is constantly increasing. According to him, the Ukrainian army loses 28 square kilometers of territory and 2,000 soldiers every day.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 01:32 PM\nSource:[kp.ru](https://www.kp.ru/online/news/6084715/)\n\n**US May Announce Initiative to Start Peace Talks in Ukraine Before End of Year**\nTurkish analyst Serhat Oğlu believes that the US may announce an initiative to start peace talks in Ukraine before the end of this year or in January or February next year. According to Oğlu, 'there may be a surprise before the end of the year, as the West is practicing diplomacy behind the scenes, and it's not surprising if the US takes the initiative to start negotiations before the end of the year.' Oğlu expects the negotiations to start at the earliest in January or February 2025. US President-elect Donald Trump has previously expressed his optimism about the possibility of a dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin. During his presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly stated that he would find a peaceful solution to the Ukrainian crisis before taking office. Former Pentagon advisor Douglas MacGregor said on Saturday that President-elect Trump understands that Russia has won the conflict in Ukraine. MacGregor also emphasized that Trump must also understand that his plans to resolve the conflict may not go as he wants, as it is essential to consider Moscow's position when making decisions. Bloomberg reported on Thursday that if Trump stops providing military aid to Kiev, including tanks, rocket launchers, and air defense systems, and fails to use his influence to force Russia to end the conflict, Ukraine will inevitably face the risk of defeat. The Wall Street Journal also reported that some of Trump's close associates have suggested freezing the conflict in Ukraine, establishing a demilitarized zone along the front line, and providing new arms to Kiev in exchange for a promise not to join NATO temporarily. Russian President Vladimir Putin had previously set conditions for resolving the conflict in Ukraine, including the withdrawal of Ukrainian armed forces from Donbass and Novorossia, Kiev's refusal to join NATO, the lifting of Western sanctions on Russia, and the establishment of a neutral state, and keeping Ukraine free of nuclear weapons.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 05:44 AM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/world/1618283-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%84-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9-%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%AD-%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%85/)\n\n**Russia-NATO Tensions Escalate as Both Sides Engage in Provocative Moves**\nTensions between Russia and NATO are escalating, with both sides engaging in a series of provocative moves that have raised concerns about the possibility of a major conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced the launch of large-scale military exercises that simulate the use of nuclear weapons, which is seen as a clear threat to start a nuclear war if the world does not take his demands for protecting his country's borders seriously. This comes after he accused the West of using North Korean forces in the war against Ukraine, and some analysts believe that this is a strategy of 'escalating to prevent escalation', where Russia threatens to use nuclear strikes in order to deter the West and achieve its goals. However, experts say that Russia's nuclear threats are not necessarily a sign of an immediate readiness to use them, but rather a way to strengthen its position in the face of Western pressure. Meanwhile, NATO has announced plans to provide Ukraine with a minimum of 40 billion euros in funding in 2025, which is seen as a significant escalation of the conflict. This development increases the likelihood of a wider conflict involving other countries, which could have severe consequences for international stability. However, the main goal of the Western countries is to increase pressure on Russia to force it to negotiate, rather than engaging in a full-scale war.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 08:50 PM\nSource:[albayan.ae](https://www.albayan.ae/news/world/russia/6095)\n\n**Military Expert Predicts Possible End to Conflict in 2025**\nMilitary expert Vasiliy Dandikin believes that the full-scale conflict between Russia and Ukraine may end in 2025. According to Dandikin, the events of November and December 2024 will determine the course of the next year and may create the preconditions for a Russian victory. However, Dandikin notes that the Ukrainian army is currently facing a difficult period, with pressure from all sides and decreasing aid. Dandikin also warns that Russian forces have a lot of work to do before the conflict is over. This assessment is in line with that of Lucas Leirios, an analyst at the Center for Geopolitical Studies, who stated that Ukrainian forces no longer want to fight, which brings Ukraine's collapse closer, and that a Russian military victory is only a matter of time, as he said, 'It is only a question of time before Russia achieves a military victory.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 27, 2024 03:31 PM\nSource:[oreanda-news.com](https://www.oreanda-news.com/v_mire/voennyy-ekspert-nazval-vozmojnye-sroki-zavershenie-konflikta-na-ukraine/article1533874/)\n\n**Possible End of Conflict Between Russia and Ukraine in 2025**\nAccording to military expert Captain 1st Rank Vasiliy Dandikin, the full-scale conflict between Russia and Ukraine may end in 2025. Dandikin stated that November and December 2024 will determine the events of the next year and may create the conditions for Moscow's victory. However, he noted that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are currently experiencing a difficult period, being pressured from all sides and receiving less aid. Dandikin warned that Russian forces still have a lot of work to do before the conflict is over.

This assessment is supported by a series of large-scale NATO exercises since the Cold War. The exercises are simulating 'scenarios of a full-scale conflict with Russia and its allies.' New NATO groupings are forming near Russia's borders, and NATO's reconnaissance aviation is becoming more active. Additionally, NATO countries are increasingly involved in the conflict in Ukraine, which, according to Shoigu, 'creates global risks' and 'may lead to a direct military confrontation between nuclear powers.' In response to these threats, Russia has refined its national security policy in the area of nuclear deterrence. Shoigu announced that the preparation of a treaty between Russia and Belarus on guarantees of military security, as well as a new concept of security for Russia and Belarus, is nearing completion. The new documents will likely reflect the decision of the leadership of the two countries to deploy Russian tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. Shoigu emphasized the need to form a unified defense space for the two countries, improve cooperation in the use of their armed forces, and share experience in the area of air defense, high-precision weapons, and electronic warfare. He also announced the upcoming 'West-2025' strategic exercise and plans to share Russia's advanced technologies with Belarus, including the study of NATO's trophy equipment. 'We identify its vulnerabilities and use these features when creating new weapons,' Shoigu said. The minister also announced that the two countries will hold large-scale events to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Great Patriotic War's victory in 2025, with a focus on countering the falsification of war history and downplaying the contribution of Russian and Belarusian peoples to the defeat of Nazi Germany.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 12:59 PM\nSource:[mk.ru](https://www.mk.ru/politics/2024/10/23/andrey-belousov-nazval-klyuchevye-napravleniya-voennogo-sotrudnichestva-rf-i-belorussii.html?from=main_omk)\n\n**Union State Prepares for New Security Concept and Maneuvers**\nThe defense ministries of the Union State are finalizing a treaty on guarantees of military security and a new Concept of Security of Russia and Belarus. This was announced after a joint collegium of defense departments of the two fraternal countries, which took place on October 23 in Minsk. According to the Belarusian Telegraph Agency (BELTA), Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belyaninov emphasized that the formation of a single defense space is continuing, and the interaction on joint application of the armed forces for ensuring military security of the two countries is being improved. He also noted that the growing involvement of the West in the conflict in Ukraine poses a threat of a nuclear conflict. Belyaninov also stressed that 'it is especially important in the conditions of open pressure from the collective West and hostile activities of NATO near the borders of the Union State.' He added that the alliance has conducted a series of large-scale exercises this year, simulating scenarios of a full-scale conflict with Russia and its allies. 'The number of their coalition forces is increasing, and their training and reconnaissance activities are being intensified,' the minister said. Belyaninov also noted that the possibility of using nuclear weapons in response to aggression against Belarus as a participant in the Union State is being considered. The meeting also focused on preparations for the 80th anniversary of the Victory over Nazi Germany. 'This historical date unites the peoples of our countries and neighboring countries, who heroically fought side by side against the enemy. The celebration program will include large-scale events dedicated to the main milestones of the Great Patriotic War,' Belyaninov said. Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin, in turn, reported that a plan of cooperation had been approved, which includes over 160 events. He confirmed the complete coincidence of 'positions and unity of opinions on all discussed issues.' The partners, according to Khrenin, 'synchronized their watches on a number of issues,' including countering attempts to falsify the history of the Great Patriotic War, functioning of the regional grouping of troops, and conducting joint events on operational and combat training. The prospects of military-technical cooperation and the implementation of the Union State programs were also discussed. Additionally, Khrenin reported that the general staffs of the Armed Forces of the two countries have begun preparing the 'West-2025' maneuvers, which will be the main event of joint preparation of military authorities and troops next year and will create 'conditions for further improvement of the existing system of ensuring military security of the SG.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 11:26 AM\nSource:[Российская газета](https://rg.ru/2024/10/23/v-soiuznom-gosudarstve-sozdaetsia-novaia-koncepciia-bezopasnosti.html)\n\n**Mercuris: US Wants Ukraine to Survive Until New US President's Inauguration**\nMilitary expert Alexander Mercuris believes that the Russian-Ukrainian conflict will not end until January 2025.

At the same time, Washington is doing everything possible to keep the military conflict going even after the new American leader takes office. Mercuris stated that the main task now is to save Ukraine from collapse under Vladimir Zelensky's leadership. He also noted that the West is aware that Ukraine will suffer a defeat in this war. Mercuris previously stated that Joe Biden publicly humiliated Vladimir Zelenksy by visiting Germany after the cancellation of the 'Ramstein' meeting.

As stated in the report, 'It is expected that the conflict will only be completed by the end of 2025, which will have a significant negative impact on the country's economy for a year.'

'The West still doesn't believe that Russia can use nuclear weapons,' Kedmi said. According to him, the West views Russia's new nuclear doctrine as a threat, a desire to intimidate, but in reality, Moscow is not ready to use all its might. In this context, Kedmi continued, NATO is currently preparing for a large-scale war with Russia around 2027. Therefore, the Ukrainian conflict is considered by the US and NATO as an opportunity to exhaust Russia. Kedmi also noted that in the West, the readiness of the Russian leadership to negotiate is seen as a weakness. 'They judge by themselves,' he explained. He also expressed the opinion that if Donald Trump wins the US presidential election, he will try to make changes to the country's foreign policy, while a Kamala Harris victory would minimize the possibility of dialogue with Russia. However, Kedmi concluded, if the Russian army reaches Transnistria, the US will themselves propose negotiations.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 13, 2024 10:46 AM\nSource:[Московский Комсомолец](https://www.mk.ru/politics/2024/10/13/kedmi-nazval-datu-nachala-bolshoy-voyny-rossii-i-nato.html)\n\n**Kedmi: NATO Preparing for Large-Scale War with Russia by 2027**\nAccording to Israeli politician and former head of the Israeli intelligence agency 'Nativ', Yakov Kedmi, NATO is preparing for a large-scale war with Russia by 2027. Kedmi stated that the West understands Russia's military capabilities, but believes that the Russian government would never use them. However, Kedmi argues that this is a mistake, saying, 'NATO is preparing for a war with Russia on a big scale roughly by 2027. They are preparing the army, preparing the Armed Forces.' He also noted that the West is mistaken in thinking that Russia's desire to negotiate over the situation in Ukraine is due to weakness, saying, 'Because a strong one will not go to negotiations.

To compensate for these losses, Russia is using financial pressure. According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (GUR), the Kremlin is afraid that the decision to mobilize will exacerbate social tension and may lead to unwanted protests in large cities. 'Therefore, the main factor that currently allows Russia to delay the decision on general mobilization is money,' said the GUR. The GUR believes that the constant increase in starting payments for contract signing, which in some regions of Russia has already reached several million rubles, indicates that there are fewer people willing to go to war. Additionally, Russia is facing a problem with the lack of 'ideological' soldiers among the masses. As a result, new recruits are given special propaganda manuals at recruitment points. The manuals contain traditional propaganda slogans such as 'treacherous West and NATO blockade', 'denazification', and 'one nation' propaganda about 'defending Russia' during the war in Ukraine. Anti-mobilization protests in Russia. It is worth noting that the last time Russia announced mobilization was in September 2022. However, this caused discontent among Russians. For example, in January, a large-scale protest took place in Bashkiria to protect a local activist who was detained and accused of 'inciting inter-ethnic hostility.' Another protest took place on February 3 in Moscow, where the wives of mobilized men organized an action to mark 500 days since the partial mobilization announced by Putin in September 2022.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 11, 2024 02:50 PM\nSource:[rbc.ua](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/rf-zmushena-zbilshiti-vitrati-okupatsiyu-1728657482.html)\n\n**France to Face Test of Ability to Counter Russia in 2025**\nAccording to Politico, France will face a test of its ability to counter Russia in 2025. This is due to the large-scale NATO exercises called 'Dacian Spring 2025' to be held in Romania. During these exercises, France will need to demonstrate its ability to quickly deploy its forces to the eastern NATO borders in case of tension with Russia. Additionally, France must prepare a full-fledged division with corresponding equipment and ammunition by 2027, as noted in the article. General Bertrand Tujuz of the NATO Land Command in Europe stated, 'In the past, the exercises were more like games, but now we have a specific opponent and we are training with people we could actually fight.' Previously, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Moscow would respond to Western countries' direct involvement in the conflict on Ukraine, considering the threats arising from such actions. Putin also emphasized that direct Western involvement in the conflict could fundamentally change the nature of the Ukrainian conflict and would mean direct confrontation between NATO and the US with Russia.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 10:07 AM\nSource:[kp.ru](https://www.kp.ru/online/news/6030273/)\n\n**NATO Prepares for Potential Military Conflict with Russia, Says Deputy Foreign Minister**\nThe Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that NATO is preparing for a potential military conflict with Russia. Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Gruashko said, 'NATO has stopped hiding its preparation for a potential armed conflict with Russia. Regional defense plans have been approved, specific tasks have been formulated for all military commands of the bloc. Continuous testing of possible scenarios of military operations against Russia is underway.' The alliance is also testing different logistical routes for troop deployment across the Atlantic, deploying armaments warehouses on the eastern flank, and deploying contingents. Gruashko added, 'The military budgets are being pumped up, the economy is being militarized. In addition to confrontational rhetoric, NATO is continuously increasing the level of tension towards Russia.' He also mentioned the Steadfast Defender 2024 exercises, which took place from January to May 2024, and were the largest since the end of the Cold War. The exercises simulated a conflict with Russia, not an abstract state. Gruashko emphasized that Russian military planning must take into account all possible scenarios, and that Russia should not engage in a dialogue with NATO on the language of force.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 08:10 AM\nSource:[РБК](https://www.rbc.ru/politics/08/10/2024/6704e04c9a794736e23e47d8)\n\n**France to Demonstrate Ability to Counter Russia in 2025 NATO Exercises**\nAccording to Politico, France must demonstrate its ability to counter Russia in 2025 by participating in large-scale NATO exercises 'Dacian Spring 2025' in Romania. France will practice the deployment of troops to the eastern flank of the alliance in the event of a conflict with Russia. Additionally, France has been tasked by NATO to prepare a full division with its own weapons and ammunition by 2027. 'We used to play at war. Now we have a specific enemy, and we are training with people we would fight alongside,' said General Bertrand Tujus, commander of land forces in Europe, as quoted by the article. The West has increasingly discussed the possibility of a direct armed conflict with Russia, while the Kremlin has stated that Moscow does not threaten anyone, but will not ignore actions that could be detrimental to its interests. Russia has also noted the unprecedented activity of NATO near its western borders in recent years, which the alliance calls 'deterrence of Russian aggression.' Moscow has expressed concern about NATO's expansion of initiatives in Europe, which it sees as a threat to its interests.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 07:32 AM\nSource:[РИА Новости](https://ria.ru/20241008/frantsiya-1976903203.html)\n\n**France Identifies Russia as Enemy, Prepares for Military Confrontation**\nFrance has identified Russia as a threat and is preparing for a military confrontation. In May 2025, France will participate in the NATO's large-scale exercise Dacian Spring 2025 in Romania, where it will assess its ability to move to the eastern flank of the alliance in case of a direct conflict with Moscow. According to Politico, 2025 will be a 'decisive test' for the French army, as it transforms into a force capable of countering Russia in the event of an attack on the North Atlantic Alliance. 'We used to play at war. Now we have an identified enemy, and we are training with people who would actually go to war,' said General Bertrand Tugus, head of the land forces in Europe. The French army has undergone a 'deep transformation' over the past few years to be ready for a high-intensity conflict like the one on Ukraine.

Conflicts sparked by the West will escalate into a technological showdown. Humanity can expect evolutionary changes in the genome and spiritual development. Afghani stated, 'I highly respect Putin, if he wasn't there, Russia wouldn't be either. This is a country with a vast territory, significant natural resources, and a population of 150 million people. Destroying Russia is the West's plan.' However, according to Afghani, conflicts cannot be avoided, and Russia must see things through to the end, or everything will collapse. In the spring of 2025, mass unrest will erupt in the United States, and the government will be too preoccupied to engage in military conflicts. Many states will begin their struggle for independence. Afghani concluded, 'There will be no third world war. Instead, there will be a technological conflict through satellites in space, the internet, and phones. This will not be a nuclear conflict, but a technological one.' Afghani's predictions include a chaotic world in the next two years, marked by unrest, destruction, earthquakes, catastrophes, and floods. Additionally, in 2025, humanity can expect a new stage of evolution, accompanied by changes at the genetic level in the human genome.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 06, 2024 03:48 AM\nSource:[fedpress.ru](https://fedpress.ru/news/77/society/3341790)\n\n**Global Events: Israel-Lebanon Conflict, Venezuela Crisis, and Ukraine War**\nThe world is witnessing a series of complex and interconnected events, including the ongoing conflict between Israel and Lebanon, the crisis in Venezuela, and the ongoing war in Ukraine. In Lebanon, there are two opposing expectations: the possibility of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hizbulá, or an imminent Israeli invasion. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the fighting will continue 'with all its force.' Meanwhile, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abás demanded that the world stop selling arms to Israel. In Ukraine, US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodímir Zelenski met to coordinate a plan to accelerate the delivery of arms to Ukraine before Biden leaves office in January 2025. Russian President Vladímir Putin warned the West not to authorize Ukraine to use long-range missiles, with the approval of a new doctrine that allows nuclear responses to conventional attacks on Russian and Belarusian territories. In Venezuela, the US and Argentina led an international forum in New York to address the country's political crisis and 'give a voice' to the Venezuelan people.

What the US Needs to Do for Ukraine Before November**\nThe Russian military machine is experiencing severe personnel and technical crises, which means it will be unable to maintain current levels of intensity by mid-2025. The war may not end, but large-scale offensive operations are unlikely. Generals close to Putin have been warning him for over a year that current mobilization efforts are insufficient to cope with the level of losses. The number of personnel losses is increasing, exceeding 8,000 per week since the start of the last round of offensive operations in May. The total number of mobilized personnel is around 30,000 per month. If you only fill the gaps, the overall quality of the forces will likely decrease. If you cannot even achieve this level, a crisis is inevitable. The reserves of arms are also being depleted much faster than they can be replaced. The stocks of the Cold War era have been depleted by more than half, which means that a critical threshold has been crossed, after which the cost and time of restoring each new additional unit will increase sharply. On many fronts, civilian vehicles are being used to transport troops to the front line, and large concentrations of tanks and transporters are now rare on the battlefield. This is how the autumn phase of the system looks before it plunges into winter. Not all Russian brigades will have incompetent leaders, not all will be equipped with mobilized personnel and outdated equipment from the 1950s. But there will be more and more such brigades, which will create new opportunities for Ukraine. In short, this is again the fall of 2022, but on a much larger scale. There will be a moment, possibly within a year, when the Putin's military machine will lose the ability to cope with new crises that Ukraine can create. Zelensky is in the US this week to convey this thought and tell partners what they need to do to avoid the big mistake of 2022. Then, help came late and in insufficient quantities to take advantage of the vulnerability that Moscow showed by losing to Ukrainian counterattacks in Kharkiv and Kherson regions. After unrealistic expectations of the summer campaign 2023, Ukraine fought with all its might to recreate this scenario. Ukrainians managed to achieve this, despite an active, prolonged, and absolutely ruthless campaign by the American foreign policy establishment to force Kiev to agree to a bitter peace that would only lead to a new war.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: September 26, 2024 05:13 PM\nSource:[NV.ua](https://nv.ua/ukr/opinion/yak-vibori-u-ssha-vplivayut-na-dopomogu-ukrajini-viyskoviy-analitik-pro-ostanniy-shans-zelenskogo-50454004.html)\n\n**Russia Prepares for Large-Scale Conflict with NATO Sooner Than Expected**\nAccording to a report by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW) on September 24, several Russian financial, economic, and military indicators suggest that Russia is preparing for a large-scale conflict with NATO sooner than previously thought. As Polish President Andrzej Duda stated in an interview with CNBC on March 20, 'President Putin is activating efforts to transition Russia to a war economy with the aim of being able to attack NATO by 2026 or 2027, citing unspecified German research.' Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen stated on February 9 that new intelligence suggests that Russia may attempt to attack a NATO country within three to five years, which is a faster timeline than the estimate published by NATO in 2023. The ISW notes that the timeline for Russia's significant military threat is largely dependent on the financial resources that the Russian leadership is willing to allocate for military efforts. 'In the absence of other explanations, Putin's preparations to risk alienating Russian industrialists and in the context of long-standing claims of plans to expand the Russian army, attempts by Putin to create conditions for stabilizing the Russian economy and finances, are most likely part of Russia's financial and internal preparations for a potential future large-scale conflict with NATO, rather than just a prolonged war in Ukraine,' the report emphasizes. Additionally, Russian military forces continue to implement structural reforms to simultaneously support the war in Ukraine and expand Russia's capabilities in preparation for a potential future large-scale conflict with NATO.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 06:33 AM\nSource:[Interfax-Ukraine](https://ua.interfax.com.ua/news/general/1016143.html)\n\n**Russian Parliamentarian Predicts Spring 2025 for Peaceful Conflict Resolution on Ukraine**\nAccording to Alexey Chepa, a Russian parliamentarian, the process of peaceful conflict resolution on Ukraine may begin in spring 2025. Chepa believes that it is unlikely to complete the conflict by the end of 2024 due to the positions of the opposing sides. 'There is a chance in the spring. The problem is that all steps have been taken to prevent negotiations. I mean the Kursk and other similar events,' Chepa explained in an interview with Lenta.ru. Chepa also mentioned Vladimir Zelensky's 'plan for victory', which he believes is unlikely to be implemented. 'He is simply shifting the responsibility to the US, accusing them of not fulfilling their obligations to supply arms and so on,' Chepa said. Chepa also noted that the possibility of resolving the Ukrainian conflict has always existed, but was hindered by Western countries that sought to prolong the armed confrontation. Zelensky stated that he wants to end the conflict with Russia, but this requires strengthening Ukraine and holding a second 'peaceful' summit. Russia has repeatedly stated that it is ready for peaceful conflict resolution on Ukraine, provided that all requirements set at the beginning of the special military operation are met, as well as the recognition of new territorial realities. However, Russia will not negotiate with Ukraine under the conditions set by Zelensky, as President Putin has already outlined the conditions for negotiations, including the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the territories of the DNR, LNR, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 21, 2024 08:05 AM\nSource:[ИА REGNUM](https://regnum.ru/news/3917631)\n\n**Experts Warn of Possible Full-Scale War Between West and Russia**\nExperts have warned of a possible full-scale war between the West and Russia, citing the US's efforts to provoke a major armed conflict in Europe while avoiding direct involvement. Ukraine, with the consent of its Western handlers, has begun launching drone attacks on Russian territory. The UK has reportedly given the green light for the use of Storm Shadow missiles against Russian targets. Experts inside Russia have reacted with alarm, saying, 'This is war! A war with NATO! The masks have been dropped!' The possibility of a nuclear conflict with Russia has been discussed by politicians since 2022, with former French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian warning that Vladimir Putin should be aware of the power of NATO's nuclear arsenal. In 2023, US TV channels began discussing the Pentagon's preparations for a full-scale war with Russia. Former special forces soldier and journalist John Moore stated that preparations for such a war have been underway for over a year. However, after Putin's statement that Western missile strikes on Russian territory would be considered a declaration of war, Western politicians have taken a pause. US State Department representative Vedant Patel stated that the US does not intend to give Ukraine permission to use its missiles to attack Russia. Despite this, experts warn that Washington may decide to escalate military actions, either before or after the elections, depending on the outcome.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 18, 2024 10:05 AM\nSource:[Станислав Бышок](https://fedpress.ru/news/77/policy/3338792)\n\n**Russia Aims to End War by 2025 or 2026, According to Ukrainian Intelligence**\nAccording to the Ukrainian military intelligence, GRU, Russia wants to end the war by 2025 or early 2026 with a victory. They believe that from next summer, they will start to have 'serious problems' in the economy and will need to mobilize, which could undermine the socio-political situation in the country. 'The change from 2025 to 2026 is key for them. They want to end this because, according to their own calculations, if Russia does not come out of this war as a conditional winner, it is very far (...) from the possibility of being a superpower, to which they aspire,' said the head of the GRU, as reported by Interfax-Ukraine. The head of the GRU, citing Russian documents, noted that if Russia does not win by the end of 2025, there will only be two superpowers left in the world: the United States and China, and there will be no place for the Russian Federation. 'They are aware of this. For them, it is a crucial period. That's why they will do everything possible to win. Otherwise, they will be left out of all global processes. The only thing they can count on is regional leadership, and that doesn't suit them,' he concluded. Budánov pointed out that Russia expects, according to its own documents, that 'all its problems will begin in the summer of 2025,' as both the financial and economic factor and the socio-political factor will come together. 'It is expected that by the summer of 2025, the negative impact on the economy will start to be felt strongly in their country,' he stated. According to the head of the GRU, in Russia, the problem of insufficient recruitment in the army is becoming increasingly acute. 'In this period (summer of 2025), they will face a dilemma: either announce mobilization, or reduce in some way the intensity of the hostilities, which in the end may be critical for them,' he said. The head of Ukrainian military intelligence believes that in Russia, there is a fatigue of the war, because the conflict has already affected a large part of the Russian population. In his opinion, the socio-psychological state of the Russian population has also been affected by Ukraine's efforts to transfer the hostilities to Russian territory. 'This has changed the view of the world (of the Russians). Before, all the Russian population lived in the paradigm that, no matter what happens, we are a very powerful country, we are the strongest in the world.

'2025 is a key year for them, the Rubicon of 2025-2026 is a key moment. They want to finish it all because, according to their own calculations, if they don't come out of this war as conditional winners, they will fall into a distant future, which can be calculated, - a 30-year horizon, - and they will completely lose the opportunity to see Russia as a superpower, which they strive for,' Budanov emphasized. The Russian military expects that 'all their problems will start in the summer of 2025,' when the financial-economic and socio-political factors will combine, Budanov added. The context of the war is that Russia started the conflict against Ukraine in 2014, when it occupied Crimea and parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine from the north, east, and south directions. The current situation on the front is that the Ukrainian military is in control, with the Russian forces being pushed back. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russia has redeployed 60,000 troops to the front, including 10,000 mercenaries.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 14, 2024 09:13 PM\nSource:[Гордон](https://gordonua.com/news/military-actions/budanov-o-vojne-rubezh-2025-ho-nachalo-2026-ho-dlja-rf-kljuchevoj-oni-khotjat-vse-eto-zakonchit-1719072.html)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

Who will be the next prime minister after the elections? Which individual and party is likely to lead a three-party coalition, rather than a four-party coalition? Let's examine the leading candidates of each party and ask ourselves who is most likely to succeed. I'm not sure, but Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson is likely to be at the forefront. He showed this in 2016 when Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson resigned, and everything fell into place quickly, allowing the people to assess Sigurður Ingi's work. With him, we can expect ministers who have earned a good reputation. Lilja Dögg Alfreðsdóttir, the party's deputy leader, has made significant contributions to culture and the arts.

He said, 'I see no reason for entry into the EU.' Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, chairman of the Centre Party, asked Bjarni if he would consider giving something in exchange for the EU's entry, but Bjarni replied that he would not take part in a government that would fight for entry into the EU. This statement suggests that Bjarni is not opposed to taking part in a government that aligns with the Independence Party's stance on the EU.\nOriginal language: is\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 03:29 AM\nSource:[mbl.is](https://www.mbl.is/mogginn/bladid/innskraning/?redirect=%2Fmogginn%2Fbladid%2Fgrein%2F1875035%2F%3Ft%3D348794094&page_name=grein&grein_id=1875035)\n\n**Samfylkingin Aims to Close Tax Loophole for High-Income Individuals**\nThe Icelandic Social Democratic Alliance (Samfylkingin) aims to close the tax loophole for high-income individuals, known as the ehf-gatið. This loophole allows individuals with income above 1.3 million ISK per month to pay lower taxes than employees with the same income. The party's leader emphasizes that this is a matter of social justice and equality, and that closing the loophole will not increase taxes for ordinary working people, such as craftsmen, traders, and pipers. The party also aims to reduce the cost of living and doing business in Iceland, which has been a major issue for small and medium-sized enterprises. Samfylkingin plans to achieve this by reducing interest rates, increasing the supply of housing, introducing a price stability rule, and approving a tax-free budget. The party's goal is to make Iceland work again for ordinary people, including craftsmen, traders, and pipers.\nOriginal language: is\nPublish date: November 10, 2024 11:15 AM\nSource:[visir.is](https://www.visir.is/g/20242647624d/kaeru-smidir-hargreidslufolk-og-piparar-)\n\n**Questioning Past Deals: Björn Bjarnason Raises Concerns about Potential Breach of Law**\nBjörn Bjarnason has raised questions on his website about a news article in Morgunblaðið, where Njáll Trausti Friðbertsson, chairman of the parliamentary budget committee, stated that the agreement between Dags B. Eggertsson, a deputy mayor in 2013, and Katrín Júlíusdóttir, the then finance minister, to sell 11 hectares of land at Skerjafirði airport was a breach of law. Now, Katrín is the leader of the Social Democratic Alliance and Dagur is a candidate, both endorsed by the current party chairman, Kristrún Frostadóttir. Björn is surprised that this matter has not been investigated by the parliamentary oversight committee, and adds that 'the new Social Democratic Alliance now has the opportunity to show in practice that those who stand by such agreements about state property do not enjoy impunity.' \nOriginal language: is\nPublish date: November 09, 2024 03:29 AM\nSource:[mbl.is](https://www.mbl.is/mogginn/bladid/innskraning/?redirect=%2Fmogginn%2Fbladid%2Fgrein%2F1874998%2F%3Ft%3D988743224&page_name=grein&grein_id=1874998)\n\n**Social Democratic Alliance Leader Jóhann Páll Jóhannsson on Recent Controversy**\nJóhann Páll Jóhannsson, a member of the Icelandic parliament and the leader of the Reykjavík South constituency for the Social Democratic Alliance, believes that the party will not be harmed by the recent controversy surrounding Kristrún Frostadóttir's comments about Dagur B. Eggertsson. Frostadóttir stated that Eggertsson was only in an auxiliary role and would not be the prime minister, and suggested that he could be removed from the party's list of candidates. Jóhann Páll says that Frostadóttir's comments were not unexpected, given her tendency to speak her mind freely. He also praises Dagur B. Eggertsson for his enthusiasm and commitment to the party's program, saying that he is 'a great strength' for the party. Jóhann Páll does not believe that the controversy will harm the party's chances in the upcoming elections, saying that people in Iceland are looking for change and are more focused on the party's policies than individual controversies. He also notes that the party has been gaining ground in recent opinion polls, and is optimistic about the party's chances in the elections.\nOriginal language: is\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 04:00 PM\nSource:[dv.is](https://www.dv.is/eyjan/2024/10/31/oddviti-samfylkingarinnar-reykjavik-sudur-dagur-hefur-komid-inn-kosningabarattuna-af-akvedinni-audmykt/)\n\n**Kristrún Frostadóttir's Conditional Offer to Dagur B.

However, she offered him a seat on the party's list, but with the condition that he would not be a candidate for the position of prime minister. Kristrún emphasized that Dagur would be an 'auxiliary player' and 'in a supporting role'. She also stated that if Dagur was on the list, she would not be satisfied with his presence and would rather strike him out. The article suggests that Kristrún's actions are motivated by a desire to distance herself from Dagur's past as mayor, citing issues with the management of Reykjavik, poor services to residents, and questionable financial decisions. The article concludes that Kristrún's actions are a clear indication of her party's stance on Dagur's candidacy and that she is trying to downplay the negative impact of his presence on the party's chances of winning.\nOriginal language: is\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 09:00 AM\nSource:[dv.is](https://www.dv.is/frettir/2024/10/28/segir-ad-ekki-adur-hafi-nokkur-verid-nidurlaegdur-vid-val-lista-eins-og-dagur/)\n\n**Social Democratic Alliance's Leader Makes Serious Mistakes in Election Campaign**\nThe leader of the Social Democratic Alliance, Kristrún Frostadóttir, has made three serious mistakes in the election campaign, according to the article. The party may lose the lead it has had in opinion polls for over a year due to the leader's mistakes. Many believe that Kristrún's lack of experience in politics is now showing, and she seems to be struggling in the upcoming elections. The article also criticizes Kristrún's handling of the party's list in Reykjavík, where she has been promoting Degi B. Eggertsson, a former mayor, over other candidates. The article suggests that Kristrún is afraid of being overshadowed by Eggertsson, who is a strong candidate for the party. Additionally, the article criticizes the party's decision to put Þórði Snæ Júlíusson, who was recently fired from the Ministry of Justice, and Víðir Reynisson in the top spots on the party's list in South Iceland. The article concludes that the Social Democratic Alliance and the Independence Party have made serious mistakes in their list choices, and that the Centre Party may become the largest party in the upcoming elections.\nOriginal language: is\nPublish date: October 27, 2024 02:00 PM\nSource:[dv.is](https://www.dv.is/eyjan/2024/10/27/ordid-gotunni-kludur-byrjad-hja-samfylkingu-og-sjalfstaedisflokki-verdur-midflokkurinn-staerstur/)\n\n**Social Democratic Alliance Announces List for Northwestern Constituency**\nArna Lára Jónsdóttir, the mayor of Ísafjarðarbær and a member of the Social Democratic Alliance, will lead the party's list in the Northwestern constituency for the upcoming parliamentary elections.

'I'm just coming to send a love message to Össur Skarphéðinsson and his friends in the Social Democratic Alliance,' she said in a video posted on her Facebook page today. 'It's really comical to see their true nature come out with their mudslinging, ill-mannered behavior, and things that have no basis in reality.' Össur has since withdrawn his accusations, saying that Inga is an authoritarian leader and that her behavior is unacceptable in the 21st century. He also criticized her for removing Jakob Frímann Magnússon and Tómas A. Tómasson from the party's leadership in the run-up to the parliamentary elections. 'Inga Sæland talks about a lack of democracy – most recently when the government was being formed – but at the same time, she takes authoritarian control of the People's Party, breaks its rules and laws, and excludes members from the party list if they don't dance to her tune,' Össur said. 'Össur Skarphéðinsson is not a party official. He knows nothing about the internal work of the People's Party. He knows nothing about how democratic and beautiful our party is, how great our election machine is, and how we hold everything together in our struggle.

The platform emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and expertise, with Alma and Víðir, the party's candidates, advocating for a more specialized approach to governance. However, this approach has been met with skepticism, as experts are increasingly seen as being more driven by ideology than scientific evidence. The Centre Party has historically been the bastion of liberal politics in Iceland, and its growth in recent years has been fueled by dissatisfaction among conservative voters who have expressed support for Sigmund Davíð in opinion polls. The Social Democratic Alliance's platform is more focused on social issues, such as climate change and LGBTQ+ rights, than on economic issues, which is a departure from the traditional focus of the Centre Party. Kristrún, the party leader, has stated that the Social Democratic Alliance will not take a hardline stance against the current right-wing government, but rather will seek to work with them after the elections. However, this approach may ultimately lead to the Social Democratic Alliance losing support to the Centre Party and the Left-Green Movement.\nOriginal language: is\nPublish date: October 20, 2024 10:09 PM\nSource:[utvarpsaga.is](https://utvarpsaga.is/alma-vidir-og-borgaraleg-samfylking/)\n\n**Social Democratic Alliance Calls for Candidates to Join Their List**\nThe Social Democratic Alliance (Samfylkingarinnar) is calling for candidates to join their list.

The opposition Social Democrats are currently leading the polls, indicating a potential shift in power. The election needs to take place no later than 45 days after the parliament has been dissolved. The coalition's first term culminated in the Covid-19 pandemic, but since then, tensions have been building over immigration policy, power generation, and fisheries. Asylum policy has been a particularly contentious issue, with the Independence Party wanting to take a tighter stance and the Left Greens intervening in a deportation case. The environmental movement is also opposed to the Independence Party's plans to build more power generation.

His party was on the verge of falling from parliament after the Klausturmálið scandal, but is now gaining momentum in the polls. Sigmundur Davíð was unexpectedly elected as the leader of the Progressive Party in January 2009, and initially defended the minority government of the Social Democratic Alliance and the Left-Green Movement. However, he became one of the strongest opponents of the government of these parties after the elections. His party's support continued to grow, and after the 2013 elections, he became the Prime Minister in a coalition government with the Independence Party. After the Panama Papers scandal, he resigned from office, left the Progressive Party, and founded the Centre Party a year later. The party performed well in the elections, winning 10.9% of the vote and seven seats in parliament. However, the party lost half of its support in the 2018 elections after the Klausturmálið scandal, which had a significant impact on the party's position. Two members of the People's Party later joined the Centre Party, but it was not enough. The party received only 5.4% in the 2021 elections and was on the verge of falling from parliament. However, the party has now gained momentum and is consistently ranked as the second-largest party in the country. According to the latest Gallup poll, the Centre Party has 18.7% support and would win 13 seats in parliament. Sigmundur Davíð said, 'It is a great day.' The Centre Party could potentially form a two-party government with the Social Democratic Alliance, and Gallup also calculated the number of seats the party would win in a coalition government with the Alliance. Sigmundur Davíð will be interviewed in a live broadcast on Vísi and Stöð 2-Vísi at 14:00, which will be broadcast again on Stöð 2 at 19:05.\nOriginal language: is\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 10:05 AM\nSource:[visir.is](https://www.visir.is/g/20242632832d/lukkuriddari-kannana-maetir-i-sam-talid)\n\n**Government Support Hits Record Low in Iceland**\nA recent Gallup survey in Iceland has revealed a record low in government support, with the Social Democratic Alliance polling at 26% and the Independence Party at 14%, its lowest level ever.

The program will also be broadcast on Stöð 2 at 19:10 tonight. The program is a new national language program that will be on the schedule every Friday in the winter. Many questions are being asked of Bjarni Benediktsson, who has been the leader of the Independence Party for the longest period of time, 15 years. He leads a government that has been controversial since the start of the previous government of the Left-Green Party, Independence Party, and Progressive Party. Growing dissatisfaction has been felt in the government coalition since it was renewed after the 2021 elections, with some saying that the government cannot maintain its position with the dissatisfaction that reigns within it. Support for the government has decreased significantly, and according to polls, it is on the verge of collapse. The support for the Independence Party has also decreased, with the party's support now at 14%. Many controversial issues are waiting to be addressed in the Althing this last parliamentary session before the elections, with 217 government bills on the agenda. It appears that within the government, there will be a discussion about energy and power issues, foreigner issues, and issues related to the constitution in the country. According to the electoral law, the next parliamentary elections should take place in September next year. Elections were held in the autumn of 2016 after Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson resigned as Prime Minister before the end of the term and the elections, and in the autumn of 2017 after the government of Bjarni Benediktsson collapsed after only ten months. The current coalition parties, which formed a government after the 2017 elections, decided to serve out the term, so that for the third time in a row, elections were held in the autumn of 2021. Now, many are wondering whether the coalition parties will call for elections next spring, as it has been a tradition for parliamentary elections to take place in the spring. This question and many others will be discussed in the live broadcast of Samtalið on Vísir and Stöð 2/Vísir at 14:00 today.\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: September 19, 2024 10:21 AM\nSource:[Vísir.is](https://www.visir.is/g/20242623335d/forsaetisradherra-maetir-fyrstur-manna-i-samtalid)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The Progressive Party comes in third with 17%, followed by the Reform Party with 11% and the Liberal Party with 10%. The Pirate Party and the People's Party received 6% each, the Socialist Party 5%, and the Left-Green Party 3%. The survey also shows that the support for these parties is relatively stable, with the Independence Party and the Social Democratic Alliance consistently being the largest parties. The Progressive Party's support is increasing, while the Reform Party's support is stable. The Liberal Party's support is also stable, but with a slight decrease.

Ideally, the Progressive Party and the Independence Party would share the tasks of the Green Party's ministers.

'It would have no purpose to bring in new people. This is primarily a government that is working until the elections,' Sigurður said. Svandís previously stated that she was willing to sit in a minority government under the leadership of Sigurður Ingi until the elections. 'No, not personally. But what we found in the Progressive Party and what we find now is that we need to look at these tasks that we consider important to be completed.

Svandís Svavarsdóttir, chairman of the Left-Green Movement, said that it would be most important for Bjarni to submit a resignation and that she could imagine a caretaker government with Sigurður Ingi as Prime Minister. Össur says that according to his own statement, Bjarni was supposed to meet with the President to submit a resignation for his government. Össur believes that Sigurður Ingi will end his term as Prime Minister. 'So the story repeats itself. When men set up a play, they must think of the end. It did not happen in 2016, and it will not happen in 2024,' Össur says in the end.\nOriginal language: is\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 08:15 PM\nSource:[mbl.is](https://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2024/10/14/ossur_segir_soguna_munu_endurtaka_sig/)\n\n**Icelandic Government Coalition Collapses, Early Elections Called**\nIcelandic Prime Minister Bjarne Benediktsson announced the collapse of the governing coalition and called for early elections on November 30.

The program will also be broadcast on Stöð 2 at 19:10 tonight. The program is a new national language program that will be on the schedule every Friday in the winter. Many questions are being asked of Bjarni Benediktsson, who has been the leader of the Independence Party for the longest period of time, 15 years. He leads a government that has been controversial since the start of the previous government of the Left-Green Party, Independence Party, and Progressive Party. Growing dissatisfaction has been felt in the government coalition since it was renewed after the 2021 elections, with some saying that the government cannot maintain its position with the dissatisfaction that reigns within it. Support for the government has decreased significantly, and according to polls, it is on the verge of collapse. The support for the Independence Party has also decreased, with the party's support now at 14%. Many controversial issues are waiting to be addressed in the Althing this last parliamentary session before the elections, with 217 government bills on the agenda. It appears that within the government, there will be a discussion about energy and power issues, foreigner issues, and issues related to the constitution in the country. According to the electoral law, the next parliamentary elections should take place in September next year. Elections were held in the autumn of 2016 after Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson resigned as Prime Minister before the end of the term and the elections, and in the autumn of 2017 after the government of Bjarni Benediktsson collapsed after only ten months. The current coalition parties, which formed a government after the 2017 elections, decided to serve out the term, so that for the third time in a row, elections were held in the autumn of 2021. Now, many are wondering whether the coalition parties will call for elections next spring, as it has been a tradition for parliamentary elections to take place in the spring. This question and many others will be discussed in the live broadcast of Samtalið on Vísir and Stöð 2/Vísir at 14:00 today.\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: September 19, 2024 10:21 AM\nSource:[Vísir.is](https://www.visir.is/g/20242623335d/forsaetisradherra-maetir-fyrstur-manna-i-samtalid)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The National Broadcasting Service RUV reported that elections should take place no later than 45 days after the parliament's dissolution. Benediktsson is set to meet with Tomasdottir on Monday. The coalition government consists of Benediktsson's conservative Independence Party, the centrist Progressive Party, and the left-wing 'green' party. Svandis Svavarsson, Minister of Infrastructure and leader of the 'green' party, said that the decision to dissolve the parliament was unexpected and not discussed during her meeting with Benediktsson on Saturday. 'I thought we were meeting honestly, discussing the situation, and possibly returning to look at specific issues. I thought we understood that the most important issues were the economy, housing, and the problems faced by ordinary people who are struggling to make ends meet. I thought this was our most pressing issue, but now we see that for the Prime Minister, other issues are more important,' she said.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 07:35 AM\nSource:[euronews](https://ru.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/10/14/iceland-parliament-dissolution)\n\n**Iceland's Ruling Coalition Collapses, New Elections Proposed**\nThe ruling coalition in Iceland has collapsed since November 2021, composed of left-wing and right-wing parties due to political disagreements, as announced by Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson on Sunday, proposing new elections in November next month.

Many questions are being asked of Bjarni Benediktsson, who has been the leader of the Independence Party for the longest period of time, 15 years. He leads a government that has been controversial since the start of the previous government of the Left-Green Party, Independence Party, and Progressive Party. Growing dissatisfaction has been felt in the government coalition since it was renewed after the 2021 elections, with some saying that the government cannot maintain its position with the dissatisfaction that reigns within it. Support for the government has decreased significantly, and according to polls, it is on the verge of collapse. The support for the Independence Party has also decreased, with the party's support now at 14%. Many controversial issues are waiting to be addressed in the Althing this last parliamentary session before the elections, with 217 government bills on the agenda. It appears that within the government, there will be a discussion about energy and power issues, foreigner issues, and issues related to the constitution in the country. According to the electoral law, the next parliamentary elections should take place in September next year. Elections were held in the autumn of 2016 after Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson resigned as Prime Minister before the end of the term and the elections, and in the autumn of 2017 after the government of Bjarni Benediktsson collapsed after only ten months. The current coalition parties, which formed a government after the 2017 elections, decided to serve out the term, so that for the third time in a row, elections were held in the autumn of 2021. Now, many are wondering whether the coalition parties will call for elections next spring, as it has been a tradition for parliamentary elections to take place in the spring. This question and many others will be discussed in the live broadcast of Samtalið on Vísir and Stöð 2/Vísir at 14:00 today.\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: September 19, 2024 10:21 AM\nSource:[Vísir.is](https://www.visir.is/g/20242623335d/forsaetisradherra-maetir-fyrstur-manna-i-samtalid)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

He has deployed thousands of soldiers for this purpose. Russian and North Korean forces are preparing for an attack in the Kursk region, which is seen as a threat to Ukraine. Western diplomats are concerned about the rapid seizure of territories by Russia before Trump's inauguration. Ukrainian and American officials expect an attack in the Kursk region and the involvement of North Korean troops. According to estimates by NATO allies, Putin aims to regain control over territories lost during Ukraine's advance by January 20. British military intelligence predicts that Russia will intensify drone attacks on Ukrainian positions, including from new launch sites near the border. Approximately 12,000 North Korean conscripts are expected to join the fighting in the Kursk region under a military support agreement between Russia and North Korea, signed this year. Ukrainian analysts believe that the Kremlin may try to use this massive counterattack in the Kursk region to further advance into the northeastern Sumy region of Ukraine. Currently, Russia has regained control over about half of the territory previously occupied by Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region. The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, General Alexander Syrskyi, reported that Ukrainian positions are being attacked by 'tens of thousands of enemy soldiers from the most powerful Russian assault units.' Western diplomats are concerned that Putin will try to quickly seize territories before Trump's inauguration to strengthen Russia's position in potential peace talks.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 08:25 AM\nSource:[online.ua](https://news.online.ua/putin-pospisaje-povernuti-teritoriyi-na-kurshhini-do-inavguraciyi-trampa-887135/)\n\n**Russia Expands Military Offensive on Ukraine Border**\nRussia has intensified its military operations to retake the western region of Kursk, on the border with Ukraine, according to Ukrainian army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, on Monday (11 Nov 2024). This move comes a day after the New York Times reported on the mobilization of 50,000 Russian soldiers, including North Korean troops, for an attack on the border. The NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) had already confirmed in October the presence of North Korean soldiers in the conflict. Russia, however, has not confirmed these reports. On November 2, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reaffirmed their bilateral commitment to implement agreements on military assistance between the two countries. They met in Moscow. Ukraine's incursion into Kursk in August 2022 marked a significant offensive in Russian territory in response to the Russian invasion six months earlier. Russia, in turn, advanced slowly in eastern Ukraine, capturing villages in the Donbass region. Russian President Vladimir Putin promised retaliation against Ukraine for the invasion of Kursk, near the border between the two countries. Kiev controlled an area of over 1,000 km² in Kursk.

As the conflict has dragged on, its international repercussions have expanded, with more countries becoming involved, directly or indirectly. Ukraine has received military and financial aid from multiple European countries, while Russia has strengthened its ties with North Korea, which has sent soldiers to be trained by the Russian military. The diplomatic landscape is also clear-cut, with Western countries viewing any country that does not support Ukraine or sanction Russia as 'friendly' with Putin. However, no international position is powerful enough to impose a ceasefire. Many countries have committed to playing mediator roles, such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, due to their multiple interests in the conflict.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 10, 2024 03:30 PM\nSource:[escenariomundial.com](https://www.escenariomundial.com/2024/11/10/como-la-guerra-en-ucrania-se-transformo-en-un-conflicto-global/)\n\n**Trump and Ukraine: what Russia wants, what Trump could do**\nRussia's objectives in Ukraine include keeping the territories it has annexed, demanding formal recognition of these annexations, and establishing firm borders.

Additionally, Russia will demand that Ukraine be largely demilitarized, that NATO get out of Ukraine, and that all sanctions be lifted.

This is the largest monthly territorial gain since March 2022. The recent advances have surpassed those of August and September, which had already marked significant changes in the front line, with territories gained of 477 km² and 459 km², respectively. Much of these conquests have focused on the Donetsk region, a critical area for logistics and territorial control, where Russian forces have secured approximately 324 km² in October. This illustrates the serious difficulties faced by Ukrainian forces, which are struggling to resist a Russian army with more personnel and better equipment. Since the start of the war in February 2022, Russia has accumulated around 67,192 km² of Ukrainian territory, including the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and previously controlled Donbás territories. In total, Moscow controls approximately 18.2% of Ukraine's total territory. Meanwhile, Russia has intensified its deterrence rhetoric by conducting strategic nuclear exercises under the direct supervision of President Vladimir Putin. These maneuvers, which include ballistic and cruise missile tests, as well as land, sea, and air strategic force simulations, send a direct message about Russia's military power and its willingness to consider extreme measures in the conflict.

Markov made this estimate after calculating the pace of Russian forces taking control of the territories and accounting for the remaining Ukrainian-controlled lands. He also considered the geometric progression of the Russian advance. According to Markov, 'We need not only arithmetic progression, that is, linear speed of advance. But also geometric progression, that is, the speed of advance and acceleration of advance.

The majority of these gains, two-thirds, were made in the Donetsk region. The Russian army has advanced 478 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory since the start of October, surpassing the 477 and 459 square kilometers gained in August and September, respectively. The Ukrainian army is in a disadvantageous position due to the numerical superiority of the Russian army. The last time Russian forces made such significant gains was in March 2022, when they advanced towards Kyiv. The total area occupied by Russia since the start of 2024 is 2,660 square kilometers, bringing the total area under their control to 18.2% of Ukraine's territory, including Crimea, which was annexed in 2014, and the Donbas regions, which were already under separatist control. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces confirmed that the situation in the Donetsk region is tense, with 149 battles reported in the past day, including 31 attacks repelled by Ukrainian defenders on the Pokrovsky direction.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 11:38 AM\nSource:[ФОКУС](https://focus.ua/uk/voennye-novosti/675800-viyna-v-ukrajini-naskilki-prosunulisya-rosiyski-viyska)\n\n**Russia's alleged plan to take control of Ukrainian territory**\nA recent article by the German newspaper Bild claims that Russia plans to take control of a significant portion of Ukrainian territory, including major industrial cities, within the next two years. According to the article, the plan involves the 'deindustrialization' of Ukraine by seizing its industrial base, including the 'metallic-coal belt' of eastern Ukraine. The article cites German intelligence sources, who claim that Russia aims to take control of the Dnepropetrovsk and Zaporozhye regions, as well as the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, by the end of 2025. The article notes that this plan is consistent with Ukraine's historical goal of building a 'great agrarian empire', but argues that this is not a viable economic strategy. The article also notes that Ukraine's metal and coal industry has been a key factor in the country's economy, and that the loss of these industries would have significant consequences for Ukraine's economy. The article concludes that the German intelligence sources' claims are plausible, but that it is unclear whether Russia actually plans to implement this strategy.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 05:04 AM\nSource:[РИА Новости](https://ria.ru/20241029/rossiya-1980579474.html)\n\n**Russia Sets New Record in Special Operation Zone**\nRussian forces have advanced 478 square kilometers in October in the special operation zone, setting a record since 2022.

Russian forces are now just kilometers away from the city, approaching from the south and east. Since months, Ukraine has been losing territory in eastern Ukraine to Russian forces, who are more numerous and better equipped, despite suffering heavy losses. In October, Russia captured more than 40 square kilometers near the city of Kupyansk, which it had occupied at the beginning of the war and then lost to Ukraine in September 2022. Russian forces have made similar territorial gains in March 2022, when they expanded their operations northward towards Kyiv.

According to the Center for National Resistance, starting from January 1, 2025, Ukrainian citizens who do not obtain a Russian passport will lose their right to social benefits. The occupation authorities are openly applying pressure, warning the most vulnerable categories of population that they will be deprived of necessary assistance. This creates a real threat to the lives of many patients, as humanitarian aid to occupied territories remains limited. The Kremlin has announced its intention to complete mass passportization of all occupied territories by the end of 2024, but this process is facing significant challenges due to passive resistance from the population and failures by local collaborators. The occupation authorities are intensifying pressure on residents, threatening to deprive them not only of access to medicines, but also of social payments, pensions, medical services, and benefits. In this way, the enemy is using blackmail as a tool of coercion, trying to create the illusion of 'voluntary' acceptance of Russian citizenship. This approach shows that the occupying power is not interested in the well-being of the population, but rather seeks to strengthen its control over the occupied territories. The revocation of the right to social benefits has become a weapon in the hands of the occupiers, aimed at the most vulnerable segments of the population, leaving them with minimal chances of survival without integration into the Russian system. As said by the Center for National Resistance, 'This is a clear example of the occupiers' disregard for the lives and well-being of the Ukrainian people.'\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 27, 2024 06:31 PM\nSource:[vchaspik.ua](https://vchaspik.ua/ua/regiony/577181-tysk-na-vrazlyvi-verstvy-naselennya-okupanty-shantazhuyut-ukrayinciv-skasuvannyam)\n\n**Belarusian Border Fully Controlled, Intelligence Units Monitor Situation**\nThe border with Belarus is fully controlled, with all intelligence units actively monitoring the situation.

Ukraine denies any policy of oppression against ethnically Russian or Russian-speaking people, who continue to be the native language of many Ukrainians.

Sberbank operates 48 branches and 130 ATMs in these regions, with plans for further expansion. VTB Bank also plans to open branches in Mariupol before the end of the year. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia has led to the control of four regions: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. Although Russia does not fully control these territories, it continues to make efforts to capture more. PSB Bank was the first to establish a significant presence, with almost 400 locations in Donetsk and Luhansk. The operations of the banks are part of a broader strategy to integrate these regions into the Russian economy. Schools are reviewing their textbooks, and even banks like Sberbank have opened an office in Crimea, despite suspending their activities there in 2014. President Putin encourages companies to operate in these regions, minimizing the risks of sanctions. However, many companies are hesitant due to low purchasing power and high risk. A source from the retail sector told the 'Financial Times' that sensible companies would not go there. Even in Crimea, few companies are active. Western sanctions are likely to deter companies from operating in these regions. Despite economic challenges, Russian companies can still position themselves as 'patriotic companies' by operating in occupied territories. The Black Star Burger restaurant chain, for example, plans to open branches in Mariupol and Kherson. Last year, it was reported that around 2,500 companies were active in the new territories, although some may have been confiscated by Russia. High Risk, Low Reward The occupation of Ukrainian territories presents businesses with high risks and few rewards. Companies are reluctant to invest due to the volatile political environment and low purchasing power. Protests and violence in these regions often disrupt operations, making them unattractive to foreign investors. However, Russian banks see an opportunity to expand their presence in these regions and strengthen their control over the local economy. They can offer loans and financial services to local companies, creating a dependence on Russian banks. But the long-term sustainability of these companies under international sanctions and economic instability remains uncertain. In recent years, Russia has made efforts to integrate these territories into its economy. This includes reviewing school textbooks and encouraging companies to operate in the region. Despite challenges, many Russian companies are willing to take the risk, considering it a way to demonstrate their patriotism. However, the political and economic situation in these regions remains unstable and volatile. The long-term impact of the occupation on Ukraine's economy and international relations is still to be seen. Companies operating in these regions will have to navigate the complex political landscape and adapt to changing circumstances to survive and thrive.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 16, 2024 01:53 PM\nSource:[Zeitung \"Aussiedlerbote\" / Газета \"Переселенческий Вестник\"](https://aussiedlerbote.de/es/se-aseguro-de-que-el-equipo-con-cajeros-automaticos-fue-consolidado-por-putin)\n\n**Russia Strengthens Control Over Occupied Ukrainian Territories**\nRussia is strengthening its control over the occupied Ukrainian territories by opening branches of its largest state-owned banks, such as 'Sberbank' and 'VTB', despite Western sanctions. President Putin is encouraging Russian companies to operate in the occupied territories, stating that the sanctions have already occurred and there is nothing to be afraid of. The Central Bank of Russia has extended the limit on foreign cash withdrawals until March 2025, with a limit of $10,000, amidst restrictions on dollar and euro transfers. According to a report by the British Financial Times, Russia is working to consolidate its grip on the territories it has recently occupied in Ukraine, by opening branches of its largest state-owned banks in cities such as Mariupol. While many brands are still avoiding these areas due to fear of Western sanctions and the risks of doing business in a war zone, the largest Russian state-owned banks, such as 'Sberbank' and 'VTB', have begun to respond to this call. Sources within Sberbank, which was subject to Western sanctions in 2022, told the Financial Times that it has opened 130 automated cash machines and 48 locations in what Moscow describes as 'new areas' in eastern and southern Ukraine, including opening full branches of some Russian banks. Sberbank has already served nearly 70,000 people and plans to expand its operations there. President Putin told state-owned companies this year that 'there is nothing to be afraid of' when establishing stores and branches in the occupied territories. Putin told financial leaders: 'You must start going to these areas with greater enthusiasm and start working there... everything you were afraid of has already happened. So what should we be afraid of?' Moscow has announced that the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine are part of Russia constitutionally after being occupied by force. However, Russian forces do not fully control all the territory they claim, and they continue to try to capture more areas recognized internationally as Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraine launched a surprise attack on the Russian region of Kursk last month, capturing large areas of land, as both sides seek to maximize their territorial gains before entering any peace talks.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 15, 2024 04:03 PM\nSource:[العربي الجديد](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/economy/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D9%88%D9%83-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%83%D9%81-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AD-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B9-%D9%84%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82-%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The report notes that increased US oil production through aggressive drilling policies could lead to shifts in global supply dynamics, influenced by factors such as Middle East tensions, sanctions on countries like Iran, and trade tensions. The report also mentions that trade uncertainty and frictions remain a headwind to crude prices, and that a resurgence of sanctions on Iran could lead to a potential loss of supply from the oil market. Currently, market prices stand at $70 for WTI Crude, $74 for Brent, and Rs 6,024 for MCX November Futures. The report suggests that the Trump regime may bring comfort to the oil industry by investing in pipeline infrastructure, thereby increasing crude oil output.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 09:53 AM\nSource:[theshillongtimes.com](https://theshillongtimes.com/2024/11/11/us-oil-drilling-costs-may-reach-67-70-per-barrel-by-2026-under-trump/)\n\n**US Oil Production: Standard Chartered Says Growth Will Slow Down Under Trump**\nStandard Chartered has stated that the US oil production, particularly shale oil, has changed significantly since Donald Trump took office in 2017. The bank notes that US oil production reached a record high of 13.40 million barrels per day (mb/d) in August 2024, surpassing the previous record of 3.31 mb/d set in December 2023. However, the growth rate has slowed down, with a 0.4 mb/d increase over the pre-pandemic level of November 2019, equivalent to an annual growth rate of just 80,000 barrels per day (kb/d). StanChart predicts that the growth rate will continue to slow down in 2024 and 2025. The bank also notes that the dynamics of US shale oil production make it difficult to maintain long-term increases in supply, as the industry is dominated by major companies, independent producers, and private companies, rather than a national oil company like those in OPEC. These companies have largely moved away from easy drilling and have adopted a strict capital discipline, prioritizing dividend payments and share buybacks over rapid production increases. StanChart also highlights the significant activity in mergers and acquisitions in the sector, which has reduced the number of operating companies and transformed the landscape from a mosaic of small production areas to larger contiguous areas. This new approach enables complex drilling and completion techniques, including multi-pad wells with extremely long lateral sections that can optimize spacing and associated infrastructure. These efficiency gains in drilling and completion have allowed production to continue growing despite the decline in the number of drilling rigs. Goldman Sachs has also predicted that US oil production will increase by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, a slower growth rate than the over 1 million bpd increase seen last year. However, the US will account for 60% of non-OPEC production growth, with the Permian expected to grow by 340,000 bpd, down from Goldman's initial-year forecast of 520,000 bpd. According to GS, technological and efficiency gains have accounted for almost all the growth in the Texas and New Mexico shale since 2020; however, the bank has warned that 'the Permian is maturing and its deteriorating geology will weigh on oil production in the future.' The number of drilling rigs in the Permian has fallen by nearly 15% from its peak in April last year, standing at 309 and is down 30% from the 2018-2019 average, Goldman Sachs has revealed. GS has predicted that the number of drilling rigs in the Permian will be below 300 by the end of 2025. StanChart has also highlighted that shale oil has a different production profile than conventional oil, with production ramping up quickly but then declining rapidly, often within a couple of months. The decline rate is determined by various factors, including the characteristics of the reservoir, completion techniques, and extraction practices, but can be as high as 80%. These high decline rates and short production profiles mean that new production must be brought online continuously, the so-called 'Red Queen effect.' If managed effectively, StanChart has predicted that the US supply will stabilize at current prices. However, high tariffs imposed by Trump in 2018 on some steel imports and aluminum have discouraged large increases in production. The steel used in all phases of drilling and production, including treated steel for drilling equipment, pumps, pipes, and conduits, has become a significant cost pressure for US oil producers, as cited in various recent industry surveys. Finally, it is likely that Trump will open federal lands to exploration and production. However, StanChart has noted that the times required for license release, exploration, evaluation, and potential production are multi-year, meaning that any production from federal lands will likely occur after the end of his four-year term.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[scenarieconomici.it](https://scenarieconomici.it/produzione-di-petrolio-usa-secondo-standard-chart-non-crescera-di-molto-sotto-trump/)\n\n**US Oil Drilling Rigs Remain Unchanged**\nAccording to Baker Hughes' weekly data, the number of oil drilling rigs in the US remained unchanged at 479 from November 2-8.

The report notes that increased US oil production through aggressive drilling policies could lead to shifts in global supply dynamics, influenced by factors such as Middle East tensions, sanctions on countries like Iran, and trade tensions. The report also mentions that trade uncertainty and frictions remain a headwind to crude prices, and that a resurgence of sanctions on Iran could lead to a potential loss of supply from the oil market. Currently, market prices stand at $70 for WTI Crude, $74 for Brent, and Rs 6,024 for MCX November Futures. The report suggests that the Trump regime may bring comfort to the oil industry by investing in pipeline infrastructure, thereby increasing crude oil output.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 09:53 AM\nSource:[theshillongtimes.com](https://theshillongtimes.com/2024/11/11/us-oil-drilling-costs-may-reach-67-70-per-barrel-by-2026-under-trump/)\n\n**US Oil Drilling Rigs Remain Unchanged**\nAccording to Baker Hughes' weekly data, the number of oil drilling rigs in the US remained unchanged at 479 from November 2-8.
