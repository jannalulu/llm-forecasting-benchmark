**First Human Case of Avian Influenza H5N1 in the US: A Child from California**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed a human infection with the avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, also known as bird flu, in a child from California, USA. The child reportedly experienced mild symptoms and received antiviral treatment for the flu. According to the CDC, 'In line with previously identified human cases in the US, the child apparently experienced mild symptoms and received antivirals against the flu.' The initial sample collected showed low levels of viral material, and follow-up tests on the child several days later were negative for avian flu H5 but positive for common respiratory viruses. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is conducting a study to determine the possible cause of the child's exposure to H5N1. The child is recovering, and the study found that all household members reported symptoms and were tested, with all results negative for avian flu H5 and several family members positive for the same common respiratory viruses. Contact tracing is ongoing, but there is currently no evidence of person-to-person transmission of H5N1 from the child to others. The CDC is closely monitoring data from flu surveillance systems, particularly in states affected by animal outbreaks, such as California, where there have been widespread outbreaks of avian flu H5N1 in wild and domestic birds since 2022 and in cattle since August 2024. The CDC confirmed that sporadic and limited human infections with the H5N1 virus, where no animal exposure was detected, are rare and sporadic.

**CDC Confirms First Case of H5N1 Bird Flu in a Child in California; Will the Infection Spread to the General Public?**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed the first case of H5N1 bird flu in a child in California. Despite having no known contact with infected animals, the child tested positive for the flu. The CDC has stated that the risk of the virus spreading to the general public is low, and no evidence of person-to-person transmission has been found. The child's household members who showed symptoms were tested, but all came back negative for bird flu. However, some family members tested positive for the same respiratory virus as the child. As of last week, there have been 55 human cases of H5N1 avian flu in the US, with 29 reported in California. So far, all cases have been mild and patients have recovered after taking antiviral medication.

**CDC A(H5N1) Bird Flu Response Update November 18, 2024**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to respond to the multistate outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in the United States. Since April 2024, CDC has confirmed 52 human cases of H5N1 bird flu, with 21 cases associated with exposure to infected poultry and 30 cases associated with exposure to infected dairy cows. The source of exposure in one case could not be determined. All recent cases have occurred in workers on affected farms, with mild symptoms such as eye redness or discharge. CDC believes the immediate risk to the general public from H5 bird flu remains low, but people with exposure to infected animals are at higher risk of infection. The CDC recommends oseltamivir for treatment of patients with H5N1 and for post-exposure prophylaxis of close contacts of confirmed H5N1 patients. Influenza genetic sequence data from recent cases have been posted in GISAID and GenBank. CDC continues to support states in monitoring people with exposure to infected animals and has tested over 7,300 people as a result of their exposure. More than 60,000 specimens have been tested for avian influenza A(H5) virus or other novel influenza viruses at public health labs.

**US Reports First Case of Child Infected with H5N1 Bird Flu Virus**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported the first case of a child infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus. The case was detected in California, and experts are investigating how the child contracted the infection. According to the CDC, the child had mild symptoms and was receiving antiviral medication. The child's family members reported symptoms and underwent testing, with all members except the child testing negative for the H5N1 virus. However, some family members tested positive for other common respiratory viruses. The CDC stated that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus. Since April 2024, 52 cases of human infection have been confirmed, with 21 cases attributed to contact with infected birds, 30 cases attributed to contact with infected cattle, and the cause of infection unknown in one case. The CDC also reported that there have been no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus. Additionally, the US Department of Agriculture has confirmed the infection of over 25 million birds and 505 dairy farms in 15 states since March 2024. The CDC recommends maintaining a safe distance from infected animals, drinking pasteurized milk, avoiding raw eggs, and avoiding contact with animal feces and materials that may have come into contact with infected animals. The main symptoms of the H5N1 virus appear quickly, within 3-5 days, and include high fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, cough, and shortness of breath.

**Avian Influenza in a Child: A Warning from Dr. Matteo Bassetti**
A child in the United States has tested positive for the H5N1 avian influenza virus for the first time. The child, who lives in Alameda County near San Francisco Bay, has mild symptoms and is receiving antiviral treatment at home, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and California health authorities. The child had a low level of the virus, indicating it was likely not infectious when detected. The child tested negative four days after the initial positive result. Dr. Matteo Bassetti, an infectious disease specialist at San Martino Hospital in Genoa, notes that the child likely contracted the virus from a bird, unlike previous cases in the US this year, which were mostly among poultry farmers. Bassetti warns that the virus is changing and mutating, and that the 55 cases in the US this year make it the largest H5N1 epidemic since it was first described in Hong Kong in 1997. 'This virus has passed through a variety of animals, including mammals, and is getting closer to humans,' Bassetti says. 'The next step will be human-to-human transmission, which will happen sooner or later.' Bassetti emphasizes the need for vigilance and notes that the virus is now closer to humans than it was a year ago. 'We must not underestimate the risk of a pandemic,' he says. 'The numbers are real, 55 cases in 2024, and it's not just a matter of time before we see a pandemic.'

**US Reports First Case of Avian Flu in a Child**
US health authorities reported a case of avian flu in a child living in California, marking the first recorded case of a minor in the country. The child, whose age was not disclosed, is recovering from the illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) investigated the possible source of the child's exposure to H5N1, but it has not been identified yet. The child's family members reported symptoms, so samples were collected from each of them, which tested negative for avian flu. 'Contact tracing continues, but currently, there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission of the H5N1 avian flu from this child to others,' the CDC stated in a press release. This is the second case detected through the virus surveillance program in the US. The CDC continues to closely monitor the available data, particularly in states affected by animal outbreaks, including California, where cases of avian flu H5N1 have been detected in wild birds and domestic poultry since 2022, as well as in dairy herds since August 2024. The CDC noted that limited and sporadic human infections with the H5N1 avian flu virus, where animal exposure was not identified, are rare but have occurred, mainly in countries other than the US. Including this recent case, 55 human cases of avian flu have been reported in the US in 2024, with 29 of them in California. In April, the first case of H5N1 was detected in Texas, where a farm worker tested positive after being exposed to contaminated cows. The virus, identified as H5N1, is a highly contagious subtype of avian flu among birds. The CDC stated that there are no signs that this virus has evolved to spread rapidly among people.

**First US Case of Avian Influenza in Over 15 Years Detected in Child**
A case of avian influenza (H5N1) has been detected in a child in the Alameda County, near San Francisco, marking the first case in the US in over 15 years. The child, who is experiencing mild symptoms, has been treated with antiviral medication at home and is not considered contagious. The child's family members have also tested negative for the virus. As a precaution, local authorities have offered testing and preventive treatment to employees and other children at the daycare center attended by the child. Tomas Aragon, Director of Health Services in California, stated, 'It is natural that people are concerned, but we want to assure parents, employees, and families that, based on the information and data we have, we do not believe the child was contagious.' He added, 'No cases of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza have been documented in any country in over 15 years.' The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that, including this recent case, 55 human cases of avian influenza (sub-type) H5 have been reported in the US in 2024, with 29 in California.

**California Child Becomes First Pediatric Case of Avian Flu H5N1 in the US**
A child in California has become the first pediatric case of avian flu H5N1 in the United States. Although all household members were evaluated, only the child tested positive. The California Department of Public Health and the CDC are investigating the source of exposure, ruling out, for now, person-to-person transmission. The child is recovering. This case is part of the 55 human cases of avian flu H5N1 reported in 2024, with 29 cases in California. The CDC is monitoring bird outbreaks in wild, domestic, and dairy herds since 2022, with a focus on affected states like California and Texas. While human infections are rare, active surveillance aims to prevent the spread of the virus. 'The sub-type of avian flu H5N1 is highly contagious among birds, but its transmission between humans remains limited and sporadic,' said the CDC. 'There is no evidence that the virus has evolved to spread easily among people, so we are focusing on preventing future cases and reinforcing safety measures in vulnerable populations.'

**US Reports First Case of Avian Flu in a Child**
US health authorities announced a rare case of avian flu in a child in the San Francisco Bay Area, marking the first detection of the H5N1 virus in a child in the United States. The child, living in Alameda County, has mild symptoms and is receiving antiviral treatment at home. Tests showed a low level of the virus, suggesting low contagiousness. A follow-up test four days later was negative, and the child's family members were not infected. As a precaution, authorities offered tests and preventive treatments to people in contact with the child at their daycare. Dr. Tomas Aragon, California's public health director, reassured the public, stating that no human-to-human transmission of avian flu has been documented in over 15 years. This case comes in the context of an increase in H5N1 infections in various animal species since 2020, including recently in US dairy cattle. Although the public health risk is considered low, it is higher for people in professional contact with livestock. The CDC reports that this new case brings the total number of human infections with the H5 virus in the US to 55 in 2024, with 29 in California. Experts remain vigilant about the possibility of a virus mutation that could facilitate human-to-human transmission, despite the current rarity of human cases.

**First Pediatric Case of H5N1 Avian Influenza in the US**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Cdc) have confirmed a human infection with the A H5N1 virus in a child in California. The child, who experienced mild symptoms, received antiviral flu medication and is recovering. An investigation by the California Department of Public Health (Cdph) is underway to determine the possible source of the child's exposure to the H5N1 virus. The child's family members have also been tested and found to be negative for the H5N1 virus, but positive for common respiratory viruses. 'To date, no person-to-person transmission of H5N1 avian influenza has been identified in any of the cases reported in the United States,' said the Cdc. This case was detected through flu testing and reported to the California department through the national influenza surveillance system. It is the second human case identified in the US. The Cdc continues to monitor the data, particularly in states affected by animal epidemics, such as California, where widespread outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza have been detected in wild birds and domestic poultry since 2022 and in dairy herds since August 2024. 'These cases highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance and investigations at the local, state, and federal levels,' said the experts. Including this recent case, there have been 55 human cases of H5 avian influenza reported in the US in 2024, with 29 in California. The Cdc's risk assessment for the general public remains 'low.' However, people exposed to infected or potentially infected animals, such as birds, dairy cattle, or other animals, or to contaminated environments, are at higher risk of infection. The Cdc recommends avoiding unprotected exposure to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domestic birds, and other wild or domestic animals (including cows).

**US Intensifies Response to H5N1 Bird Flu Outbreak**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has intensified its response to the H5N1 bird flu outbreak, recommending that antivirals be administered to any worker who has had high-risk exposure to infected animals without proper use of protective equipment, regardless of symptoms. This is a change from the previous recommendation, which only advised antiviral treatment for people with suspected H5N1 symptoms. The CDC also recommends testing exposed workers, even if they do not show symptoms. A new CDC study found that half of the workers who tested positive for H5N1 did not remember having symptoms. The study suggests that the previous strategy of only monitoring symptoms and testing workers who reported being ill was not sufficient. 'Although we have not observed changes in the virus that suggest the ability to transmit from person to person, we want to keep this risk as low as it is now,' said Nirav Shah, CDC deputy director. 'One of the best ways to do this is to identify more exposed individuals through additional testing and provide them with Tamiflu to reduce the virus levels in their bodies.' The intensified response comes as signs suggest that the virus is spreading out of control in the US, with cases among humans and farm animals increasing rapidly. According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), 151 of the 446 confirmed dairy farm infections this year were confirmed in the last 30 days. The number of confirmed human cases rose to 46 on Thursday, up from 31 on October 24. 'In any outbreak situation, we know that there are individuals who may have been exposed, may have been infected, and are not part of the count,' Shah said. 'These data really help us understand that some of those workers may have had symptoms so mild that they don't remember being sick.' In addition to the new testing and antiviral recommendations, the CDC is also updating its equipment protection guidelines. The CDC believes that H5N1 still represents a low risk to the general public, although the number of human cases is growing. Almost all cases have been mild, with more than half occurring in workers exposed to infected cattle, and almost all others in workers exposed to infected birds. In late October, the USDA revealed that a pig on a domestic farm in Oregon tested positive for H5N1, the first known case in a pig in the US. Experts have long been concerned about the entry of H5N1 into the pig population, because bird flu viruses adapted to infect birds and humans can infect pigs and recombine in these animals to create new, more dangerous germs. This process is believed to be responsible for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The USDA reported on Wednesday that a second pig on the same farm also tested positive for H5N1. The agency said that the pigs were infected with a strain of H5N1 found in wild birds, not the strain circulating among dairy cattle, and that the animals on that farm likely became infected through migratory birds.

**Bird flu could become deadlier if it mixes with seasonal flu viruses, experts warn**
The H5N1 bird flu virus has been spreading in the US, with 36 human cases reported across 17 states since April 2024. While the virus has been mostly mild, with symptoms such as eye redness and cough, experts warn that it could become deadlier if it mixes with seasonal flu viruses. Vasso Apostolopoulos, an immunologist, suggests that genetic differences in the H5N1 virus in Cambodia may account for its higher virulence. Francesco Branda, an epidemiologist, notes that the US cases involve able-bodied farm employees, making it unclear whether older adults or people with medical conditions would show mild symptoms. The CDC has not found any evidence of person-to-person spread, but experts warn that reassortment, where multiple strains of influenza infect the same person, could lead to the emergence of a new, highly virulent strain. Public health agencies are urged to increase testing of animals and humans in contact with affected animals, and broader surveillance testing across the country.

**From poultry to public health: Understanding the H5N1 threat**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is monitoring the spread of avian influenza (H5N1) in the United States, particularly among poultry and dairy workers. As of October 9, 2024, 18 human cases of H5N1 have been reported in the US since 2022. The CDC has allocated over 100,000 doses of seasonal flu vaccine for farm workers in 12 states with positive H5 cases to mitigate the risk of spread. The agency is also testing existing candidate vaccines for effectiveness against current H5N1 strains. Meghan Davis, DVM, PhD, MPH, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, emphasized the importance of the One Health approach in addressing zoonotic diseases like H5N1. The CDC is working with public health laboratories to monitor influenza virus testing and flu surveillance data using CDC's enhanced nationwide summer surveillance strategy. The agency is also providing safety measures for veterinary professionals and clients, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and biosecurity protocols. According to Kemba Marshall, MPH, DVM, DABVP (Avian), SHRM-CP, founder of Marshall Recruiting Consortium, 'Biosecurity also means we should be able to have a record and a log of every person that came to the fair, animal exhibition, or farm.' The CDC recommends that feline owners who have interacted with animals or birds with unknown health status change their clothes and shoes before interacting with personal pets. The agency is also warning against consuming unpasteurized milk due to the H5N1 bird flu virus found in more than 140 US dairy herds and high levels in raw milk.

**From Poultry to Public Health: Understanding the H5N1 Threat**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is monitoring the spread of H5N1 avian influenza in the United States, with 18 human cases reported since 2022. The virus has primarily circulated in the Midwest, with cases raising concerns about potential human transmission and broader public health implications. Despite the rise in cases, the CDC maintains that the risk to the public remains low, although those with occupational exposure to sick animals face a higher risk. The CDC is using the One Health approach to monitor the situation, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. The agency has deployed a multilingual epidemiological field team to assist local health departments with outreach and surveillance efforts. To date, more than 5100 individuals exposed to potentially infected animals have been monitored, and more than 54,000 specimens have been tested for H5N1 viruses. The CDC has also allocated more than 100,000 doses of seasonal flu vaccine for farm workers in 12 states with positive H5 cases to mitigate the risk of spread. Additionally, the CDC is testing existing candidate vaccines for effectiveness against current H5N1 strains. Recent studies suggest that licensed adjuvanted H5N1 vaccines may generate cross-neutralizing antibodies against circulating variants, aiding in pandemic preparedness. The CDC advises that it is currently unlikely humans can become infected through an infected stray, wild, feral, or domestic cat, but human infection can be possible if there is prolonged unprotected exposure to infected animals in individuals not wearing personal protective equipment. The agency also recommends feline owners who have interacted with animals or birds with unknown health status change their clothes and shoes before interacting with personal pets. For owners of potentially infected pets, veterinarians should refer them to their state's Department of Public Health and Environment in order to monitor human exposure and potential human disease transmission.

**Washington Reports First Human Cases of H5N1 Avian Influenza**
The state of Washington in the US has reported the first four human cases of H5N1 avian influenza, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) awaiting confirmation. The cases involve four agricultural workers who tested positive for the virus after working with infected poultry at a commercial egg farm in Franklin County. They have shown mild symptoms and have been treated with antiviral medication. The Department of Health in Washington has stated that this is the first suspected human case of H5 virus under investigation in the state. The cases occurred at a facility that was the site of an avian influenza outbreak in poultry. Approximately 800,000 birds were culled after test results from the Washington Department of Agriculture on October 15 revealed the infection. The investigation into the workers continues, and measures have been put in place to protect them. Washington is the sixth state to identify a human infection with H5N1. The highly pathogenic (HPAI) H5N1 virus has caused ongoing outbreaks in poultry, dairy cattle, and wildlife. 'Washington has closely monitored the spread of H5N1 since it was first detected in poultry in 2022, and our state is prepared, has the knowledge and tools to minimize its impact on our community,' said Washington Secretary of Health Umair Shah. In recent days, five other possible human cases of H5N1 avian influenza have been reported by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), in people from the Central Valley who had direct contact with infected dairy cows. Six cases have been confirmed in California, where public health authorities continue to proactively test symptomatic individuals. A biomarker for avian influenza was detected in wastewater in Texas weeks before the outbreaks in cattle were reported. This is one of the findings from a study presented at the ID Week, the annual meeting of leading scientific societies dedicated to infectious diseases in the US. Researchers from the WastewaterScan team at Stanford University used a sensor to detect virus fragments in wastewater treatment plants across the US. The surveillance implemented retrospectively to investigate an unusually high level of influenza A in Texas at the beginning of 2024 was able to detect the virus two weeks before the cases in dairy cows were reported and a month before the virus was confirmed. 'Every second counts when responding to emerging pathogens,' emphasized Alessandro Zulli, postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University, in the IDWeek press release. 'The widespread use of wastewater surveillance will provide public health professionals with the early warning system they need to tackle these infectious threats.'

**H5N1 Bird Flu: What You Need to Know**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 27 human cases of avian influenza A(H5) in the US from March to October 2024. The cases include 17 dairy cattle workers, 9 poultry workers, and 1 person without occupational exposure. All patients received oseltamivir treatment and recovered. The CDC has confirmed that dairy cow-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has occurred in the US for the first time. The virus has been detected in dairy cows in Texas, Michigan, Colorado, and California. The CDC has also reported cases of avian influenza A(H5) in poultry workers in Colorado, with 9 cases identified. The virus was associated with exposure to A(H5N1) virus during outbreaks among chickens at two commercial egg-laying facilities in Colorado. The CDC has confirmed a case in Missouri who was hospitalized with atypical symptoms. The source of the virus is unknown, and no secondary transmission to close contacts was identified. The CDC has recommended that any detection of influenza A virus in a respiratory specimen from a human patient across any healthcare setting in the US be subtyped. This includes testing for A(H5) virus. The CDC has also recommended that people who work with infected animals, such as poultry and dairy cows, utilize recommended PPE, including an N95 respirator, eye protection, a protective gown, and gloves. 'We're not seeing severe disease and there were no hospitalizations required,' said Cara Drehoff, Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer at the CDC. 'We didn't see any evidence of human-to-human transmission, and all of the workers who tested positive had been handling sick or dead birds.' The CDC has also emphasized the importance of ongoing surveillance of A(H5N1) viruses in wild birds, poultry, farmed and wild mammals, dairy cows, and any other infected animals to monitor the public health threat. 'Because A(H5N1) viruses, like all influenza A viruses, are dynamic and continually evolving, ongoing surveillance of these viruses is critical to monitoring the public health threat,' said Tim Uyeki, Chief Medical Officer for the Influenza Division at the CDC. 'We will continue to work closely with our local and state health partners on enhanced surveillance for influenza A viruses and novel influenza A viruses.'

**Washington reports four presumptive H5N1 cases in humans**
The Washington State Department of Health (DOH) announced four commercial egg farm workers tested presumptively positive for avian influenza (H5N1) on October 20. The workers, who experienced mild symptoms, were exposed to infected poultry on a farm in Franklin County. The DOH is working with the Benton-Franklin Health District (BFHD), the Washington State Department of Agriculture, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to determine a regional response to the outbreak. According to Umair Shah, Washington secretary of health, 'Washington has monitored the spread of H5N1 closely since it was first detected in poultry in the state in 2022, and our state is prepared with the knowledge, relationships, and tools to minimize its impacts on our community.' The CDC reports a total of 27 human cases of H5N1 in the United States, with the risk to the general public considered low.

**California reports first suspected H5N1 bird flu patient amid fears virus is spreading between people for first time**
A dairy worker in California has tested 'presumptive positive' for the bird flu, H5N1, possibly becoming the 15th person in the US to contract the disease. The patient, who works at a dairy facility experiencing an outbreak, is experiencing mild symptoms, including conjunctivitis. Fears are growing that the virus may be spreading between people for the first time, as a patient in Missouri was diagnosed with the virus without coming into contact with sick birds or animals. Dr. Kruitka Kuppali warned, 'This is how pandemics start.' The CDC has reported that since March 2024, over 4,900 people have been monitored for exposure to H5N1, with 230 tested and 14 positive cases. The current risk to the public remains low, but people with frequent contact with birds and livestock are at increased risk.
