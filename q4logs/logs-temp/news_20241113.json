The Dow, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq futures were down 0.14%, 0.14%, and 0.13%, respectively. Economists predict core inflation to rise 0.3% and the headline number to increase 0.2% on a monthly basis. Investors see a 66% chance of a 25-basis point interest rate cut at the Fed's December meeting. Rate-sensitive megacap stocks, such as Meta Platforms and Microsoft, were lower in premarket trading, while Tesla gained 2.6% after closing down 6.2% in the previous session. The S&amp;P 500 has gained about 3.5% since the close on Nov. 5, and is on track for year-to-date gains of more than 25%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 11:30 AM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-14077371/US-STOCKS-Futures-slip-markets-await-inflation-data-clues-Feds-rate-path.html)\n\n**Stock Market Today: Dow futures fall as traders eye CPI inflation data**\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 futures are down 0.2%, 0.1%, and 0.1% respectively, indicating a cautious start to equity trading on Wall Street. The post-election rally has run out of steam, with the S&P 500 up 3.5% from the election day close. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said, 'U.S. markets tapped on the brakes after a blistering post-election rally which propelled each of the main indices to record highs.' The increase in implied borrowing costs is due to concerns that the incoming Trump administration's policies may stoke inflationary pressures. The U.S. consumer price index report for October will be the main focus, and any sign of building inflationary pressures may reduce the chances of another 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve in December.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 10:20 AM\nSource:[MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-futures-fall-as-traders-eye-cpi-inflation-report)\n\n**Dow, S&P 500 Futures Falling After Hitting Record Highs**\nU.S. stock futures are falling early Tuesday after the S&P 500 closed above 6,000 for the first time yesterday. The index is on course for its first back-to-back yearly gains of more than 20% since 1998. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are down 35 points, or 0.1%, after closing above 44,000 for the first time yesterday. The market is optimistic about lower taxes and looser regulation under Donald Trump's presidency, which is expected to boost company earnings over the next four years. With two months to go before Trump takes office, the market is already responding to his anticipated plans, as well as data and earnings such as inflation figures and Home Depot earnings out this week.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 09:21 AM\nSource:[biztoc.com](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-111224/card/dow-s-p-500-futures-falling-after-record-highs-zTxBZMBVuX5EMjpPy3dN?ref=biztoc.com)\n\n**S&P 500 Forecast: Can Bulls Maintain Momentum Ahead of Wednesday's CPI Data?**\nStock futures rose on Monday as Wall Street sought to build on last week's gains, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at all-time highs. The Dow surged above the 44,000 level for the first time, and the S&P 500 had its best week in nearly a year, driven by renewed investor confidence after the presidential election outcome. The rally spread broadly across sectors, with the Nasdaq and the small-cap-focused Russell 2000 also advancing.

The index has risen 62% of the time in November with an average return of 0.96%, and 74% of the time in December with an average return of 1.32%. They also noted that if the S&P 500 is up year-to-date through October, it has historically continued to rise 79% of the time in the November-December period, with average and median returns of 4.00% and 4.27%, respectively. Strategists emphasized that this pattern of strength is particularly pronounced in Presidential election years. From a technical analysis perspective, the SPX has maintained its tactical support within the bullish trend, and needs to regain its October highs in the 5870s to continue the bullish trend. 'If the SPX struggles below the October highs, the risk would increase for a retest of the cup and handle breakout zone in the 5600s with the rising 50-day moving average (MA) near 5688,' strategists wrote. In terms of market sentiment, individual investor survey signals a decline in bullishness, but not yet bearishness, as indicated by the still positive Bulls versus Bears spread.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 12:20 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sp-500-has-bullish-novemberdecember-seasonality-bofa-3688136)\n\n**S&P 500 has bullish November-December seasonality: BofA**\nBank of America strategists note that the S&P 500 (SPX) has a 'bullish November-December seasonality,' with the index rising 62% of the time in November and 74% of the time in December.

This signal, combined with Yale Hirsch's research on market seasonality, suggests that investors may want to consider increasing exposure to equities, particularly in large-cap stocks. However, it's essential to recognize that while the MACD signal aligns with historical trends, it does not guarantee future performance. Analysts have lowered earnings estimates, but this could lead to a high 'beat rate' by companies, fueling stock prices in the short term. Additionally, corporate share buyback windows will reopen in November and December, with nearly $1 Trillion in authorizations for 2024. As noted by Goldman Sachs, the pace of buybacks will be exceptionally strong this year, providing sufficient buying power to lift asset prices into year-end. However, the technical backdrop also poses near-term risks, with the market deviating well above MONTHLY moving averages and overbought, a correction or consolidation is becoming increasingly likely before the year-end advance can take shape.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2024 08:40 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-this-seasonal-macd-buy-signal-points-to-a-strong-yearend-rally-200653268)\n\n**Here's something for the bulls to celebrate over the next 10 weeks**\nHistorical data suggests that if the S & P 500 ends October with a six-month trailing return above 10%, it will likely finish December higher than where it ended October. Since 1950, there have been 12 instances where the S & P 500 met this criteria, and in every case, the index gained an average of 7.4% in November and December. Steve Deppe of Nerad + Deppe Wealth Management notes that while the market is near all-time highs and has had an unusually strong first three quarters, the data suggests that discipline with an investment strategy is more appropriate than acting on emotional bias. Deppe expects the S & P 500 to finish 2024 above 6,000, which would leave around 3% more upside from its current level. He also believes that the market could continue rallying into the first half of 2025, but may 'run out of gas' next summer. 'Right now, I think we have a mostly goldilocks environment from a price action standpoint,' Deppe said, 'which would lead me to believe that the fundamental state is probably going to be better than we all think moving forward.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2024 07:45 PM\nSource:[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/18/heres-something-for-the-bulls-to-celebrate-over-the-next-10-weeks.html)\n\n**UBS Predicts S&P 500 to Reach 6,400 by End of 2025**\nUBS predicts that the S&P 500 will reach 6,400 by the end of 2025. Strategist Jonathan Golub has raised his target for the S&P 500 to 6,400 from 6,000 in a note to clients published on Tuesday. The new forecast implies a 9.2% increase from the closing price on Monday. Golub cited 'economic support' as the catalyst for the change. 'UBS economists predict a nominal GDP of 3.7% in 2025 (1.6% real), approximately in line with long-term averages,' he said. Additionally, 'rate cuts should reduce interest expenses and default risk, adding to both earnings per share and valuations.' Golub's call comes a day after the S&P 500 reached a new record, with its year-to-date gains reaching nearly 23%. Stocks have been on a roll recently, as investors see more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve on the horizon. 'Valuations tend to expand when the Fed cuts rates in non-recessionary environments,' said the strategist. 'Despite high valuations, we expect P/Es to increase [half] a point additional.' Golub also noted that a 'strong drop in Fed Funds would likely increase profit margins by 20 basis points through lower interest expenses.' A basis point is 1/100 of a percent, or 0.01%. The FedWatch tool from CME Group shows that operators of futures contracts for federal funds at 30 days see an 88% probability of a quarter-point rate cut in November, followed by an additional reduction of 25 basis points in December. The Fed lowered its federal funds rate target by half a point, to a range of 4.75% to 5.00%, in September. Golub does not see the stock market making further gains for the rest of this year. Although he increased his estimate for 2024 in the benchmark index to 5,850 from 5,600, that actually signals a slight decline from current levels.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 06:25 PM\nSource:[cronicaweb.com](https://www.cronicaweb.com/ubs-proyecta-que-el-sp-500-alcance-los-6400-para-finales-de-2025/)\n\n**S&P 500 to hit 'well north' of 6,000 by the end of 2024 amid stock FOMO: Goldman By Investing.com**\nThe S&P 500 has seen a remarkable surge, up 42.3% from its low on October 27, 2023, and has hit 46 new all-time highs in 2024. Strategists at Goldman Sachs believe that the index could be 'well north of 6K by the end of the year' due to the fear of underperforming benchmark equity indices, referred to as 'FOMU.' This sentiment is driving institutional investors to take on more aggressive positions, with US corporates expected to inject approximately $6 billion into the market daily until the year's end. Historically, the S&P 500 has seen a median return of +5.17% from October 15th to December 31st, which could suggest a year-end level of $6160 based on today's level, or $6270 in election years.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 04:52 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sp-500-to-hit-well-north-of-6000-by-the-end-of-2024-amid-stock-fomo-goldman-3664213)\n\n**UBS sees S&P 500 soaring to 6,400 by the end of 2025**\nUBS strategist Jonathan Golub has raised his 2025 S & P 500 target to 6,400 from 6,000, implying a 9.2% upside from Monday's close. Golub points to a 'supportive' economic backdrop, including 3.7% nominal GDP in 2025 and rate cuts, as a catalyst for the change. He expects valuations to rise despite elevated levels, and a 'sharp decline in Fed Funds will likely increase profit margins by 20 basis points via lower interest expense.' The CME Group's FedWatch tool shows traders see an 88% chance of a quarter percentage point rate cut in November, followed by an additional 25 basis-point reduction in December. Golub doesn't see the stock market making further gains the rest of this year, and instead expects stocks to consolidate before scaling new heights in the new year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 01:11 PM\nSource:[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/15/ubs-sees-sp-500-soaring-to-6400-by-the-end-of-2025.html)\n\n**The S&P 500 Just Did Something for the 1st Time This Century. History Says the Stock Market Will Do This Next.**\nThe S&P 500 has seen a 20.8% increase in the first three quarters of 2024, with Nvidia accounting for nearly one-quarter of the gains. This is the first time in the 21st century the S&P 500 has returned at least 20% through the first three quarters. According to history, the index could see even higher gains in the fourth quarter, with a median return of 31% in years where the index has gained at least 20% through the first three quarters. This would put the S&P 500 at 6,249 by December 31, implying nearly 9% upside in the remaining weeks of the fourth quarter. However, investor sentiment and macroeconomic data will play a significant role in determining the stock market's performance in the coming weeks. Many stocks in the S&P 500 trade at historically expensive valuations, and several important data points will be announced later this month, including the Consumer Price Index report and job openings. The S&P 500 currently trades at 26.7 times earnings, a premium to the five-year average and the 10-year average. Wall Street strategists expect the S&P 500 to decline modestly in the weeks ahead, with a median year-end target of 5,600, implying 3% downside from its current level.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 07:49 AM\nSource:[latestnigeriannews.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-500-just-did-something-074900295.html)\n\n**September's Positive Trend Expected to Continue**\nSeptember has been an unusual month for the stock market, with the S&P 500 index rising by 2%. According to Josephine Cetti, chief strategist at Nordea, this positive trend is expected to continue in the coming months, despite some risk factors. The recent positive numbers, including a 0.5% decrease in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, have helped to boost optimism in the market. The tech sector has also made a comeback, which has contributed to the overall positive trend. Cetti notes that the large tech companies have a significant impact on the market, and when they perform well, they can pull the market up with them. The S&P 500 index has risen by 20% so far this year, and Cetti expects this trend to continue. However, there are still some risks to consider, including the upcoming US presidential election and ongoing geopolitical tensions. Cetti believes that the overall picture for the stock market in 2024 is positive, with inflation on the decline and economic growth on the rise. She also expects the 'Santa Claus Rally' to occur in November and December, which is a period of increased risk-taking and buying of underperforming stocks. 'We expect this to happen again this year,' Cetti says.\nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 03:35 PM\nSource:[B.T.](https://www.bt.dk/penge/september-har-vaeret-en-atypisk-aktiemaaned-chefstrateg-tror-paa-yderligere)\n\n**SP500: The Q3 Topping Process Could Turn Into The Q4 Bubble Burst**\nThe S&P 500 Index is currently trading at a high P/E ratio of around 24, significantly overvalued by historical standards. Analysts expect a 14.3% earnings growth in 2025, but many indicators point to a recession in 2025, which would typically lead to negative earnings growth. The S&P 500 is entering Q4 2024 with a high valuation, overly optimistic earnings growth expectations, and a recession looming. The market's volatility has increased, with the S&P VIX Index rising 40% in Q3. The author believes the S&P 500 is in the topping process, with three peaks in Q3, and the current peak could be the top. The Q4 preview is uncertain, with the US election in November being a key variable. The author expects the economic data to deteriorate after the election, and the geopolitical situation to escalate. The Fed is likely to cut interest rates in November and December, which could signal a recession and cause a major selloff in the S&P 500. The Gen AI bubble burst is also a risk, with the author expecting a sharp selloff if there are earnings misses or guidance revisions from Gen AI mega-caps. The 2024 Q4 is particularly risky due to the uncertainties with the US election and the escalating geopolitical situation, and investors are advised to reduce their exposure to the stock market, especially those close to retirement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2024 11:10 PM\nSource:[Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724326-sp500-the-q3-topping-process-could-turn-into-the-q4-bubble-burst)\n\n**S&P/TSX composite tops 24,000 points for first time, U.S. markets also rise Thursday**\nThe S&P/TSX composite index closed at 24,033.83, surpassing 24,000 points for the first time.

Two additional 25-point base interventions are planned for November and December, which should result in a total of 100 points of base easing in 2024, followed by another 100 points in 2025. The central bank's strategy is to act decisively now and then more moderately, in order to avoid a recession in the United States.

Despite a recent update that brought back some players, the game's troubles are far from over. Allowing Helldivers 2 to win Game of the Year would send the wrong message to the gaming community and enable companies to overlook player needs. Sony's handling of the game, including its decision to require a PlayStation Network account for Steam players, has been sloppy and has highlighted the company's disconnect with its player community. 'It would suggest that companies can get away with launching unfinished or poorly managed games and still receive accolades based on initial success,' said the author.

Space Marine 2 offers a power fantasy with boss battles, gory combat, and superhuman playable characters, as well as several progression systems and customization options. In contrast, Helldivers 2 is a more chaotic co-op experience with a focus on teamwork and a variety of planets, enemies, and objectives. While Space Marine 2's gameplay loop is more repetitive, its character and weapon progression systems are more complex and rewarding. Additionally, Space Marine 2 has a PvP game mode and an offline mode, making it more accessible to solo players. However, its repetitiveness is addressed by a 2024-2025 roadmap that will add new content, including new Operations, a new enemy type, and a new weapon. Helldivers 2, on the other hand, will continue to grow over time with new content, but its weapon-balancing problem needs to be resolved. Ultimately, both games offer unique experiences and are enjoyable in their own ways.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2024 11:00 AM\nSource:[Game Rant](https://gamerant.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-helldivers-similarities-differences-good-bad)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The company's recent quarterly results showed a 6% decline in net sales and an operating loss of $23.7 million. The stock has been trading like a cryptocurrency and speculative buy, and its market cap of $6.6 billion is difficult to justify based on its financial performance and growth prospects. Analyst David Jagielski suggests not buying the stock, citing its uncertain future and high risk. However, the article also mentions that the company's social media platform Truth Social and streaming service Truth+ may see increased traffic and interest, which could lead to improved results for the company.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 11:27 AM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trump-media-stock-heading-back-all-time-highs)\n\n**Phillip Juhan Sells 320,000 Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.

This transaction reduced his ownership stake in the company by 0.00%. The stock has been trading down 8.8% and has a 1 year low of $11.75 and a 1 year high of $79.38.

The company's concept, Truth Social, was created as a competitor to Twitter after Trump was banned, but Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter has invalidated this competitive advantage. With little incentive to leave X (Twitter) and repost to Truth Social, the company's managers have a difficult task to broaden the site's appeal beyond Trump. The company's financials show a significant increase in losses, and its high price-to-sales ratio and book value make it a stock to avoid. 'Unless Truth Social can draw considerably more activity unrelated to the past and future president, Trump Media stock is unlikely to drive market-beating returns.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 11:00 PM\nSource:[fool.com](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/11/11/should-you-buy-trump-media-stock-trump-victory/)\n\n**Trump Media stock plummets 22% after five-week surge - UPI.com**\nAfter a five-week surge, the stock of Truth Social's owner, Trump Media & Technology Group, plummeted 22.3% on Wednesday, resulting in a $1.3 billion loss in former President Donald Trump's net worth.

This represents the company's worst daily performance since its initial public offering, surpassing the 21.5% decline on April 1. The company has not issued a statement explaining the sudden drop, but some traders attribute it to the loss of momentum and technical factors. Matthew Tottle, CEO of Tottle Capital Management, believes that the failure to maintain momentum and reach new highs is the reason for the heavy selling seen on Wednesday.

CEO Devin Nunes has stated that the company will continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future. Short sellers have also targeted the company, shorting about 12% of all outstanding DJT shares. Trump losing the November election may put additional pressure on the stock, making its future unpredictable.

Truth Social, the social network associated with the Trump Media & Technology Group, has seen a 45% increase in value over the past week, reaching $23.85. 57% of Truth Social's shares are owned by Republican candidate Donald Trump.

Trump has repeatedly claimed he has no intention of selling his shares, saying, 'No, I'm not selling. No, I love it.' However, other insiders, including co-founders Andy Litinsky and Wes Moss, are also eligible to sell their shares, raising the possibility that they could choose to exit.

The stock price dropped by over 3% to around $14.25 per share after spiking to nearly $18 last week. This decline is due to the expiration of lock-up agreements, which prevented insiders, including Donald Trump, and investors from selling their shares. Trump stated in an interview last week, 'I will not be selling my shares.' The sale of shares by large investors could put additional pressure on the already struggling stock price. The stock price was around $70 at the beginning of the year, particularly after the merger with a blank-check company. The expiration of lock-up agreements may also lead to increased short-selling of the stock, according to an analysis by S3 Partners. Trump Media was the worst-performing stock in the Russell 1000 index on Thursday, according to Bespoke Investment Group, despite the index as a whole increasing in value over the same period.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 10:36 PM\nSource:[Klamm](https://www.klamm.de/news/insiderverkaeufe-belasten-trump-media-aktienrueckgang-setzt-sich-fort-64N20240921003620.html)\n\n**Trump Media Stock Plummets to All-Time Low**\nThe actions of Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) plummeted to their all-time low on Friday, the first day of trading where its main shareholder, former President Donald Trump, is free to sell his stake in the company behind the Truth Social platform. TMTG's actions dropped by nearly 8% to close at $13.55 USD, valuing the company at less than $3 billion USD. Mr. Trump owns more than half of the company. Despite the volatile action, the billionaire and other insiders were unable to profit due to standard lock-up agreements that prevent major stakeholders from selling shares during a defined period after the company goes public. TMTG began trading on the stock exchange in March. According to SEC documents, Donald Trump owns approximately 115 million shares of the company, valued at around $1.6 billion USD based on the stock's price on Friday morning. It is generally not in the interest of major shareholders to try to sell large blocks of their shares, as it could risk a wider sale. Since TMTG's listing on the stock exchange, its actions have fluctuated greatly, often in response to news related to its first shareholder, the Republican presidential candidate. Last week, the company's actions surged by nearly 12% after Mr. Trump stated that he would not sell any shares when the lock-up period was lifted. The action dropped by over 10% after the debate at the beginning of the month between the Republican and Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris. In mid-July, the actions rose by over 31% on the first day of trading after the first attempt on Trump's life. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. is now worth significantly less than it was several months ago. When the company debuted on the Nasdaq in March, the actions reached a peak of $79.38 USD. The closing price on Friday represents an 83% drop from that peak. Truth Social was established when Donald Trump was banned from Twitter (now X) and Facebook following the January 6, 2021 Capitol riots. Based in Sarasota, Florida, Trump Media is losing money and struggling to generate revenue. It lost nearly $58.2 million USD last year while generating only $4.1 million USD in revenue, according to regulatory documents.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 10:03 PM\nSource:[L’actualité](https://lactualite.com/actualites/les-actions-de-trump-media-chutent-jusqua-leur-plus-bas-niveau-de-tous-les-temps)\n\n**In 'Major Moment' for Trump Media, Stocks Take a New Dip**\nShares for Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of Truth Social, fell nearly 7% to a record low of $13.73 on Friday, making the company worth less than $3 billion.

The decline comes as a lock-up period ends, allowing Trump to sell shares for the first time. Trump formed the company in 2021 after being voted out of the White House and launched the Truth Social platform after being banned on X (then Twitter) and other social media outlets. Despite a strong launch, the company's stock prices have been volatile, and it has yet to turn a profit. Trump owns approximately 57% of the company and has tried to calm investors by saying he's not leaving, stating, 'People think that I'm leaving. That's why they're down, because it's different if I leave. But I'm not leaving.'

Shares of the company, which owns Truth Social, have fallen by nearly 72% since reaching a peak in March, raising concerns about the enterprise's long-term viability. Analysts and experts have expressed concerns about the financial fundamentals of TMTG, citing its struggle to generate substantial revenue and its minor presence in the competitive social media landscape. As Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, said, 'If this wasn't Trump, this thing would be trading at $1.' The company's future hinges largely on Trump's success in the election, and experts warn that separating politics from profits is essential. Despite its stock market struggles, TMTG still holds over $300 million in cash and equivalents, giving it financial power to pursue acquisitions and support its operations. However, the lock-up period preventing Trump and other insiders from selling shares is set to expire on September 20, 2024, which could potentially flood the market and drive prices even lower.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2024 09:53 PM\nSource:[The Trent](https://www.thetrentonline.com/truth-social-wipeout-the-4-billion-blow-to-the-donald-trump-media-empire)\n\n**Trump Media stock hits new low — just as Trump, others are able to sell shares**\nFormer President Donald Trump and other insiders at Trump Media & Technology Group, the owner of Truth Social, can now sell their shares in the company after a lock-up period expired.

With the six-month lockup period expiring, former president Donald Trump is likely to sell his 114.5 million shares of TMTG, which could trigger a fire sale and further tank the company's already low share value. University of Florida business professor Jay Ritter said, 'The only bull case for the stock that I can think of is the greater fool theory of investing.'

According to Trump, Musk will work in partnership with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who made his fortune in biotechnology and finance and is a climate crisis denier. Trump stated, 'Together, these two great Americans will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, reduce excessive regulations, cut unnecessary expenses, and restructure federal agencies.' Trump added, 'It will be potentially the 'Manhattan Project' of our era.' Trump said, 'To lead this kind of drastic change, the department will provide advice and recommendations from outside the government and collaborate with the White House to guide a large-scale structural reform and create a never-before-seen business approach. I'm looking forward to Elon and Vivek bringing changes to federal bureaucracy.' Trump stated that the work of the two appointees will end 'at the latest on July 4, 2026.' Trump said, 'It will be the perfect gift to America on the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.' Musk was one of Trump's main campaign supporters, but his arrival in government raises questions about potential conflicts of interest. Musk's companies have large contracts with the US administration, particularly in the aerospace field, and their activities are subject to federal regulations, such as the development of autonomous cars by Tesla.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 11:57 AM\nSource:[Terra](https://www.terra.com.br/noticias/mundo/trump-indica-musk-para-chefiar-departamento-de-eficiencia,7ff3cbc18c19422ae2c203bfa1c6344dhwwyk44j.html)\n\n**Elon Musk to Lead 'Department of Government Efficiency' in Trump's Incoming Administration**\nUS President-elect Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, will lead the 'Department of Government Efficiency' alongside Vivek Ramaswamy.

This appointment is part of a series of appointments for Trump's incoming administration, including the appointment of his campaign manager, Susie Wiles, as the head of the White House staff. Trump has decided not to include his children in his new administration, unlike his first term, when his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner held advisory positions in the White House. Trump is preparing to return to the White House after winning the 2024 presidential election and is set to take office officially on January 20, marking the beginning of his second term after a four-year absence. The expectations are high for the policies Trump will adopt in his second term, which include issues related to the economy, trade, foreign policy, and immigration.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 03:37 AM\nSource:[akhbarelyom.com](https://akhbarelyom.com/news/newdetails/4488019/1/%D8%A5%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%83-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%A8-%D9%88%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%83%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A1%D8%A9-%D8%A7)\n\n**Will the Alliance Between Trump and Musk Break Down?**\nElon Musk and Donald Trump, the world's two most powerful men, have formed a strong alliance in recent months. However, experts predict that a disagreement between the two is inevitable due to their strong personalities. According to CNN, Trump will not share the spotlight with Musk during his 2024 presidential campaign, despite praising Musk in the past. Musk played a significant role in Trump's campaign, particularly in the key state of Pennsylvania, and shared pro-Trump content on social media platform X. Insiders close to Trump say, 'Elon is very temperamental and Trump is too. I don't think Trump will enjoy the attention Elon will bring. He's an attention-seeker.'

Susie Wiles has been appointed as White House chief of staff, with Trump praising her as 'tough, smart, innovative... universally admired and respected'. However, the role is seen as a thankless task, with Trump's previous four chief of staffs failing to flourish. Other figures linked to the role include Mike Davis, a lawyer and former Senate aide who has made headlines for threatening New York Attorney General Letitia James and has been linked to the role of attorney general. Davis has also asked for 'pardon and commutation lists' and has expressed a desire to 'drag the dead political bodies of Trump's opponents through the streets'. Trump is also considering Robert F Kennedy Jr for a prominent role in health policy, despite his vaccine conspiracy theories and support for removing fluoride from public drinking water. Other figures linked to the administration include Elon Musk, who has backed Trump's campaign and has said he expects a role in slashing the federal budget, and Stephen Miller, a far-right immigration hawk.

Jason Miller, a Trump advisor, said, 'There are people who are returning, others who are new, not just big names, but also Democrats, independents, and business leaders.' Trump has already nominated Susie Wiles as his chief of staff, a highly strategic position that has never been held by a woman. Mike Lee and Eric Schmitt are mentioned as potential candidates for the position of Secretary of State. Richard Grenell, a former ambassador to Germany, is also being considered for the role. Grenell has been described as 'a diplomat from the shadows' and has a reputation for being tough. He has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the position of National Security Adviser, which could make Marco Rubio, a senator from Florida, the new Secretary of State. Mike Pompeo, a former Secretary of State, could be chosen to lead the Pentagon. The CIA directorship could go to John Ratcliffe, a former congressman from Texas, or Kash Patel, a former White House staffer. The position of Treasury Secretary could be disputed between Scott Bessent and John Paulson, two billionaires who are patrons of investment funds. Elon Musk, the world's richest man, could be tasked with reorganizing the federal administration, potentially leading to significant budget cuts. Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a nephew of President John F. Kennedy, could be responsible for public health policies, despite being critical of vaccination.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 06:38 AM\nSource:[Courrier international](https://www.courrierinternational.com/depeche/le-who-s-who-d-un-gouvernement-trump-2.afp.com.20241108.doc.36lp8lu.xml)\n\n**Trump Begins Appointments, Names Susan Wiles as White House Chief of Staff**\nUS President-elect Donald Trump has announced the appointment of his campaign manager, Susan Wiles, as the White House Chief of Staff, his first appointment in his upcoming administration. Trump said in a statement, 'Suzi Wiles helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history.' He added that Wiles 'will continue to work tirelessly to make America great again,' referring to his campaign's slogan. Trump also reminded that Wiles will be the first woman in US history to hold this position, considering it 'a well-deserved honor.' The White House Chief of Staff is considered the most strategic center of power in the US executive branch, equivalent to the position of Head of the Presidential Office or Head of the Royal Court in other countries. It is expected that Trump's administration will feature several controversial figures, including Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Musk is likely to play a key role in the administration after his active involvement in Trump's campaign. Trump may also appoint Kennedy, the son of the late president and a former independent candidate who has become an ally, to oversee public health responsibilities. Kennedy has been critical of vaccination and stated on NBC that he 'will not prevent people from getting vaccinated,' but believes Americans should be able to 'make their own decisions.' Trump is also expected to appoint Musk to oversee a federal administration overhaul, as one of the world's richest men and a strong advocate for reducing government involvement.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 03:34 AM\nSource:[aljazeera.net](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2024/11/8/%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%B3%D9%85%D9%8A-%D9%83%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9-2)\n\n**The Trump administration transition starts now.

Tesla stans aren't bound by logic.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 06:36 PM\nSource:[Jalopnik](https://jalopnik.com/you-can-get-a-brand-new-tesla-cybertruck-in-a-week-if-y-1851695016)\n\n**Here's How Much A Tesla Model 3 Depreciates After 3 Years**\nA Tesla Model 3 loses an average of $15,228 of its value within three years, according to iSeeCars. The average resale value of a three-year-old Model 3 is $23,762, which is 60.9% of its brand-new price. This is due to Tesla's aggressive price cuts and the fact that EVs tend to depreciate faster than ICE cars. The Model 3's depreciation rate is 39.1% after three years, which is comparable to other electric compact cars in the premium segment. However, it is higher than the depreciation rate of ICE compact sedans and all sedans in general. The article also discusses the factors contributing to EV depreciation, including rapid technological advancements and the influence of Chinese EV makers on the global market.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 04:11 PM\nSource:[Top Speed](https://www.topspeed.com/how-much-tesla-model-3-depreciates-3-years/)\n\n**2024 Tesla Model 3**\nThe 2024 Tesla Model 3 has received an update, including new headlights and a revised front fascia. The base rear-wheel drive model can accelerate from 0-100 km/h in 6.1 seconds, while the AWD trim can do it in 4.4 seconds. The Model 3 has a range of 438-549 km on a full battery, depending on the trim. It has received top 'good' marks in standard safety tests, but has some concerns with reliability, including distracting controls and a stiff suspension. The interior is minimalist, with a central screen and dynamic steering wheel buttons. The dimensions are similar to a Honda Civic, with a length of 4,694 mm and a height of 1,443 mm. The Canadian pricing starts at $53,900 for the rear-wheel drive model, with an additional $10,000 for the Long Range suffix.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 05, 2049 12:00 AM\nSource:[driving.ca](https://driving.ca/tesla/model-3/)\n\n**Tesla has plans for cheaper electric car models**\nTesla reaffirmed its plan to make electric cars more affordable in a shareholder update, with new models expected to start production in the first half of 2025. The company aims to make electric vehicles (EVs) competitive with all forms of transportation in terms of total cost of ownership per mile. Currently, the cheapest Tesla model is the Model 3, which starts at £39,990. A new, more compact hatchback design is expected to be part of the affordable range, with prices expected to be around £23,000 or less. The Cybercab, a two-seater autonomous car, is planned for release by 2027 and is expected to cost $30,000 or less. The new models will compete with other affordable EVs such as the MG G4, Nissan Leaf, and Citroën e-C3. However, Tesla is currently facing a lawsuit from Alcon Entertainment over copyright infringement related to the Cybercab launch.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 02:31 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/tesla-plans-cheaper-electric-car-142741239.html)\n\n**Tesla says it's on track to produce \"more affordable\" vehicles in 2025**\nTesla has reiterated its plans to produce more affordable vehicles in 2025, with preparations underway for new models that will launch in the first half of next year. The company's current cheapest vehicle is the Long Range rear-wheel drive Model 3, priced at $42,490 before subsidies. Tesla had previously announced plans for a $25,000 EV, codenamed NV9, but these plans were reportedly abandoned earlier this year. However, Elon Musk has recommitted to producing more affordable vehicles, and the company will utilize aspects of its next-generation platform and current manufacturing lines to achieve cost reductions. While the new EV will be cheaper, it is unlikely to have a price tag as low as $25,000, as Tesla wrote, 'This approach [to manufacturing] will result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected but enables us to prudently grow our vehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain times.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 01:19 PM\nSource:[TechSpot](https://www.techspot.com/news/105279-tesla-remains-track-produce-more-affordable-vehicles-first.html)\n\n**Tesla Removes Its Cheapest Car from the Market**\nTesla has removed its cheapest car, the Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, from the market with a retail price of $42,500.

Tesla also released its third-quarter delivery numbers, which included 462,890 vehicles delivered between July and September.

The recalls affected 200,000 vehicles in January, 2 million in February, 125,000 in May, 12,000 in June, 1.8 million in July, and 9,000 in August.

He also mentioned efforts to prevent military and veteran suicide, eliminate homelessness, and improve financial security for military families. Additionally, the President signed an Executive Order to support the economic security of military families and veterans' spouses, caregivers, and survivors. He emphasized that these actions are personal for him and his family, who have experienced the pride and pain of having a loved one serve in the military. The President called upon the people of the United States to honor veterans and military families with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 03:32 PM\nSource:[The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/10/31/a-proclamation-on-national-veterans-and-military-families-month-2024/)\n\n**'Biden Bucks' Could Change Elections Forever**\nThe Biden-Harris administration's Executive Order 14019 has been criticized as 'Biden Bucks' for its potential to alter the election process and favor Democrats. The order directs government agencies to promote voter registration and turnout, but critics argue that the implementation has been biased. Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for The Oversight Project, stated, 'If you target it neutrally, probably not the worst thing in the world. We want civic engagement in the country.' However, Brosnan also noted that the plans submitted by government agencies to promote voter registration have been largely shielded from the public, and that some agencies have partnered with liberal NGOs that push radical ideas such as noncitizen voting and felon voting. Brosnan said, 'They're actually implementing this executive order and putting their thumb on the scale for the federal government to support one candidate over another and juice turnout again.' The potential impact of 'Biden Bucks' on the 2024 presidential election could be significant, especially in Arizona and Michigan, where numerous infirmities in the U.S. election system could dramatically affect the election results.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 09:02 AM\nSource:[The Daily Signal](https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/10/31/biden-bucks-could-change-us-elections-forever/)\n\n**Darklore Depository 2024: A Halloween Inventory Of Federal Agency Guidance Documents**\nThe U.S. Federal Register has reached 86,712 pages, the third-highest annual count of all time, with two months yet to go. Federal agency guidance documents, including statements of policy, memoranda, and notices, are not reliably cataloged and archived. An informal inventory of these documents has uncovered 108,023. The Trump administration's Executive Order 13,891 required public disclosure of agency guidance documents, but this was revoked by the Biden administration. Some agencies continue to report guidance documents, while others have frozen or deleted their counts. The article highlights the challenges of tracking and categorizing guidance documents, with many agencies presenting 'indeterminate' tallies due to the complexity and ambiguity of their guidance.

The court denied the petition in the case of Keefer v. Biden without comment, with no dissenting judges. The order requires all federal agencies, including the prison system, to help increase voter registration and participation and promote mail-in voting. Critics say it will likely benefit Democrats more than Republicans. The main petitioner is Pennsylvania state Representative Dawn Keefer, a Republican. The 27 Republican state legislators from Pennsylvania challenged Biden's Executive Order 14019 of March 7, 2021, which requires all federal agencies to help increase voter registration and participation. They argued that the order was unconstitutional and that voter registration campaigns are not a legitimate function of government. They also challenged a voter registration order issued by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat. The legislators argued in their lawsuit that the executive actions violated their constitutional rights by usurping their power to prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections. Judge Jennifer Wilson of the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissed the lawsuit on March 26. 'The legislators were not legitimate to challenge an action that supposedly harmed the legislative assembly as a whole,' she wrote. 'They only alleged an institutional harm derived from a general loss of legislative power.' 'A vague and general allegation that elections, in general, will be undermined, is not the type of case or controversy that this court can pronounce on under Article III [of the US Constitution].' The legislators told the Supreme Court that they wanted an expedited consideration of the issue of standing, so if they prevail, 'they may obtain a preliminary injunction in the district court much before the November 2024 elections.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 03:34 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN ÉPOCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/corte-suprema-no-escuchara-impugnacion-orden-biden-registro-votantes-1311825.html)\n\n**Supreme Court won’t hear challenge to Biden voter registration order**\nThe Supreme Court has declined to hear a challenge from Pennsylvania Republican lawmakers to a Biden administration executive order aimed at boosting voter registration.

The task force, which will be responsible for developing a plan to combat machine gun conversion devices, has 90 days to issue a report. The executive order also seeks to crack down on 3D-printed guns and improve school active shooter drills. Biden said, 'The streets are flooded with machine gun conversion devices because the parts are small, cheap, and easy to make. The impact of these devices is devastating.' The task force will be composed of leaders from several federal departments and agencies. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said, 'We've been working with our U.S. attorney, with the Justice Department, to get machine gun conversions like Glock switches off our city streets.' Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'For as much as we have accomplished, more must be done. We need more leaders like the leaders in this room, in Congress, who have the courage to take action, to stand up to the gun lobby, and to put the lives of our children first.' The work may build on the administration's previous efforts to combat 'ghost guns.' 3D-printed firearms are typically produced at home with computer code downloaded from the internet and often lack a serial number, making them undetectable by law enforcement. Stefanie Feldman, the director of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, said, 'Some 3D-printed firearms can be made to be undetectable by magnetometers used to secure airports, courthouses and event spaces.' A second provision of the executive order aims to improve school-based active shooter drills, which have come under increasing scrutiny as parents, students, and educators say that some versions of the drills are traumatic.

According to Wiles, Trump will likely reinstate policies such as leaving the Paris climate agreement, withdrawing from the World Health Organization (WHO), and banning entry to citizens from predominantly Muslim countries. Trump also plans to revive the Schedule F initiative, which would remove job security from civil servants and enable them to be fired and replaced with right-wing loyalists. Wiles stated that Trump aims to transform the government in two years, rather than four, anticipating more political resistance in the second half of his term. Several of Trump's probable executive orders are likely to face legal challenge, including one revoking birthright citizenship and another banning schools from promoting critical race theory or transgender issues.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 04:33 PM\nSource:[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/trump-executive-orders)\n\n**Which Biden executive orders will be the first to go under Trump - Washington Examiner**\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has promised to undo many of the executive orders signed by President Joe Biden during his first eight days in office.

Trump is also expected to bring back the Remain in Mexico program for migrants seeking asylum and expedite permitting for fracking and drilling. However, Trump is unlikely to match Biden's pace of signing executive orders, and may not undo Biden's efforts to forgive student loans, according to CATO Institute scholar Andrew Gillen.

She emphasized that the 94 orders signed by Biden in his first week 'led to a crisis on the border and an economic crisis.' Leavitt added that Trump was re-elected to 'give a second chance to the orders that his administration's actions then gave.' Trump plans to close most of his federal cases, at least those opened against him. He may also begin the process of firing around 50,000 government employees, known as career officials who work under both Democratic and Republican presidents. Trump's plans also include introducing tariffs on imports, with proposed rates ranging from 10% to 60% on Chinese imports and 25% on Mexican imports.

The order is 95% complete and aims to be signed by President Joe Biden in early December, although some sources view it as 'pretty aspirational' given the president's impending departure. The order includes pilot programs for accelerating next-gen cyber defense AI models, transparency and deployment of secure software, and modernizing federal identity credentialing and access management. Cyber experts have differing views on the order's potential impact, with some questioning the value of additional tasks without funding guarantees and others seeing opportunities for AI to make a big difference in cybersecurity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 05:08 PM\nSource:[cyberscoop.com](https://cyberscoop.com/biden-cybersecurity-executive-order-ai-cloud-security-identity-credential/)\n\n**A Proclamation on National Veterans and Military Families Month, 2024 | The White House**\nPresident Joe Biden has proclaimed November 2024 as National Veterans and Military Families Month.

The order directs government agencies to promote voter registration and turnout, but critics argue that the implementation has been biased. Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for The Oversight Project, stated, 'If you target it neutrally, probably not the worst thing in the world. We want civic engagement in the country.' However, Brosnan also noted that the plans submitted by government agencies to promote voter registration have been largely shielded from the public, and that some agencies have partnered with liberal NGOs that push radical ideas such as noncitizen voting and felon voting. Brosnan said, 'They're actually implementing this executive order and putting their thumb on the scale for the federal government to support one candidate over another and juice turnout again.'

The court denied the petition in the case of Keefer v. Biden without comment, with no dissenting judges. The order requires all federal agencies, including the prison system, to help increase voter registration and participation and promote mail-in voting. Critics say it will likely benefit Democrats more than Republicans. The main petitioner is Pennsylvania state Representative Dawn Keefer, a Republican. The 27 Republican state legislators from Pennsylvania challenged Biden's Executive Order 14019 of March 7, 2021, which requires all federal agencies to help increase voter registration and participation. They argued that the order was unconstitutional and that voter registration campaigns are not a legitimate function of government. They also challenged a voter registration order issued by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat. The legislators argued in their lawsuit that the executive actions violated their constitutional rights by usurping their power to prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections. Judge Jennifer Wilson of the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissed the lawsuit on March 26. 'The legislators were not legitimate to challenge an action that supposedly harmed the legislative assembly as a whole,' she wrote. 'They only alleged an institutional harm derived from a general loss of legislative power.' 'A vague and general allegation that elections, in general, will be undermined, is not the type of case or controversy that this court can pronounce on under Article III [of the US Constitution].' The legislators told the Supreme Court that they wanted an expedited consideration of the issue of standing, so if they prevail, 'they may obtain a preliminary injunction in the district court much before the November 2024 elections.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 03:34 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN ÉPOCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/corte-suprema-no-escuchara-impugnacion-orden-biden-registro-votantes-1311825.html)\n\n**Supreme Court won’t hear challenge to Biden voter registration order**\nThe Supreme Court has declined to hear a challenge from Pennsylvania Republican lawmakers to a Biden administration executive order aimed at boosting voter registration.

The order directs government agencies to promote voter registration and turnout, but critics argue that the implementation has been biased. Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for The Oversight Project, stated, 'If you target it neutrally, probably not the worst thing in the world. We want civic engagement in the country.' However, Brosnan also noted that the plans submitted by government agencies to promote voter registration have been largely shielded from the public, and that some agencies have partnered with liberal NGOs that push radical ideas such as noncitizen voting and felon voting. Brosnan said, 'They're actually implementing this executive order and putting their thumb on the scale for the federal government to support one candidate over another and juice turnout again.' The potential impact of 'Biden Bucks' on the 2024 presidential election could be significant, especially in Arizona and Michigan, where numerous infirmities in the U.S. election system could dramatically affect the election results.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 09:02 AM\nSource:[The Daily Signal](https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/10/31/biden-bucks-could-change-us-elections-forever/)\n\n**As presidential election looms, disparate approaches to cyber policy come into focus**\nAs the November presidential election approaches, the US is on edge about potential changes in cyber policy. Despite the contrast between the two major candidates, there is a hope that the next administration will prioritize cybersecurity and maintain stability. Mark Montgomery, executive director of CSC 2.0, said, 'First and foremost, I think both potential administrations will take cybersecurity, and the need to protect our critical infrastructures in cyberspace, very seriously.' However, the candidates differ on the role of government in enforcing security policy and international cooperation. The US Chamber of Commerce expects a continuance of current cybersecurity policies, while advocating for a constructive cyber incident reporting program and regulatory harmonization legislation. Both major candidates have track records supporting cybersecurity efforts, with Trump signing an executive order in 2017 and Harris launching an eCrime unit and Privacy Enforcement and Protection Unit as California's attorney general. The Biden administration has taken steps to enhance cyber resilience, including transitioning to zero-trust security and rolling out sector-specific changes. Frank Cilluffo, director of the McCrary Institute, highlighted three high-priority recommendations for the next administration: conducting a comprehensive review of federal rules, developing a true level of cyberspace deterrence, and addressing the need to fill hundreds of thousands of job openings in the nation's cybersecurity workforce. Regardless of the outcome, cybersecurity must be a top priority, Cilluffo said. The future role of CISA is also a topic of partisan discussion, with some calling for significant changes or even dismantling the agency. Industry analysts emphasize the need for bipartisan cooperation to address cyber risks, citing the recent passage of the CIRCIA act as evidence of bipartisan agreement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 07:39 AM\nSource:[cybersecuritydive.com](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/white-house-election-trump-harris-cyber-policy/731593/)\n\n**Darklore Depository 2024: A Halloween Inventory Of Federal Agency Guidance Documents**\nThe U.S. Federal Register has reached 86,712 pages, the third-highest annual count of all time, with two months yet to go. Federal agency guidance documents, including statements of policy, memoranda, and notices, are not reliably cataloged and archived. An informal inventory of these documents has uncovered 108,023. The Trump administration's Executive Order 13,891 required public disclosure of agency guidance documents, but this was revoked by the Biden administration. Some agencies continue to report guidance documents, while others have frozen or deleted their counts. The article highlights the challenges of tracking and categorizing guidance documents, with many agencies presenting 'indeterminate' tallies due to the complexity and ambiguity of their guidance.

The court denied the petition in the case of Keefer v. Biden without comment, with no dissenting judges. The order requires all federal agencies, including the prison system, to help increase voter registration and participation and promote mail-in voting. Critics say it will likely benefit Democrats more than Republicans. The main petitioner is Pennsylvania state Representative Dawn Keefer, a Republican. The 27 Republican state legislators from Pennsylvania challenged Biden's Executive Order 14019 of March 7, 2021, which requires all federal agencies to help increase voter registration and participation. They argued that the order was unconstitutional and that voter registration campaigns are not a legitimate function of government. They also challenged a voter registration order issued by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat. The legislators argued in their lawsuit that the executive actions violated their constitutional rights by usurping their power to prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections. Judge Jennifer Wilson of the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissed the lawsuit on March 26. 'The legislators were not legitimate to challenge an action that supposedly harmed the legislative assembly as a whole,' she wrote. 'They only alleged an institutional harm derived from a general loss of legislative power.' 'A vague and general allegation that elections, in general, will be undermined, is not the type of case or controversy that this court can pronounce on under Article III [of the US Constitution].' The legislators told the Supreme Court that they wanted an expedited consideration of the issue of standing, so if they prevail, 'they may obtain a preliminary injunction in the district court much before the November 2024 elections.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 03:34 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN ÉPOCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/corte-suprema-no-escuchara-impugnacion-orden-biden-registro-votantes-1311825.html)\n\n**Supreme Court won't hear challenge to Biden voter registration order - Washington Examiner**\nThe Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from Pennsylvania GOP lawmakers challenging President Joe Biden's executive order on voter registration.

The lawmakers argued that the order was an unconstitutional attempt to influence the 2020 election and that the authority for regulating federal elections is solely vested in state legislatures. However, Chief Justice John Roberts previously addressed a similar argument in the 2023 case of Moore v. Harper, ruling that the Elections Clause does not insulate state legislatures from judicial review.

The order targets machine gun conversion devices and 3D-printed guns, which lack serial numbers and are difficult to trace. Biden also called for the expansion of federal law to ban devices like bump stocks, which increase a shooter's rate of fire but don't mechanically alter the gun. The order establishes an emerging firearms threats task force to assess the threat of 3D-printed guns and generate a report within 90 days. Additionally, the order aims to improve active school shooter drills by providing informational resources for schools to reduce and minimize trauma from shooter drills. Harris said, 'I believe the right to be safe is a civil right, and that the people of America have a right then, to live, work, worship and learn without fear of violence—including gun violence.'

Officials attribute this to an executive order issued by President Joe Biden. The White House reported a significant decrease in migrant encounters at the US-Mexico border since Biden's executive order to strengthen immigration law enforcement. The number of migrant encounters in August was significantly lower than the previous year, wrote White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández in a statement. Since Biden's executive order on June 4, there has been a 50% decrease in encounters at the border. According to US Customs and Border Protection, in August there were around 58,000 migrant encounters at ports of entry along the southern border, a nearly 68% decrease from the 181,000 in August 2023. The total number of encounters at the southern border was around 63,000. This number includes around 5,000 migrants who arrived at ports of entry without a CBP One registration. CBP One is a mobile app that allows migrants to schedule appointments at ports of entry instead of crossing illegally. US border officials said the app has played a crucial role in streamlining border processes. In August, around 44,700 people were processed through CBP One. Since its introduction in January 2023, over 813,000 people have scheduled appointments. US border officials also said that the June executive actions led to an increase in deportations of migrants, with over 131,000 people deported to more than 140 countries since June. Around 400 international repatriation flights have taken place during this time. However, even with the latest numbers, some Republican lawmakers criticized the Biden administration during a hearing on Thursday to discuss possible terrorist threats and national security issues related to illegal immigration. Lawmakers argued that the perception of border agents as welcoming, rather than focused on law enforcement, is contributing to the number of migrants arriving in the US. 'Our border patrol, our law enforcement agents were moved from their role of national security, their role of enforcing immigration law [to] repel illegal entry and capture those crossing illegally as much as possible to a kind of reception and care and transportation, food, etc.,' said Rep. Clay Higgins, a Republican from Alabama, expressing his concern about migrants crossing illegally and evading Border Patrol. There is no indication that the Biden administration has officially changed the role of Border Patrol agents in law enforcement. Alex Nowrasteh, vice president of economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, testified during the hearing that the main reason migrants come to the US, legally or illegally, is to work. 'It's still the economy. That's what attracts people, and the rapid economic recovery after COVID-19 may explain more than any other factor,' he said.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 08:36 PM\nSource:[Martí Noticias](https://www.martinoticias.com/a/la-casa-blanca-informa-caida-en-n%C3%BAmero-de-migrantes-que-intentan-cruzar-la-frontera/399576.html)\n\n**Nine months of progress – President Biden's Landmark AI Executive Order**\nIn the nine months since President Biden's Landmark Executive Order on AI, US federal agencies have made significant progress in achieving the directives set forth in the order.
