**Sadiq Khan leads backlash over Trump win as Ed Davey calls him 'dangerous'**
London Mayor Sadiq Khan expressed his concerns about Donald Trump's election, stating that many people around the world will be feeling 'fearful' due to the potential impact on democracy, women's rights, and the climate crisis. Khan said, 'The lesson of today is that progress is not inevitable.' Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey branded Trump a 'dangerous, destructive demagogue' and called the election a 'dark, dark day.' In contrast, PM Keir Starmer and Foreign Secretary David Lammy offered warm words, congratulating Trump on his victory and expressing their desire to work with him. Khan criticized Trump's attitudes towards Muslims and called for his visit to the UK to be cancelled, while Trump had previously described Khan as 'a stone cold loser' and 'very dumb.'

**Sadiq Khan warns London rough sleeping 'will get worse before it gets better' at emergency summit**
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned that rough sleeping in the city 'will get worse before it gets better' at an emergency summit on Tuesday. Khan announced £4.8m in funding to help previous rough sleepers stay off the streets for good, and will be joined by Minister for Homelessness and Rough Sleeping Rushanara Ali and other leaders to tackle the growing emergency. Khan has promised to 'set London on a course to end rough sleeping by 2030', but acknowledges that the situation may deteriorate further initially due to years of underinvestment in housing and support. A record 11,993 people were recorded sleeping rough in London between April 2023 and March 2024, a rise of almost 50 per cent since Khan became mayor in 2016. Khan has blamed the increase on Conservative policies, and has pointed out that his rough sleeping budget has increased from £8.45 million to £36.3 million over the past eight years. According to Khan's team, around 17,600 people have been helped off the capital's streets over the last eight years, with 75 per cent staying off the streets for good. Filmmaker Lorna Tucker-McGarvey, who slept on the streets of London as a teenager, said: 'I strongly believe that we can end rough sleeping with the right support, so I'm really pleased that the Mayor of London has convened today's emergency rough sleeping summit.'

**Homelessness in London 'will get worse before it gets better'**
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned that homelessness in the city will 'get worse before it gets better', despite the number of people sleeping on the streets hitting record levels. Khan has convened an 'emergency' summit to find long-term solutions to the crisis, and has reiterated his aim to end homelessness in London by 2030. However, he has also acknowledged that the 'scale of the challenge and legacy of previous Government underinvestment means things could get worse before they get better'. According to data, 11,993 people were seen rough sleeping in London in the year to March, and over 183,000 Londoners are estimated to be homeless and living in temporary accommodation. Khan has also announced a 'Homes off the Streets' initiative, with £4.8 million investment, to provide support for people previously sleeping rough in 3,500 long-term homes.

**Sadiq Khan slashes his minimum ask for transport funding ahead of Labour's Budget**
Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has reduced his minimum request for transport funding from the Labour Government to £250m, down from £569m last year. Khan believes that receiving anything more than £250m would be a 'win' due to the £22bn black hole in the public finances. He is also seeking a multi-year deal for funding beyond the 2025/26 financial year. Khan's previous requests were met with criticism, with some accusing him of making 'exaggerated financial demands'. The Labour Government's Budget will be set out on October 30.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan is 'confident' that Tube strikes planned by unions for November will be called off. Khan said Transport for London (TfL) is engaged in talks with both the RMT and Aslef unions and he is 'hopeful' that their demands can be negotiated 'amicably'. The mayor emphasized that 'the way to resolve these things is to get round the table and resolve them amicably', citing previous successful negotiations. Khan also addressed concerns about noise levels on the Victoria line, saying 'I understand the complaints they've got' and promising to work with the trade unions to resolve the issue. He noted that TfL has a £250m capital deal from the Government, but it is 'not enough' to cover the £2bn spent on capital each year.

**London Mayor Sadiq Khan Supports Discussion of UK's Potential Return to European Market**
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has stated that 'there's no need to be afraid' of discussing a possible return of the UK to the European market, one of the 'red lines' set by the new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in his proposal for a 'reset' of relations with the EU. Khan acknowledged that there is no option for a short-term return to the market, but emphasized that 'we have at our doorstep not only friends, companions, and family, but also a market of over 500 million people.' Khan also noted that Prime Minister Starmer has spent a significant portion of the past three months visiting European leaders, including the President of France, the Prime Minister of Italy, and the Chancellor of Germany. He expressed hope that the upcoming review of the Brexit agreement, scheduled for next year, will result in a greater affinity between the UK and the EU, and suggested that 'we should study a series of issues such as the mobility of young people, and see how we can bring people closer together.'

**Sadiq Khan piles pressure on Starmer over EU single market return**
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has stated that the UK's eventual return to the European Union's single market should not be ruled out, despite Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer making it a red line in his 'reset' talks with Brussels. Khan acknowledged that there is no short-term hope for rejoining the single market, but believes that barriers to trade with the UK's closest neighbours should come down. He also expressed support for a youth mobility scheme, which has been proposed by Brussels. In contrast, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has ruled out a return to the single market or customs union, and has no plans to sign up to a youth mobility scheme. Starmer acknowledged that Brexit has damaged the UK's international standing, and stated that the reset on the international stage must come alongside efforts to boost investment.

**London's Mayor Sadiq Khan Under Fire for Allowing Extremist Ads**
London's Muslim Mayor Sadiq Khan is facing criticism for allowing advertisements that promote Islamic extremism to be displayed throughout the city. The ads feature the 'ISIS finger' gesture and promote the teachings of Mufti Menk, a cleric who has been banned from entering Denmark and Singapore due to his hate speech. The ads also feature Khabib Nurmagomedov, a Russian MMA fighter, who is linked to the Russian warlord Ramsan Kadyrow. Khan has come under pressure to remove the ads, with many Londoners expressing outrage and the former Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, criticizing the ads as 'not in line with British culture'. Khan has promised to review the ads and take action against future problematic campaigns, stating that the city's government has a responsibility to ensure the public space is safe and respectful for all citizens.

**Sadiq Khan suffers blow as deputy mayor for policing and crime quits City Hall**
Sophie Linden, the Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime, is leaving City Hall after eight years in the £141,386-a-year post. She will become a senior adviser to the Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood. Linden's departure follows the departure of night tsar Amy Lame and is the third of Mr Khan's deputy mayors to leave in recent months. Mayor Sadiq Khan praised Linden's 'exceptional service' and said she had worked hard to ensure that London was 'tough on crime but also tackling its complex causes head on'. However, Linden's time in office saw the Met placed into special measures and hit by a series of scandals, including the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer. According to the Met's most recent statistics, gun crime is up 8.6 per cent year on year, robbery is up 11.4 per cent and shoplifting is up 45 per cent. Linden said it had been a 'huge privilege' to serve the capital and that policing in London is 'far more diverse, transparent and accountable than when I started'.

**Sadiq Khan’s night tsar to stand down from £132,000 role**
Amy Lamé, London's 'night tsar', has announced her resignation after eight years in the £132,000-a-year role. Lamé was appointed in 2016 to support London's nightlife, but her salary and perceived failure to stem venue closures have been criticized. Despite her efforts to improve women's safety and support night workers, over 3,000 venues have closed in London since the pandemic. Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, thanked Lamé for her service, while she expressed her pride in her accomplishments and her excitement to start her next chapter. Lamé will continue in the role until October 31, and it is unclear whether a successor will be appointed. 'It has been a huge honour to be London's – and the UK's – first-ever night tsar,' Lamé said. 'I believe that it is the right time for me to move on.'

**Sadiq Khan: I will 'keep lobbying' Keir Starmer to agree youth mobility deal with EU**
London Mayor Sadiq Khan is continuing to lobby Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for a youth mobility scheme with the EU, despite government resistance. Khan believes such a scheme would help address skill shortages in the capital and enable young people from the UK to live and work in the EU for a fixed period. He is also pushing for a shorter-term Erasmus scheme, similar to the old program, but with government support. Khan said, 'I think it's a great scheme, those below the age of 30 working in London and vice versa.' The EU Commission has proposed a visa scheme allowing European and UK citizens aged 18-30 to stay for up to four years in each other's countries, but no agreement has been reached. An unnamed EU official said, 'The Commission mainly wants to see if Starmer is willing to engage on the detail of a youth mobility scheme. If he shows a willingness to do so, that could unlock a lot of other 'low-hanging fruit' such as a defence deal.'

**Hate crime rise abhorrent, Sadiq Khan says**
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has condemned the rise in hate crime in London, particularly antisemitism and Islamophobia, as 'abhorrent and completely unacceptable'. He has announced a £875,000 investment in community projects to tackle hate, extremism, and radicalization, which will benefit around 50,000 Londoners. The funding comes ahead of the first anniversary of the outbreak of war in Gaza. The Met Police recorded a 286% rise in antisemitic hate crime and a 67% increase in anti-Muslim hate crime from September 2023 to August. Khan urged Londoners to remain united 'against all forms of hate' and to report any incidents of hate crime. He said, 'We have seen an abhorrent and completely unacceptable rise in hate crime over the last year – particularly antisemitism and Islamophobia – which has profoundly impacted our Jewish and Muslim communities in London.' Met Police Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist added, 'Together, we are determined to demonstrate that there will be no tolerance for hate crime in London.'

**Sadiq Khan fears rise in UK hate crime linked to Middle East violence**
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned of a potential increase in hate crime in Britain triggered by the rise in Middle East violence. Khan is pumping extra emergency funding into groups in London countering hate, following a series of Israeli airstrikes against targets in Lebanon. The Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Matt Twist said, 'As the situation in the Middle East becomes less certain once again, we know that fears and tensions will rise here at home too.' The Community Security Trust warned that Hezbollah and Iran may launch attacks against Jewish targets overseas as a way of seeking vengeance against Israel. Khan said, 'We know that an escalation in conflict in the Middle East often leads to an increase in hate crime here in London.' The Met recorded a 286% rise in antisemitic hate crime in the 12 months from September 2023 to August 2024, compared with the same period last year, and a 67% increase in anti-Muslim hate crime in the same period.

**Tories criticise Sadiq Khan for New York trip**
The Conservatives have criticized London's Labour mayor Sadiq Khan for attending a conference in New York City during the Labour party conference, saying he should be lobbying for more investment in the capital. Khan said he needed to 'bang the drum globally as well' and to bring in more foreign investment to London. The Tories on the London Assembly claimed the mayor had 'fled' to New York instead of making the case for the capital during a key gathering in the political calendar. Neil Garratt, the leader of the Tories on the London Assembly, said: 'Sadiq Khan has spent eight years blaming every problem on the government not giving him enough money, but last week Sir Keir Starmer told him clearly that Labour will not give him any more cash. 'With nowhere to hide from his own record of failure, Mayor Khan should face the facts and get on with the job of running London. Instead, he's fled to New York. London deserves so much better.' Khan is scheduled to give a speech or be a panellist at three separate conferences, two focused on climate change and one on business, and will also do a number of interviews with US press and broadcasters. He is visiting New York during the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, but is not thought to be attending the main event.

**No, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has not pledged to build 46,000 new homes ‘just for Muslims'**
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has been falsely accused of pledging to build 46,000 homes 'just for Muslims'. In reality, Khan said in an interview that he wants to build more homes in areas where people from minority communities, including Muslims, want to live, due to the lack of housing. He actually pledged to build at least 40,000 council homes and 6,000 rent control homes by 2030. Khan's spokesperson stated that claims of exclusive housing for Muslims are 'completely false'. This is not the first time Khan's comments have been misinterpreted online, with similar false claims made in May. Khan's Labour government has set a new target of 80,000 homes to be built in London annually, compared to 35,000 in 2023.

Anderson pointed to Khan's track record, citing a 21% increase in overall crime, 35% increase in violent crime, and 54% increase in knife crime. He also mocked Khan's concerns about his own safety, saying 'he's got bodyguards, armoured car, 24-hour security, he's in charge of the police – and he doesn't feel safe?' Anderson's comments were met with applause from the crowd, and it seems unlikely that the two will reconcile anytime soon.
