**Disney stock soared to a six-month high, looks to own the box office again**
Disney stock reached a six-month high after strong quarterly results, despite its recent film 'A Real Pain' performing poorly at the box office. The film, distributed by Disney's Searchlight Pictures, earned only $2.3 million in ticket sales. However, Disney investors are not concerned, as the studio is gearing up for two big holiday releases: 'Moana 2' and 'Mufasa: The Lion King'. The first trailer for 'Moana 2' reached 200 million views within its first day, a new record for a Disney animated film. Disney's ability to promote its films through its theme parks, network, and streaming products gives it an edge in the market. As a result, Disney shares are expected to continue to perform well.

**Disney Gets Ready to Own the Box Office Again | The Motley Fool**
Disney's box office performance has been slow lately, but it's not a cause for concern. The company's stock has soared to a six-month high after posting strong financial results, driven by a huge summer for its theatrical releases. Despite the lack of a blockbuster in theaters now, Disney still has two of the year's largest draws, Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine, which broke domestic records. The company's Searchlight Pictures released A Real Pain, which performed poorly, but this is typical for indie films. Disney is gearing up for two big holiday season releases, Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King, which are expected to be huge successes. The company's ecosystem, including its theme parks, network, and streaming products, makes it well-positioned to promote its biggest releases and attract audiences. As one analyst noted, 'Disney knows what it's doing.'

**Disney+ Surpasses 120 Million Subscribers, Exceeds Expectations**
Disney+ has surpassed 120 million subscribers, adding 4.4 million new subscribers in the last quarter. Approximately 60% of new Disney+ subscribers have chosen the ad-supported plan due to increased pricing strategies. The company reported a total revenue of $22.6 billion, a 6% increase year-over-year, and a net income of $460 million. CEO Bob Iger stated that about 60% of new Disney+ subscribers have opted for the ad-supported plan, driven by pricing strategies aimed at attracting more users to this model. The company acknowledged that advertiser interest in streaming and average revenue per user have grown, supporting this shift. Disney's film division had a remarkable success during the quarter, with 'Inside Out 2' and 'Deadpool & Wolverine' contributing to a business income of $316 million for content and licensing sales. The company expressed confidence in this momentum and expects strong performances during the holiday season with upcoming releases such as 'Moana 2' and 'Mufasa: The Lion King'. Disney reported a total revenue of $22.6 billion, a 6% increase year-over-year, and a net income of $460 million, exceeding analyst expectations. The free cash flow was $4 billion during the quarter. Looking ahead, Disney provided a guidance for earnings per share growth over the next three years, showing confidence in long-term prospects. However, a modest decline in Disney+ Core subscribers is expected in the next quarter due to the impact of the recent price increase.

**'Mufasa', the Prequel to Disney's 'The Lion King'**
The prequel to Disney's 'The Lion King', titled 'Mufasa', is set to hit theaters on December 19. Directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Berry Jenkins, the film tells the story of a young orphan named Mufasa and his encounter with Taka, the heir to a royal lineage. According to the film's narrative, Mufasa's journey is one of redemption and social ascension, as he rises from being an outcast to becoming the ancestor of Simba. As Berry Jenkins notes, 'Mufasa' is a story of a group of misfortunes searching for their destiny, and it serves as a precursor to the events of the original film. The movie features a stunning soundtrack by Lee Manuel Miranda and is a live-action adaptation of the 1994 animated classic, which grossed over $1.5 billion at the box office.

**‘Mufasa: O Rei Leão’: Duração do filme da Disney é REVELADA**
The Disney movie 'Mufasa: The Lion King' is expected to have a runtime of 1h58min, according to AMC Theatres. This is the same runtime as the 2019 live-action film. The movie is expected to gross $59-66 million in its first weekend in the US, according to Deadline. The 2019 live-action film grossed $191.7 million in its opening weekend and $1.66 billion worldwide. The movie is a prequel to the 2019 live-action film and follows the story of Mufasa as a young orphaned lion who befriends a friendly lion named Taka. The film is directed by Barry Jenkins, who won an Oscar for 'Moonlight: Under the Light of the Moon'. As Jenkins said, 'Mufasa: The Lion King' 'invites Rafiki to share the legend of Mufasa with young lion Kiara, daughter of Simba and Nala, with Timon and Pumbaa lending their signature. Told in flashbacks, the story presents Mufasa as an orphaned, lost, and alone cub until he meets a friendly lion named Taka - the heir to a royal lineage. Their bonds will be tested as they work together to escape a threatening and deadly enemy.'

**Disney's New Lion King Movie Gets Worrying Box Office Projection**
Disney's upcoming movie, Mufasa: The Lion King, is expected to open between $59 million and $66 million over the three-day opening weekend, according to Quorum tracking service. This is a significant step-down from its 2019 predecessor, which opened to $191 million. The movie is a prequel and sequel to The Lion King, and is set to be released on the same weekend as Star Wars and Avatar films. Mufasa: The Lion King is tracking well with female audience members and older moviegoers, and is expected to tap into the nostalgia of those who have fond memories of the 1994 animated The Lion King. However, it will face competition from Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which is skewing more male and aiming for a younger audience.

**Mufasa: King of the Lion' Faces Disappointing Box Office Predictions**
The upcoming film 'Mufasa: King of the Lion' is expected to have a disappointing box office performance, according to Deadline's predictions. The movie is estimated to start with a US box office of $59-66 million, significantly lower than the success of the 2019 'The Lion King' remake, which started with $190 million and grossed $1.6 billion worldwide. The low expectations are attributed to Disney's focus on promoting 'Moana 2' and the fact that prequels often fail to match the success of their originals. Additionally, 'Mufasa' will be competing with 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3', which also targets a young audience. Analysts suggest that parents choosing a family movie will be influenced by their children's preferences and personal interests, with 'The Lion King' having a larger female fan base and 'Sonic' appealing more to men. As D23 convention in Brazil showcased the film's final trailer, the competition is expected to be fierce.

**‘Mufasa: The Lion King’ Set to Roar with $66M+ Opening Weekend**
Disney's highly anticipated animated prequel, Mufasa: The Lion King, is projected to pull in between $59 million and $66 million in its opening weekend, according to early data from Quorum tracking service. The film, directed by Barry Jenkins, arrives in cinemas on December 20, 2024, setting it up for a holiday season release. Marketing efforts are expected to intensify in the weeks leading up to the release, with a 'box office perfect storm' of concurrent releases from other major studios. Quorum's 'Pay to See' scale shows promising results for Mufasa, with a score of 62, indicating high box office demand. The film is expected to resonate with female viewers and an older demographic, particularly those over the age of 35, and boasts a compelling voice cast featuring talents like Aaron Pierre, Donald Glover, and Seth Rogen. A strategic December release date is well-timed to capitalize on peak holiday theater attendance, with the potential for a 5-6x multiplier on its opening numbers.

**The Lion King Sequel: A Potential Blockbuster from Disney**
Disney has released the final trailer for the sequel to 'The Lion King,' which could potentially surpass the success of 'Toy Story 2' and 'Deadpool 3.' The original remake, released in 2019, earned $1.662 billion and is one of the most successful Disney films of all time. The new trailer showcases the film's grandeur, and considering the success of the first part, it's possible that the prequel about Mufasa will become the most successful family film in Disney's history. The unique aspect of the new versions of 'The Lion King' is that they differentiate themselves from the originals through modern re-imaginings while still capturing the magic of the world. The film is a 'live-action' remake with computer-generated characters, which may seem like a contradiction, but has proven to be a genius decision. A 3D animated remake would have lost the film's charm, and a live-action version with animated animal faces would have been quirky rather than enchanting. The new look and aesthetic of the film are both majestic and organic, setting it apart from Hollywood's generic style. 'Mufasa: The Lion King' will be released in German cinemas on December 19, 2024, as a big Christmas film. Will you watch the prequel to the potentially best animated Disney film, or wait until it's available for free on Disney Plus?

**‘Moana 2’ Could Surpass ‘Funny Girl 2’ at the Box Office, Projections Suggest**
Despite recent box office disappointments like 'The Joker: Folie à Deux' and 'Venom: The Last Stand', the end-of-year holidays are approaching, and may be boosted by solid earnings from titles like 'Moana 2', 'Mufasa: The Lion King', and 'Wicked'. According to Adam Aron, CEO of AMC, some people in the industry are saying that 'Moana 2' could even surpass the success of 'Funny Girl 2'. 'Funny Girl 2' had the second-highest opening of 2024 for Walt Disney Studios, earning $154.2 million. Recent projections suggest that 'Moana 2' could earn over $100 million during the five-day window between Wednesday and Sunday in the week of Thanksgiving, as well as $75-82 million between Friday and Sunday. The first chapter of the franchise opened with $82 million in five days, eventually earning $248.7 million at the domestic box office. Additionally, the musical adaptation of 'Wicked' is expected to earn $80 million in its pre-Thanksgiving opening weekend, followed closely by the anticipated 'Gladiator II', with $65 million. 'Moana 2' will hit theaters nationwide on November 28. The film reunites Moana and Maui three years after their first adventure, for a new expansive journey alongside an unlikely crew of sailors. After receiving an unexpected call from their ancestors, Moana must travel to the distant oceans of Oceania and into long-lost waters to face a new and different adventure than she has ever faced before. The film is directed by Dave Derrick Jr. with music by Abigail Barlow, Emily Bear, Opetaia Foa'i, and Mark Mancina.

**'Vaiana 2' Could Surpass 'Del Revés 2' at the Box Office**
Disney believes that 'Vaiana 2' could surpass the success of 'Del Revés 2' (Inside Out 2) at the box office. According to Deadline, Adam Aron, CEO of AMC Theatres, is convinced that the upcoming releases of 'Vaiana 2', 'Wicked', and 'Mufasa: El Rey León' will push the US box office revenue for 2024 to over $9 billion. He also stated, 'Some people who know the topic tell me that 'Vaiana 2' could even eclipse the success of 'Del revés 2'. This would mean surpassing the $653 million achieved by the sequel of 'Inside Out' in the domestic market, with $154.2 million of them in its opening weekend, making it the second-best release of the year, just behind 'Deadpool y Lobezno', which made $211.4 million in its first weekend. The predictions were already good, with forecasts of $100 million in domestic box office revenue in the first 5 days of 'Vaiana 2', surpassing the $82 million achieved by the original in 2016.

**What Venom 3's Box Office Means For Sony's Next 2024 Marvel Movie**
Venom: The Last Dance's box office performance suggests that Sony's next Marvel movie, Kraven the Hunter, has a chance to be successful. Despite a disappointing opening weekend, the film is holding up better than expected in its second weekend, earning $26.1 million and topping the weekend box office charts. The film's success is a positive sign for the Sony Spider-Man Universe, which has been a mixed bag since 2018's Venom. However, Kraven the Hunter faces tough competition during the holiday season, including The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim and Mufasa: The Lion King. The film's R rating could also affect its box office, as families are looking for family-friendly entertainment during the holidays. Nevertheless, Kraven the Hunter has a talented cast and crew, and positive word-of-mouth could help it perform well at the box office.

The release faces competition from Mufasa: The Lion King and Sonic the Hedgehog 3, but Focus Features' marketing decisions have been praised for not revealing the monster too soon. As one writer noted, 'Is it December yet? I need this movie in front of my eyes immediately, please, and thank you.' Nosferatu is set to be released on December 25, 2024.
