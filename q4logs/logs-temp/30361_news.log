**How far have mortgage interest rates fallen in 2024?**
Mortgage interest rates in 2024 have not fallen significantly, despite initial hopes for a downward trajectory. According to historical Bankrate data, the average 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate was 6.96% on January 3, 2024. It dropped to 6.84% by the end of the month, but then ticked up to 7.13% in February. Rates fluctuated throughout the year, with a notable drop to 6.15% on September 18, a 2-year low, ahead of the official Fed rate cut. However, since then, rates have been on an upward trend, hitting 7% on November 6. As of November 20, the rate was 6.91%, just five basis points lower than January's rate. The potential for rates to increase again in 2025 is strong, with factors like inflation, unemployment, and the 10-year Treasury yield all playing a role. It's essential to check mortgage interest rates daily for opportunities to capitalize on a lower rate when it's available.

**US yields rise, Fed policy in focus**
US Treasury yields rose on Wednesday, with benchmark 10-year yields consolidating near a five-month high. Investors are waiting for clarity on President-elect Donald Trump's policies and upcoming jobs and inflation data to inform Federal Reserve policy. A strong November jobs report could add to bets that the Fed is nearing a rate cutting pause. Traders are pricing in a 59% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut in December and a 15% chance of another cut in January. The yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes steepened by 1 basis point to 12 basis points. The Treasury Department will sell $16 billion in 20-year bonds and $17 billion in 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities this week. As Michael Lorizio, head of U.S. rates trading at Manulife Investment Management, said, 'It seems like we're going to have to wait until the next nonfarm payroll release and the next CPI release to really see how that informs the Fed.'

**Why are mortgage rates rising again?**
Mortgage rates have risen to 6.90%, their highest level since July, due to growing concerns about future inflation. The 30-year-fixed rate has increased from 6.86% a week earlier, and overall mortgage loan application volume has ticked up by 1.7% on a weekly basis. Andrew Krei, co-chief investment officer for Crescent Grove Advisors, attributes the rise in mortgage rates to the increase in 10-year Treasury yields since the Federal Reserve began slashing interest rates. He notes that the bond market is signaling risks around growth and inflation, which filters into the mortgage market. Despite the Federal Open Market Committee's interest rate cuts, mortgage rates have reversed their decline and are expected to remain high due to a lack of housing supply and sticky inflation in the shelter sector.

**Daily Spotlight: Yield Curve Returns to Normal Slope**
The yield curve has returned to its normal upward-sloping shape after almost two years of inversion, according to recent data. This change has significant implications for bond investors and the economic outlook. The yield curve's shift is attributed to positive U.S. economic trends, a decrease in deflation fears, and the Federal Reserve's ability to lower short-term rates. As a result, rates at the long end of the yield curve have increased, and the curve is expected to continue steepening in the next few quarters. As one might expect, this change has led to a decrease in the gap between fed funds and core PCE, allowing the Fed to focus on pushing inflation back toward 2.0%.

**Russian Government Bond Index (RGBI) Falls Below 100 Points**
The Russian Government Bond Index (RGBI) has fallen below 100 points for the first time since November 13, 2024, after four trading sessions above 100 points. The index has decreased by 0,77% and is currently trading at 99,92 points, according to data from 10:20 Moscow time. Igor Galaktionov, an analyst at Alfa-Investments, believes that the correction in long-term OFZs is logical in light of new data on inflation expectations. 'Expectations remain at the level of October: 13.4% is the maximum since the beginning of the year. The Central Bank representative once again mentioned that for the resumption of disinflation, additional tightening of monetary conditions is required. This means that the probability of another key rate hike at the December meeting is growing,' he added. The inverted yield curve of OFZs continues to show higher yields for short-term and medium-term bonds compared to longer-term bonds. The highest yield on the market (21.52-21.55% per annum) is offered by the shortest issues - up to six months. Longer issues with maturity up to two years offer a yield of 20.62-21.44%, while the longest OFZs with a 30-year maturity offer a yield of 14.13% per annum.

**US long-dated yields dip as investors consolidate positions ahead...**
US Treasury yields fell on the long end of the curve on Friday as investors consolidated positions ahead of a long weekend, following Republican Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election. The 10-year yield dropped 2.7 basis points to 4.316%, while the 30-year yield fell 5.7 basis points to 4.486%. This was the largest weekly drop for both yields since early September. Analysts attribute the decline to 'buy the rumor, sell the fact' event, where investors sold Treasuries before the election and then bought them back after the outcome was known. Additionally, the cooler-than-expected one-year inflation print and the Fed's decision to lower the fed funds target rate also contributed to the decline. Rate futures have priced in one rate cut in December and two in 2025. 'The market has done a very good job of anticipating the outcome and pricing them in,' said Brendan Murphy, head of fixed income at Insight Investment. 'And then you get position-squaring in the aftermath of it, causing a near-term reversal,' Murphy added.

**U.S. Global Investors Reports Profitability for the First Quarter of 2025 Fiscal Year - US Global Investors (NASDAQ:GROW), U.S. Global Jets ETF (ARCA:JETS)**
U.S. Global Investors, Inc. reported a net income of $315,000, or $0.02 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $176,000 in the same quarter a year earlier. The company's average assets under management (AUM) for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, were $1.5 billion, a decrease of $640 million, or 30%, from the same quarter a year earlier. CEO Frank Holmes attributed the challenge of turning operating income from negative to positive to fund flows into the company's thematic, cyclical products. He also noted that the inverted yield curve, which has been one of the most reliable recession indicators over the last 50 years, has kept many investors on the sidelines. Despite this, the company remains optimistic about industry inflows recovering post-election. The company has also authorized a monthly dividend of $0.0075 per share through December 2024 and plans to buy back up to approximately 14% of its shares outstanding.

**The Secret To Stocks’ Success And Why That Recession Still Hasn’t Happened**
The US stock market has been resilient in recent years, despite predictions of a recession. Two recession indicators, the inverted yield curve and the Sahm Rule, have been proven wrong. The inverted yield curve, which typically signals a slowing economy, has been inverted since 2022 but has not led to a recession. The Sahm Rule, which suggests that a recession is imminent if the unemployment rate rises by half a percentage point, also failed to predict a recession. Instead, the US economy has continued to grow, driven by productivity gains and central bank and government stimulus. Economists credit the stimulus, including near-zero interest rates and massive bond-purchase programs, with helping the countries bounce back from downturns. The article suggests that investors should consider a diversified approach to their portfolio, including the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, the S&P Equal Weight ETF, and the Finimize Easy Rider Model Portfolio. 'It's always a good reminder that time in the market and not timing the market is what matters in building wealth.'

**End of Yield Curve Inversion Isn't the Economic Relief It Seems | Investing.com UK**
The author believes that the end of the yield curve inversion is not a sign of economic relief, but rather a warning sign of potential economic troubles. They point out that the media has been misleading the public by saying that all's clear economically, but the author's view is based on historical facts that show that the clock starts ticking on economic troubles after the inversion ends and during the new steepener. The author notes that the stock market is out of touch with reality and that the sector employment data from Friday's Payrolls post shows that if not for government intervention, the reading would have been a negative print. They also mention that the Manufacturing sector is dropping into recession and that risk should be managed carefully, especially with the potential for shorting being a rewarding strategy well into 2025.

**Global inverted yield curves 2023**
As of April 25, 2023, 30 economies reported a negative value for their ten-year minus two-year government bond yield spread. This phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve or negative yield curve, is often considered a main indicator of an impending recession. According to experts, this situation reflects an underlying belief among investors that short-term interest rates are about to fall, driving down the yield on long-term debt. In the United States, an inverted yield curve has preceded almost all recent recessions, with the exception of the COVID-19 pandemic. The onset of the pandemic saw stock markets crash, leading to a surge in government debt purchases, resulting in negative yields for many countries. However, investors calculated that the small loss on stable bonds was less than the losses likely to occur on the market, and that the bonds may be sold at an even higher price if conditions continue to deteriorate.

**Laufzeiten-ETFs: How to Secure High Yields**
The normalcy returned to the German bond market on a Monday in September. Since then, the yield of short-term German bonds has been lower than that of long-term bonds for the first time in two years. This breaks the golden rule of investing, where long-term investments in fixed-income securities are expected to yield higher returns than short-term ones. However, in the fall of 2022, this rule was reversed, with 10-year German bonds offering lower yields than 2-year ones. Financial experts refer to this phenomenon as an inverted yield curve.

**Why has the inverted yield curve failed? A fundamentals-based explanation**
Prof. Menzie Chinn at Econbrowser proposed supplementing the yield curve with the private nonfinancial debt service ratio to improve recession forecasting. However, the author of this post is concerned about the 'just so' nature of this indicator and instead offers a fundamentals-based explanation for why the inverted yield curve has failed to predict a recession. The author suggests that the traditional explanation for the inverted yield curve, which is based on banks tightening lending conditions, may not be accurate in today's economy. Instead, the author points to supply chain tightness and the interest earned by banks on their Fed reserve deposits as key factors. The author notes that the supply chain index has returned to normal, leading to a sharp shift in the supply curve and a decline in commodity prices. Additionally, the interest earned by banks on their Fed reserve deposits has been higher than their CD rates, making it less likely for banks to tighten lending conditions. The author concludes that the inverted yield curve has failed to predict a recession because of these economic fundamentals and provides testable predictions for the future.

**Investing in Turbulent Times**
As the European Central Bank (BCE) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) begin to lower interest rates, the second half of 2024 is expected to bring a return to normalcy in the yield curve. After years of flat or inverted yield curves, it's essential to remember that a positive-sloping curve is the norm. The recent decline in interest rates and contained inflation have led to the US 10-year debt paying more than the 2-year debt, a phenomenon not seen since July 2022. This means that lending money for longer periods should offer higher returns, which is the norm, but not what we're accustomed to. The journey from negative interest rates to a positive-sloping curve has not been easy for asset managers, but it has also presented many opportunities for investment. The recent market fluctuations have affected not only fixed-income assets but also equities, particularly in sectors dependent on long-term growth expectations, such as technology. As the year comes to a close, volatility is expected, which will create opportunities that must be seized. To maximize these opportunities, it's essential to stay close to the market. The rotation in our portfolios, whether by increasing the percentage allocated to fixed income or variable income, or by moving within these categories, has added extra points of return to our portfolios. However, for a traditional investor, it's challenging to dedicate the time and resources needed to navigate the complex market landscape, especially considering the behavioral biases we all face. To address this, it's essential to know when to enter and exit the market, as well as the optimal allocation to different sectors and asset types, without forgetting the return of mixed portfolios to take advantage of the bond-bond disconnection, which will allow us to assume exposure to variable income while mitigating volatility.

The Conference Board's composite index of leading indicators for the US economy fell by 0.5% in September, exceeding expectations. Over the six-month period from March to September 2024, the index declined by 2.6%, a sharper drop than the 2.2% observed in the previous six-month period. The Conference Board attributes the weakness to new industrial orders, the inverted yield curve, decline in building permits, and consumer pessimism about future business conditions.

**This Reliable Recession Indicator Recently Did Something for the First Time in 793 Days -- It Could Trigger a Big Move in the Stock Market**
The yield curve, a key economic indicator, recently did something for the first time in 793 days, which could signal a big move in the stock market. The yield curve plots the yields of Treasury bills of different maturities and has an inverse relationship with Treasury bills. An inverted yield curve suggests the economy is in trouble, but the recent inversion reversal has been reliable in predicting a recession. However, historical data shows that the yield curve's inversion reversal hasn't always triggered a recession. The economy is dealing with unprecedented factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Fed's massive balance sheet, making it difficult to predict the future. Investors should still assume a small probability of a recession and prepare accordingly.

The yield curve, a key economic indicator, recently did something for the first time in 793 days, which could signal a big move in the stock market. The yield curve plots the varying yields of Treasury bills of different maturities and has an inverse relationship with Treasury bills. An inverted yield curve suggests the economy is in trouble, but the recent uninversion of the curve in early September has sparked concerns about a potential recession. Historically, each of the last four recessions began about three to six months after the yield curve was uninverted. However, the economy appears to be hanging in, with a low unemployment rate and decreasing inflation. While the yield curve's inversion reversal has been reliable, it hasn't always triggered a recession, and the economy is dealing with unprecedented factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Fed's massive balance sheet. Investors should be aware of the possibility of a recession and prepare accordingly.

**The Yield Curve Inversion: A Signal for Recession?**
The inversion of the yield curve, a phenomenon where long-term bond yields are lower than short-term bond yields, is a signal that a recession is likely. Historically, this has been a reliable indicator of a recession in the US. However, some economists argue that this time may be different, citing the strong stock market and the Fed's efforts to maintain a 'good' economy. Gary Shilling, a well-known economist, believes in the predictive power of the yield curve, but warns that the recent inversion does not necessarily mean a severe recession. Others, like David Rosenberg, think that a recession is likely and that the yield curve is a reliable indicator. The disagreement among economists is reflected in the different yield curves that are being watched, with some focusing on the 2-year vs 10-year bond yield and others on the 3-month vs 10-year bond yield. The Goldman Sachs investment strategy team is watching four different yield curves, but does not consider a recession to be the base scenario. 'The question is whether the inversion is due to the Fed's plan for a soft landing or is the Fed just behind the curve?' asks Brett Nelson of Goldman Sachs. The reasons for this time being different include the severity of the inflation caused by the pandemic, the tech bubble in 2000, and the Chinese and Japanese markets in 2006. 'The history casts a long shadow. Ironically, the problem is that people continue to think about the historical shadow of the inverted yield curve rather than paying attention to the short-term dynamics,' says Fred Carstensen, an economic historian at the University of Connecticut. While economists debate, investors must put their money to work hoping that their failure will not be too severe, whichever side is right. 'The recession has been delayed, but no, we don't think it will be avoided,' says Bryan Whalen, chief investment officer of the asset management company TCW. 'If we make a mistake and we have a soft landing, there is not much room for upside – credit spreads are 'tight'. If we are right, it will be a big gain for us. These are good odds'.

**The yield curve dilemma: Inflation, investor caution and the prospect of rate cuts**
India's yield curve has experienced significant shifts in recent years, driven by factors such as rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), geopolitical tensions, and global investor sentiment. The curve has inverted, with short-term yields surpassing long-term ones, raising concerns about a potential economic slowdown. However, with inflation moderating, speculation is growing around potential rate cuts to ease investor caution and restore a more typical yield curve. Mansi Kariya, co-fund manager at PPFAS AMC, notes that if inflation continues to stabilize below 4%, it would pave the way for the RBI to consider reducing interest rates, potentially leading to a return to an upward-sloping yield curve and stronger economic conditions.

**Market Risk Is Building Despite the Yield Curve Un-Inverting**
The market risk is building despite the yield curve un-inverting, which some may see as a sign that a recession is unlikely. However, history suggests that it's not the inversion that kills the boom, but the subsequent steepener. The author notes that the setup projects an epic heartbreak for those who have been FOMO-ing (fear of missing out) and MOMO-ing (momentum following momentum) the market, thinking that the yield curve un-inversion eliminates the recession signal. The author emphasizes the importance of being aware of the risk signals and accepting that risk, as the clock is ticking and past facts of history may extrapolate to a coming fact of realized risk. The author also mentions that they are watching events closely and have been compelled to lean bullish all year long, but are now expecting rotations to include commodity and resources related areas.

**'Phenomenal' receptivity: Canada's high-yield bond market is suddenly the hottest in years**
Canada's high-yield debt market is experiencing a surge in activity, with companies raising around $9.8 billion through non-investment-grade debt sales so far this year, the second-fastest pace of issuance in Bloomberg records. This trend is driven by relatively cheap funding and investors looking to lock in coupons before central bank monetary policy easing takes hold. Sean St. John, executive vice-president and managing director at National Bank Financial, stated, 'Investor receptivity has been phenomenal.' Companies are taking advantage of the low funding costs and inverted yield curve to term out short-dated bank debt into the high-yield market. High-yield coupons have compressed so much that they've become relatively competitive with bank loan pricing, making it an attractive option for issuers. For buyers, the enthusiasm comes from expectations that interest rates have peaked and the time to lock in yield is now.

**A Recession Might Be Closer Than You Think**
The S&P 500 Index has been making new highs, but a recession might be closer than you think. The yield curve, a reliable gauge of recessions, inverted back in 2022, but we haven't seen a recession yet. The author's twist on this metric is to look at the yield curve's un-inversion, which has preceded past recessions. The curve has officially un-inverted, and long-term yields have remained higher than short-term yields over the past couple of weeks. Historically, stocks don't necessarily plummet right away after a yield un-inversion, but returns are not great five to 10 months later. The author advises having an exit plan in place for when the tide inevitably turns and holding cash to buy great companies on the cheap when the markets do plunge. A Wall Street veteran, Marc Chaikin, also sees warning signs in the market and has created a tool to help everyday investors figure out which sectors will outperform and which ones will be crushed once this shift in the market begins.

**Janus Henderson Mortgage-Backed Securities ETF Q2 2024 Commentary**
The Janus Henderson Mortgage-Backed Securities ETF (JMBS) experienced a volatile quarter due to changing expectations for future rate cuts. Despite this, the ETF's performance was positive, with a 0.23% return at NAV and 0.32% return at market price. The Bloomberg U.S. Mortgage Backed Securities Index returned 0.07%. The manager believes that the overall level of rate volatility is likely to decrease once the Fed starts cutting rates, which should be positive for the MBS market. They also expect the inverted yield curve to normalize, which has historically been positive for agency MBS. The manager's strategic overweight to higher-coupon bonds and allocation to non-agency mortgages with strong fundamentals contributed to the ETF's performance. They anticipate origination to remain muted in the near term due to high mortgage rates, but believe the supply outlook for MBS is positive and should provide support to spread levels. The manager also expects lower prepayment rates due to the Federal Housing Finance Agency's approval of Freddie Mac's second-lien program. As the economy gradually slows, the manager believes that the Fed will start cutting rates, which will be positive for fixed income markets. They recommend adding duration to MBS to provide defensive characteristics for portfolios if economic growth slows more than expected.

**Will the ECB be forced to follow the Fed?**
The Eurozone economy is faltering, with weak PMI data for France and Germany, increasing the chance of a recession in Germany. The German yield curve dis-inverted, indicating investors are concerned about the European economy and expect the ECB to cut interest rates faster than initially thought. The market now sees a 40% chance of an October rate cut from the ECB, up from 25% on Friday. French bond yields are also showing signs of strain, with the spread vs. Germany widening. The ECB may be forced to follow the Fed's lead and cut interest rates more aggressively to protect the European economy from a harsh downturn. The euro is the second worst performing currency in the G10 FX space, and EUR/GBP has plunged to its lowest level since 2022, with a break below £0.8350 potentially leading to a deeper decline.
