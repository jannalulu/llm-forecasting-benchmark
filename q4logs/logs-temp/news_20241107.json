According to Layoffs.Fyi, 457 tech companies have laid off 139,534 employees since the start of 2024. Companies like Microsoft, Google, Northvolt, Apple, IBM, Intel, Dell, and Luminar have implemented silent layoffs. The report highlights that companies use techniques like 'Work From Office' mandates to trigger job cuts without making official announcements. For example, Amazon's 5-day return-to-office mandate has led to nearly 1,900 employees looking for job changes. Google's 2023 layoffs, announced through a 2 AM email, became a PR nightmare and attracted negative press. The report notes that silently laying off employees does not affect the remaining staff and is a way for companies to avoid making headlines.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 06:12 AM\nSource:[latestly.com](https://www.latestly.com/technology/silent-layoffs-surge-in-silicon-valley-as-tech-giants-aim-to-avoid-bad-press-adopt-techniques-like-work-from-office-to-trigger-job-cuts-report-6323276.html)\n\n**Tech Layoffs In September: Microsoft, Udemy, Dozee Fires Thousands Of Employees**\nAfter a significant surge in tech layoffs in August, September saw a decline with 30 companies laying off 3,765 employees.

Cisco also announced a 7% reduction in its workforce, affecting around 5,600 employees, citing the need to invest in growth opportunities and enhance efficiency. Experts suggest that it will be some time before the tech industry recovers from these layoffs.

Companies such as Tesla, Amazon, Google, TikTok, Snap, and Microsoft have made significant layoffs in the first months of 2024. Even smaller startups have seen a considerable number of layoffs, and in some cases, have shut down operations entirely. The reason for the layoffs is the focus on artificial intelligence, which is accompanied by an increasing attention to costs. The layoffs in 2024 are targeted at sectors that are less profitable. According to McKinsey, by 2030, at least 14% of workers may need to change jobs due to digitalization, robotics, and artificial intelligence. The first companies that can afford to take this path are those that control, to a large extent, the development of the technologies they themselves must use. This is the necessary choice that guides the organizational restructuring that will lead to an increase in employees in more innovative areas and a reduction in employment in less profitable areas.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 10:20 AM\nSource:[Key4biz](https://www.key4biz.it/i-licenziamenti-nel-settore-tech-non-si-fermano-nel-2024-oltre-139mila-tagli-anche-colpa-dellai/506304)\n\n**Massive layoffs in tech industry: Over 100000 jobs eliminated at firms including Microsoft, IBM**\nThe tech industry has seen a surge in layoffs, with companies like IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, and Dell implementing job cuts as part of their restructuring efforts. IBM's recent layoffs target senior programmers, sales staff, and support personnel, aiming to reduce a small percentage of its global workforce.

In contrast, the IT services sector is projected to see a significant rebound in fresh hiring during the fiscal year 2025, with entry-level hires expected to nearly double, reaching over 150,000 new positions.

Microsoft has laid off 650 employees from its Xbox gaming division, and Qualcomm has announced that it will lay off 226 employees in San Diego. Despite these cuts, the IT services sector is expected to see a significant rebound in fresher hiring during FY25, with industry projections indicating that entry-level hires will nearly double, reaching over 150,000 new positions. Experts attribute this rebound to strong deal wins, global expansion by Indian IT majors, and increasing demand in sectors like banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI).

This brings the total number of layoffs in the gaming division to 1900, including those from Activision Blizzard. The CEO of Microsoft Gaming, Phil Spencer, stated that the decision was made to align the team structure post-acquisition and reorganize the activity for long-term success. This strategy is not unique to Microsoft, as seen in the case of Wetransfer, which was acquired by Bending Spoons and is now undergoing a 75% reduction in staff.

The analysts argue that the trend of payroll numbers dropping below expectations is a sign of normalization, but the tech layoffs are seen as a red flag. The decisions could have ripple effects outside of the tech sector and impact other shifts in the market. As of September 9, more than 212,000 people have been impacted by layoffs in 2024, with major vendors like Intel, Dell, and Microsoft cutting thousands of jobs. Smaller companies in the channel have also followed this trend, with Five9 cutting 180 jobs in late August. 'What caught our attention was the spike in layoffs for technology companies which wasn't as bad as those seen in late 2022 and early 2023, but otherwise rivals some of the worst spikes this industry has seen over time,' RBC's analysts wrote.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2024 12:09 PM\nSource:[ITPro Today](https://www.itprotoday.com/career-management/tech-sector-layoffs-rival-worst-spikes-over-time)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The company, backed by Advent International and KKR & Co., has begun discussing a listing with potential advisers for 2025. However, no final decision has been made, and NielsenIQ could opt to remain private. The IPO would come amid a rebound in US IPOs and rising consumer confidence, with this year's IPOs on US exchanges up 64% to almost $40 billion compared to the same period last year.

According to TechCrunch, Friedman stated that companies want to have 12 months of strong performance before going public, and the current cost of capital environment has made it difficult for companies to go public. However, recent public offerings in the biotech sector have demonstrated an appetite for younger companies, such as Tempus AI and Bicara Therapeutics. Some startups, including Stripe, OpenAI, and SpaceX, have chosen to remain private longer and conduct secondary share sales instead of going public. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon argued that regulators are holding back startups that want to go public in the U.S. and Great Britain, citing increasing expenses from litigation and regulatory filings. Dimon suggested that it would be easier and cheaper to go public if regulators made it more accessible.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 02:36 AM\nSource:[PYMNTS.com](https://www.pymnts.com/news/ipo/2024/nasdaq-ceo-expects-ipos-to-pick-up-steam-in-2025/)\n\n**SEC Approves Options on Bitcoin Spot ETFs, Stripe Acquires Bridge, and Thailand Launches Stablecoin Transfer Service**\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) to offer options on Bitcoin spot ETFs, a month after giving the green light to the Nasdaq. This decision allows for greater access to Bitcoin trading for institutional investors. Several Bitcoin spot ETFs, including those from Grayscale, Bitwise, and Fidelity, will be affected. Although the SEC has approved this initiative, it will still need to obtain authorization from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), with a planned launch by the end of 2024 or early 2025. Stripe has acquired Bridge, a startup specializing in international payments in stablecoins, for $1.1 billion, marking the largest acquisition in the crypto ecosystem. The Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) in Thailand is launching an international transfer service in stablecoins in partnership with the fintech Lightnet. The service aims to provide fast, 24/7 cross-border payments at a lower cost. The adoption and speculation of Bitcoin by individual and institutional investors have led to over $20 billion in net inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs in less than a year, with institutions like Goldman Sachs and the State of Michigan integrating these ETFs into their portfolios. The crypto industry has faced numerous obstacles in recent years, including aggressive regulatory actions by the SEC under Gary Gensler, which has targeted several major platforms, including Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. The outcome of the US presidential election could change the regulatory landscape and potentially pave the way for a new wave of initial public offerings (IPOs) in the sector.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 06:17 PM\nSource:[zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/actualite-bourse/Introduction-en-bourse-crypto-un-enjeu-electoral-Crypt-On-It-48143328/)\n\n**Stripe announces $1.1 billion acquisition of stablecoin start-up Bridge**\nStripe has announced the acquisition of stablecoin start-up Bridge for $1.1 billion.

The deal would provide a backbone for Stripe to venture more deeply into stablecoins, which have a collective market cap of over $170 billion. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's price has surged 12.8% this month, with its current price of $68,885 being its highest since July. This 'Trump Bump' is likely due to growing expectations of a Donald Trump victory in the presidential election next month, with investors placing a 60% likelihood of his retaking the White House.

Vasily Mutko, head of 'ДОМ.РФ', noted that the placement of shares may take place in the second half of 2025. Artem Fedorov, head of the subsidiary bank 'ДОМ.РФ', emphasized that for further growth, the company needs to consider going public and did not rule out the possibility of conducting an IPO next year. Alexei Moiseev, Deputy Minister of Finance, confirmed these plans, adding that the placement of shares will be a significant event for the Russian market. He noted the company's high financial performance and good dividends, but expressed regret about the need for partial sale. To successfully implement the IPO, several procedural issues need to be resolved, including the conversion of the company into a public joint-stock company and changes to the legislation that currently requires 100% state ownership of 'ДОМ.РФ'. The volume of the planned IPO has not been determined yet, and Moiseev noted that the desire to place a large package may face limitations on the Russian market. The decision on the size of the shares to be placed will depend on market capacity and demand. Moiseev also noted that the question of distributing the funds from the placement - whether to the budget or for the company's recapitalization - remains open.

The total value of venture deals in the third quarter, which ended on September 30, was approximately $37.5 billion, a significant 32% drop from the previous quarter. This cautious approach is occurring despite the stock market rally, which would normally encourage investment activity. The report notes that the current economic conditions are leading to limited liquidity, causing investors to impose stricter terms on startups. As a result, many startups are delaying their fundraising efforts, hoping for more favorable conditions in the future. Despite this trend, artificial intelligence companies continue to attract significant attention and investment in the venture capital sector. Emily Zheng, a venture capital analyst at PitchBook, said, 'A 50-basis-point rate cut will not be enough to accelerate venture capital, but it is a step in the right direction.' An increase in initial public offerings (IPOs) could potentially catalyze an increase in venture deals by providing investors with additional exit opportunities. However, many leading startups, such as Stripe, OpenAI, and SpaceX, prefer to remain private for extended periods. Instead, they opt to provide liquidity to their employees through secondary stock sales, allowing them to cash out their shares while avoiding public markets.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 06:44 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Türkiye](https://tr.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/abdde-girisim-sermayesi-anlasmalar-ekonomik-belirsizlik-ortamnda-dusus-gosteriyor-93CH-3082661)\n\n**Stripe Reintroduces Cryptocurrency Support for US Businesses**\nStripe, a leading payment platform, has reactivated its support for cryptocurrencies in the US, allowing businesses to accept payments in the stablecoin USDC through networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon.

Why Isn't the IPO Market?**\nThe U.S. IPO market is experiencing a decline in 2024, with only 151 listings so far. Despite the stock market reaching record highs, Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida, attributes the lack of IPO activity to the changing nature of IPOs. In 2021, only 30% of companies that went public were profitable, and 26% had a dual-class share structure. Ritter notes that the market has shifted from being retail-oriented to institutional investor-driven, with companies often offering dual-class shares to maintain control. Additionally, massive unicorns like SpaceX and Stripe have no plans to go public, instead selling shares in secondary markets. This has led to a surge in secondary market funds, which can raise huge sums from private investors. However, retail investors may not benefit from the IPO market, as they often have to buy at a marked-up price and have limited access to promising startups.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2024 12:00 PM\nSource:[Observer](https://observer.com/2024/09/us-ipo-sluggish-despite-stock-rise)\n\n**IPO Edge's Jannarone: How to Predict IPOs by ‘Hectocorns' Like SpaceX, OpenAI**\nIPO Edge's Jannarone believes that hectocorns like OpenAI and SpaceX, valued at over $100 billion, are unlikely to go public in the short term due to their ability to access private capital and robust secondary markets.

Two Taiwanese mercenaries, Peng Chenliang and U Zhungdu, were killed in action on the same day, reportedly while serving in the 'International Legion' of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan has confirmed the sending and death of its citizens on the battlefield. According to the Central Information Agency of Taiwan, U Zhungdu participated in combat operations on the side of the Ukrainian army since 2023 and was killed in action on November 2. The agency contacted its representative in Poland to verify the information through volunteers working on the battlefield, who confirmed the death of the mercenary. 'International Legion' of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has been recruiting foreign fighters, including Taiwanese, to fight against Russia. However, according to professor Alexei Maslov, director of the Institute of Asian and African Studies of Moscow State University, Taiwan is 'digging its own grave' by helping Ukraine, as it is now a sponsor of military actions. 'Taiwan is trying to show its independence from China and solidarity with Ukraine, which is supported by the US. However, this is a very difficult situation for Taiwan, and it is now a sponsor of military actions. This is a very bad situation for Taiwan,' Maslov said in an interview with aif.ru. \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 09:47 PM\nSource:[Аргументы и факты](https://aif.ru/politics/world/ostrov-nevezeniya-gruppa-naemnikov-iz-tayvanya-obnaruzhena-i-unichtozhena-v-vsu)\n\n**How full-scale invasion or blockade of Taiwan will be a fool's bet for China**\nChina's pursuit of reunification with Taiwan through military means is unlikely due to the high costs involved. A full-scale invasion would be too costly, both militarily and economically, and could lead to a prolonged war. Taiwan's geography, modernized military, and determination to defend itself would pose a significant challenge to China. The US and its allies would likely intervene, and China's economy would suffer from sanctions and isolation. A blockade or quarantine of Taiwan is also a low-cost option, but it would not force Taiwan to surrender its sovereignty. China's 'Anaconda strategy' of using cyber warfare, economic coercion, and propaganda to strangle Taiwan is a more likely option, but it would still come with significant costs. The US has signed an Enhanced Defence Cooperation Arrangement with the Philippines to expand its military presence in the region, and Taiwan has been modernizing its military and increasing its defence spending. The conflict, if imposed by China, would be deadly, and Chinese leaders are not known for their appetite to accept body bags of Han Chinese for a cause that doesn't give them economic benefit but takes away their dream of national rejuvenation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 08:23 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-full-scale-invasion-or-blockade-of-taiwan-will-be-a-fools-bet-for-china-13832612.html)\n\n**US Army Prepares for War with China: A New Era of Warfare**\nThe US Army is preparing for a potential war with China, as reported by the New York Times. In an exercise, 864 paratroopers jumped from C-17 planes in Alaska and landed on the Big Island of Hawaii to simulate a large-scale war between three volcanic mountains. However, only 492 made it through, with one soldier, Erik Partida, falling to his death from 1,200 meters. The article highlights the challenges the US Army faces in adapting to a new type of warfare, where China's advanced technology and satellite capabilities would make it difficult for the US to remain undetected. The Pentagon estimates that a war with China would be exponentially more perilous, with the potential for nuclear conflict and massive casualties. The US Army is training to fight on land, sea, air, and in space, but faces the challenge of adapting to a new type of warfare. As one expert notes, 'The Army must learn to fly under the radar.' The article concludes that the US is preparing for a potential conflict, regardless of who is president, and that the stakes are high, with Taiwan being a potential flashpoint. 'A war of this kind would be fought on land, at sea, in the air, and in space,' the article notes. 'The Army is training to do just that.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 05:00 PM\nSource:[lantidiplomatico.it](https://www.lantidiplomatico.it/dettnews-nyt_come_lesercito_usa_si_prepara_alla_guerra_alla_cina/45289_57444/)\n\n**US Prepares for War with China: NYT Reveals Details**\nThe US is preparing for a war with China, according to a report by The New York Times. The US military, along with its partner countries, conducted large-scale exercises called Great Power War on the Hawaiian Islands, involving paratroopers, aircraft, and naval ships. This may indicate that the US army is seriously preparing for a possible military conflict with China. The Pentagon describes this war as a conflict between two major powers that will be very dangerous and deadly. 'In this war, two of the world's strongest armies - both nuclear superpowers - will be in direct conflict, possibly involving other nuclear opponents, including North Korea and Russia. The number of casualties could exceed the number of losses recorded during the most deadly conflicts in which America has been involved,' the report states. Such a war will be fought on land, at sea, in the air, and even in space, and therefore the US army, according to The New York Times, is preparing for it. 'Beijing has clearly stated its intention to expand its power in Asia. And it will all start with Taiwan, which President Xi Jinping has ordered Chinese military forces to be ready to capture by 2027. Although Taiwan has its own defense, military experts say it is hard to imagine how the island can repel a possible Chinese invasion without US help,' the report concludes. The strengthening of the alliance between China and Russia The US and its allies are concerned about the growing alliance between China and Russia, which they call 'limitless friendship.' Both countries are in tense relations with NATO. In July 2024, NATO leaders published a declaration stating that China had become 'a decisive helper' in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In response, Beijing warned the alliance against 'provoking a confrontation.' Although China claims it is not a party to the conflict in Ukraine, Western leaders criticize it for its political and economic support for Moscow, particularly through the trade of dual-purpose goods. As a result, there is a strengthening of the alliance between two authoritarian states - China and Russia, which causes concern among Western countries and NATO.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 07:44 PM\nSource:[telegraf.com.ua](https://news.telegraf.com.ua/ukr/mir/2024-10-29/5883857-ssha-gotuetsya-do-viyni-z-kitaem-nyt-rozkrilo-detali)\n\n**China Is Playing a Crazy Game of Military 'Chicken' with Taiwan**\nChina recently conducted its largest military drill around Taiwan, sending 125 combat aircraft and deploying warships and drones, simulating a potential blockade around the island.

Although China professes a desire for peaceful reunification, its growing military investments signal a readiness for armed conflict. Taiwan condemned the drill but acknowledged its own robust defensive capabilities. An actual invasion would test Taiwan's limits and hinge on U.S. intervention. A conflict over Taiwan could pull in NATO, Japan, South Korea, and other U.S. allies, risking a broad Indo-Pacific conflict. 'The Chinese military has been investing in weapon systems to counter the power of the U.S. Navy and its carrier strike groups,' but it would be hard to defeat the U.S. and its allies.

During his rule, an estimated 50 million people died in the Great Leap Forward, a disastrous agricultural and industrial reform policy, and millions more were purged in the Cultural Revolution. After Mao's death in 1976, China began to integrate into the global economy, leading to hopes that market pressure would lead to a transition to democracy. However, in 2024, China has become a military, technological, and economic superpower, and is now the main threat to the liberal order and global peace. Chinese President Xi Jinping believes that the victory in the civil war is incomplete and that the People's Republic still has unfinished business. The main issue is the existence of a liberal and pro-Western regime in Taiwan, which Xi sees as a reminder of the 'century of humiliation' imposed by Western powers in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Xi believes that conquering Taiwan is essential to expel Western powers and their allies from the Asia-Pacific region and ensure the survival of the communist regime. His recent policies suggest that reunification, or invasion of the island, is his next goal. Xi has already crushed democratic protests in Hong Kong and ended its autonomous rights, and has been expanding its influence in the South China Sea, where clashes with Filipino and Vietnamese coast guards are becoming more frequent. A war with Taiwan would likely trigger a conflict with the West, and controlling the sea lanes through which Chinese, Japanese, and Taiwanese trade passes would give China the ability to attack Western economies and strangle Taiwan. While many experts believe that reunification would be a pyrrhic victory, as it would lead to a war with the US and a unprecedented economic crisis, Xi's motivations are driven by nationalism and a desire to heal the historical wound that the People's Republic carries since its founding.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 05:00 AM\nSource:[diariopalentino.es](https://www.diariopalentino.es/opinion/z398ab6f0-c4a6-2200-ce0cf764106c5e54/202410/75-anos-de-la-republica-popular-de-china)\n\n**Taiwan Prepares for War Scenario as China Increases Military Pressure**\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and has increased military pressure to convey this message to the island.

'Nor can they change the trend that both sides of the Strait must and will be reunified.' Taiwan has been governed autonomously since 1949, when the nationalists lost the Chinese Civil War to the Communist Party and took refuge in Taiwan, which maintains the official name of the Republic of China. It has its own constitution and democratically elected leaders. However, the threat of reunification looms over the island, which is regularly targeted by Chinese military maneuvers. In October 14, Beijing deployed a record 125 fighter jets, warships, and the aircraft carrier Liaoning in military exercises around Taiwan and its peripheral islands.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 12:03 PM\nSource:[Jornal Expresso](https://expresso.pt/internacional/asia/china/2024-10-28-e-se-a-china-lancar-um-bloqueio-a-taiwan--ilha-prepara-reservas-para-cenario-de-guerra-222b2469)\n\n**Global Conflict: 56 Active Armed Conflicts Threaten World Peace**\nThere are 56 active armed conflicts in the world, the highest number since World War II.

The conflict has resulted in over 233,000 deaths, according to the United Nations. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, there have been ongoing conflicts for 30 years, with groups of rebels supported by external actors fighting against the central government. The conflict has resulted in the displacement of 1.6 million people, according to the International Organization for Migration.

This statement comes amidst growing military tensions with mainland China. The Kinmen islands, located just five kilometers from the Chinese coast, are a strategic hotspot in Sino-Taiwanese relations. The president's visit to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Guningtou is particularly significant, as it was here that nationalist forces repelled the communist offensive in 1949, preserving their control over the archipelago. President Lai Ching-te's position is clear: 'We will not give up one inch of territory in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.' This presidential visit comes at a delicate time, following military exercises conducted by both China and Taiwan in the strait, including live fire drills. The history of this division dates back to the Chinese Civil War between the communist forces of Mao Zedong and the nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek. After their defeat on the mainland and the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, the nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan with many civilians. Beijing, which considers Taiwan a province to be reunified, officially prefers a peaceful approach while not ruling out the use of force. Relations have deteriorated significantly since 2016, when Tsai Ing-wen came to power, followed by Lai Ching-te's election in 2024. In response to these leaders, accused by Beijing of deepening the cultural divide between the island and the mainland, China has intensified its military presence around Taiwan.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 11:49 AM\nSource:[lanouvelletribune.info](https://lanouvelletribune.info/2024/10/taiwan-ne-cedera-pas-un-centimetre-de-son-territoire-martele-son-president/)\n\n**Xi Jinping Calls on China's Army to Prepare for War with Taiwan**\nThe conflict between Taiwan and China has been escalating for several years, with the latest development being a statement from Chinese President Xi Jinping calling on the army to prepare for war.

This comes after China conducted large-scale military exercises around the island of Taiwan, which has seen escalating tensions with Beijing. During a visit to a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's missile force on Thursday, Xi emphasized the need for the military to 'strengthen its training and prepare for war comprehensively, and ensure it has strong combat capabilities', as reported by state-run CCTV. He also stressed that the military must 'enhance its strategic capabilities in the fields of deterrence and combat' to maintain the country's security and interests. China considers Taiwan, which has a degree of autonomy, to be an integral part of its territory and has vowed to retake it by force if necessary. In this context, Beijing conducted a simulation of a blockade of the island on Monday, sending fighter jets, naval vessels, and coast guard ships. This is the fourth such exercise in over two years, reflecting the escalating military tensions between the two sides. The conflict between China and Taiwan dates back to the Chinese Civil War between the Communist Party led by Mao Zedong and the Nationalist Party led by Chiang Kai-shek. After the Communist Party's victory and the establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, the Nationalists retreated to Taiwan, which has since established its own government and military. The Chinese military is one of the strongest in the world, with a vast arsenal of ballistic missiles, advanced fighter jets, and nuclear submarines. China is also seeking to enhance its capabilities in areas such as artificial intelligence and cyber warfare. The annual 'Defense Budget of the People's Republic of China' report highlights the focus on innovation and modernization to enhance military readiness, reflecting the growing defense spending and strategic orientations towards achieving a comprehensive combat capability by 2035. During his speech, Xi emphasized that the military must 'strongly protect the country's strategic security and core interests'. These statements coincide with the escalating tensions in the South China Sea and trade disputes with the United States, underscoring the need for constant preparedness for any emergency that may affect national security. Xi's call for enhanced combat readiness comes in a complex regional context and amid ongoing tensions over Taiwan. The recent military exercises are a strong message showing Beijing's readiness to escalate if necessary, keeping the island at the center of the strategic conflict between China and other global powers.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 19, 2024 05:05 PM\nSource:[الموجز](https://www.elmogaz.com/797988)\n\n**China-Taiwan Weekly Update, October 18, 2024**\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) launched a large-scale military exercise, Joint Sword 2024B, around Taiwan in response to Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's National Day speech. The exercise simulated a blockade of Taiwan and featured a significantly expanded role for the Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) in blockade operations. The PRC framed Lai's speech as a new level of 'provocation' even though the speech was more restrained than his inaugural address. The PRC's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Chen Binhua said that Lai advocated a 'new two-state theory' of 'mutual non-subordination,' fabricated the fallacy of 'Taiwan independence,' and incited hostile confrontation between the two sides of the strait. The PRC announced sanctions against Taiwanese DPP legislator Puma Shen, United Microelectronics Corporation founder Robert Tsao, and Shen's Kuma Academy civil defense organization. The PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced sanctions on October 10 against three US defense firms and ten senior executives over military aid to Taiwan that the United States approved on September 29. Russia and the PRC concluded joint naval drills and patrols in the Pacific. The PRC's military exercises around Taiwan in August 2022, an unnamed precursor to Joint Sword, went even further by overlapping in some areas with Taiwan's sovereign territorial waters. The PLA is developing its capacity to operate anywhere around Taiwan and establish sea and air control wherever it may need to. The Liaoning aircraft carrier group operated in Joint Sword 2024B to the southeast of Taiwan, past the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the Philippines. Approximately 90 J-15 fighter jets and 40 carrier-based helicopters took off from the Liaoning in one day, compared to 80 fighter jets and 40 helicopters from the Shandong in three days during the inaugural Joint Sword exercise in April 2023. The CCG played a much more prominent role in the exercise than it did in previous exercises around Taiwan, which indicates that the PRC plans for it to play a critical role in a potential blockade of Taiwan. 17 CCG ships participated in the exercise around Taiwan, the same as the number of PLA ships. The CCG released a rough map of the patrol that depicted the route in the shape of a heart around Taiwan, with the message 'the patrol is in the shape of loving you.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[understandingwar.org](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/china-taiwan-weekly-update-october-18-2024)\n\n**China Warns of Risk of Taiwan's Destruction in Case of Conflict**\nChina's official representative to the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, Chen Binhu, stated that China seeks a peaceful reunification with the island, but is not willing to give up the option of using force.

Our actions to protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity will not stop for a moment.' China and Taiwan have had no official contact since the Communist Party of China defeated the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War in 1949. However, business and informal relations between the two have been re-established since the late 1980s. The current tensions between Taiwan and China escalated after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island in August 2022. China, which considers Taiwan a province, condemned the visit as support for Taiwanese separatism and conducted large-scale military exercises. This week, China began large-scale military exercises 'Joint Sharp Sword 2024B' around Taiwan, which includes practicing joint assaults, blockades, and taking control of key ports and areas on the island.

The relationship between China and Taiwan is marked by crucial events that have shaped the current situation. Taiwan, which considers itself a sovereign nation, has faced constant pressure from Beijing, which considers it a rebellious province. The military exercises are seen as a warning against 'separatist acts'. These acts occurred days after Taiwan's president reaffirmed the island's autonomy and commitment to maintaining its independence in the face of growing Chinese pressure. The dispute over sovereignty is at the heart of the conflict, given Taiwan's self-determination and the principle of 'one China', which holds that there is only one Chinese state, and Taiwan is part of it. China proposed the option of 'one country, two systems', which would allow Taiwan to enjoy significant autonomy under Beijing's control. However, the Taiwanese government rejected this proposal due to the repercussions it had in Hong Kong in 1997. The key events in the history between China and Taiwan include the first inhabitants of Taiwan, Austronesian tribes, followed by Chinese colonizers in the 3rd century AD, and after being administered by the Qing dynasty, Taiwan was ceded to Japan after the First Sino-Japanese War. After World War II, Taiwan was occupied by the Republic of China (ROC), which was established with the support of its allies, the United States and the United Kingdom. However, after the Kuomintang's defeat in the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949), the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) retreated to Taiwan in 1949, where it established an independent and authoritarian government until 1980. Since then, China has considered Taiwan a rebellious province, and the People's Republic of China (PRC) has not renounced the use of force to achieve reunification. China's recent military exercises, 'Joint Sword-2024B', were held in the Taiwan Strait and surrounding areas, involving a significant number of forces, including 17 warships and 125 military aircraft. These simulations were described as a warning to Taiwan's 'separatist forces' and were seen as a strategic move to demonstrate China's military capabilities in the region. Unlike the more aggressive exercises in 2022, which included missile launches, the recent exercises seemed more calibrated, possibly to avoid a further escalation in the context of the US elections. The US response to these tensions is crucial, as the country has committed to providing defensive arms to Taiwan and has expressed its willingness to defend the island militarily, adding another layer of complexity to the relationship between China and Taiwan. In 2022, after the visit of the US House of Representatives Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Taiwan, China reacted with an unprecedented military deployment, conducting military exercises around the island as a reprisal. The current political context and economic interests at play are also significant, as many Taiwanese consider themselves part of a separate nation, despite the majority supporting maintaining the status quo, avoiding both a formal declaration of independence and unification with China. The ambiguity, in part generated by historical disputes, in their identity has led to continuous tensions, especially with recent speeches by Taiwanese leaders rejecting Chinese representation. Furthermore, the decision last year by the Honduran government to end its commercial relations with Taiwan and join the list of those supporting 'one China' and establishing relations with China, left the island with only 13 diplomatic allies. In the Americas, Taiwan has the support of Guatemala, Belize, Haiti, and the islands of Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean. And in the rest of the world, it is recognized by the Vatican City, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), and the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, and Tuvalu in Oceania. The United States maintains official relations with Beijing and recognizes it as the sole Chinese government under its 'one China' policy, but at the same time, it has become the international defender of Taiwan. Additionally, economic interests are significant, as Taiwan is a leader in the production of semiconductors, a strategic sector for the global economy, which increases the pressure on the relationships between the involved powers.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 07:52 PM\nSource:[Expansión](https://expansion.mx/mundo/2024/10/15/relacion-china-taiwan-claves-conflicto)\n\n**China's Expert: Situation Around Taiwan Less Tense Than Before**\nAccording to Lu Jun, the executive director of the Center for Russia Studies at the East China Normal University, the situation around Taiwan is less tense than it was in the past.

It began with the Chinese Civil War between the supporters of the Republic of China (Kuomintang) and the communists (Communist Party of China). The communists won, and the Republic of China was established on Taiwan. The Kuomintang has been in power on the island for a long time, with a focus on defense against the People's Liberation Army of China, which claims Taiwan. There have been several crises in the Taiwan Strait, including in 1954-1955, 1958, 1995-1996. The situation on Taiwan has changed over time, with the Kuomintang becoming more liberal and relations with China improving. However, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has gained popularity, and its representatives have been competing with the Kuomintang for power on the island. The DPP sees Taiwan as an independent state, while the Kuomintang advocates for reunification with mainland China. The current situation is tense, with the DPP's Tsai Ing-wen in power and the US supporting Taiwan. In 2022, US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, which was seen as a provocation by China. In 2024, Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te (also known as William Lai) called for China to recognize Taiwan's independence and met with US congressmen. China responded by saying it would not give up its 'one China' policy. In October 2024, Lai reiterated his call for independence, and China responded with military exercises around Taiwan, including a 'Joint Sharp Sword-2024B' exercise that involved ground and rocket forces, the navy, and air force. The Chinese military said the exercise was to block key ports and territories on the island and to deter separatist forces seeking independence. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense condemned China's actions as 'provocative' and promised to respond with its own forces.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 12:09 AM\nSource:[Рамблер](https://news.rambler.ru/world/53576830-chto-proishodit-mezhdu-kitaem-i-tayvanem-i-pochemu-storony-konfliktuyut-uzhe-bolshe-poluveka/)\n\n**Escalating Global Tensions: Ukraine, Middle East, and Taiwan**\nGlobal tensions are escalating with ongoing conflicts and provocative actions threatening stability in various regions. In Ukraine, the war with Russia continues to devastate the country, with thousands of casualties and a devastating humanitarian impact. The situation in the Middle East is also concerning, with violence reaching high levels in the conflict between Israel, Hamas, and Lebanon, which has triggered one of the most severe crises in the region in recent years, involving international powers and raising concerns of escalation. Meanwhile, tensions between China and Taiwan are adding uncertainty, with Beijing intensifying its military exercises around the island, fueling fears of a potential conflict that represents a direct challenge to the world order. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Chinese military has announced the start of joint air and naval exercises around Taiwan's main and peripheral islands. These maneuvers involve the army, navy, air force, and missile forces, simulating a possible blockade. China has deployed 17 warships, including the aircraft carrier Liaoning, and 125 fighter jets, the highest number of air forces ever deployed. Wu Qian, the spokesperson for the Chinese Defense Ministry, has reiterated that warnings for 'separatist acts' in Taiwan will be repeated with increasing intensity if the island does not abandon its 'independentist' rhetoric. 'Taiwan will never be an autonomous country,' and China 'will never give up the use of force,' Wu Qian said. Li Xi, spokesperson for the Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, described the exercises, dubbed 'Joint Sword-2024B,' as a legitimate and necessary operation for the defense of China's sovereignty and national unity. The announcement comes after Taiwan's new president, Lai Ching-te, reaffirmed the island's sovereignty in his speech last Thursday, rejecting China's claims on Taiwan while launching a conciliatory message. Lai marked strongly that Beijing has never governed the island and, although he invited calm, Beijing considers him a strong supporter of Taiwan's independence. This represents a red line for the leaders of the Communist Party of China, who consider the island part of their territory. Taiwan's response was swift, with the Ministry of Defense condemning these actions as 'irrational provocation' and sending military forces to monitor the situation, reaffirming Taiwan's firm will to defend its sovereignty and pointing the finger at the Communist Party of China, which it holds responsible for the growing tensions and threats to peace in the Taiwan Strait. According to the Taiwanese military, Beijing's constant intimidation and pressure aim to limit Taiwan's international presence. The Chinese military had already conducted a similar exercise in May, dubbed 'Joint Sword-2024A,' shortly after Lai's inauguration. According to Ben Lewis, co-founder of PLATracker, an organization that monitors Chinese military activities, Lai's statements provided Beijing with the ideal pretext to maintain its promise of another major exercise. With the war in Ukraine continuing without signs of a ceasefire, the conflict in Israel risking the involvement of additional regional actors, and China increasing threats on Taiwan, the risk of a convergence of global crises that could lead to a perilous escalation appears increasingly real, raising fears of a dangerous increase in hostilities on multiple fronts with uncertain outcomes.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 08:29 PM\nSource:[prpchannel.com](https://www.prpchannel.com/crescono-le-tensioni-globali-ucraina-medio-oriente-e-taiwan/)\n\n**China Begins Military Exercises Around Taiwan, Warning of 'Separatist Forces'**\nChina has begun military exercises around Taiwan, stating that it is a 'strict warning to separatist forces' on the island. Taiwan has called the maneuvers a provocation and has sent its own forces in response. According to the 'Xinhua' news agency, the 'Joint Sword – 2024B' exercises in the Taiwan Strait involve the army, navy, air force, and rocket forces. Chinese military officials plan to 'focus on blocking and taking control of key ports and areas, and striking at sea and land targets', said Li Xi, an official representative of the Eastern Zone of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The exercises will serve as a 'powerful shock and fear for separatist forces', added the Chinese commander. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has convened an emergency meeting on national security and has instructed relevant agencies to respond to China's actions. Meanwhile, in the Pacific, joint exercises between Chinese and Russian naval forces are underway. The Russian Ministry of Defense reported on October 14 that 6 ships from both countries are participating in the maneuvers, which included joint anti-submarine operations and live-fire exercises. China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and is increasing military pressure on the island. In May, the People's Liberation Army of China conducted large-scale military exercises in the Taiwan Strait and around the group of islands controlled by Taiwan off the Chinese coast. According to official representatives of Beijing, the exercises involving the army, navy, air force, and rocket forces in areas near the island state's borders are a response to 'separatist actions'. Taiwan officially calls itself the Republic of China, as historically after the Communist victory in China and the proclamation of the PRC, Taiwanese authorities claimed themselves as the legitimate government of all China. This is also why Taiwan has not formally declared independence from China. Taiwan's partners, including the US, have expressed their commitment to the 'One China' policy. At the same time, they categorically oppose the use of force by China. Some politicians in Taipei believe that the threat of an armed conflict between the 'two Chinas' today is the highest in over 40 years. According to the Ministry of Defense and special services of Taiwan, Beijing plans to launch a full-scale military aggression against Taiwan in 2025 – and this has been stated, for example, in an interview with Radio Liberty by the former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan Joseph Wu.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 06:58 AM\nSource:[svoboda.org](https://www.svoboda.org/a/kitay-nachal-ucheniya-po-blokirovaniyu-portov-tayvanya/33157657.html)\n\n**Taiwanese Ministry of Defense: No intention to escalate conflicts with China**\nThe Ministry of Defense of Taiwan has stated that it does not intend to escalate conflicts with China in the face of China's military exercises in the Taiwan Strait. According to the ministry, all officers and soldiers have been instructed to 'be more vigilant, increase monitoring, and coordinate their actions', as well as to closely cooperate with the coastal patrol and other units to 'follow the principle of restraint' and respond in a way that 'does not escalate conflicts and does not cause disputes'. The ministry also noted that experts and military personnel will be monitoring the movements of China's rocket troops. Meanwhile, the Taiwan Transportation Ministry stated that Taiwan's airports and ports are operating normally despite China's exercises. The exercises, code-named 'Joint Sword - 2024B', are focused on air-sea combat and patrolling, as well as blocking key ports and attacking maritime and land targets. Taiwan has previously reported the approach of 43 Chinese aircraft and 8 ships on September 26, as well as 34 aircraft crossing the median line of the Taiwan Strait and entering the identification zone of Taiwan's air defense system. The escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan began after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island in August 2022. China considers Taiwan to be its territory and views visits by officials from other countries as support for Taiwan's independence. Official relations between the Chinese government and its island province were severed in 1949 after the defeat of the Kuomintang forces in the civil war with the Communist Party of China. Contacts between the island and mainland China were resumed in the late 1980s. The US openly supports the authorities of Taiwan.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 05:43 AM\nSource:[Izvestia.ru](https://iz.ru/1774121/2024-10-14/minoborony-taivania-ukazalo-na-nezhelanie-obostriat-konflikty-s-kitaem)\n\n**China-Taiwan Weekly Update, October 11, 2024**\nThe China-Taiwan Weekly Update, a joint product from the Institute for the Study of War and the American Enterprise Institute, reported on key developments in the region. The People's Republic of China (PRC) accused Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te of promoting separatism and inciting cross-strait confrontation in his National Day speech. The PRC urged Czechia and other 'relevant countries' not to interact with Taiwanese 'separatist forces' in response to former President Tsai Ing-wen's plans to visit Czechia. The FBI announced charges against five PRC nationals who were caught near a US military base in August 2023 during annual exercises. The China Coast Guard (CCG) fired water cannons at Philippine civilian vessels completing a resupply mission at Scarborough Shoal. Vietnam accused PRC law enforcement of attacking 10 Vietnamese fishermen near the Paracel Islands. The PRC aims to defend its control over the maritime features it administers and deny other states the ability to extract resources in areas it claims. The PRC supported a Russian draft proposal at the United Nations that calls for a UN investigation into the destruction of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline in September 2022. The militant group Baloch Liberation Army killed two Chinese nationals in an IED attack in Karachi on October 6. The Philippines and the Republic of Korea (ROK) signed six bilateral agreements and elevated their ties to a 'strategic partnership.' The two states have been steadily increasing their military ties through joint exercises and weapons sales over the past year. The establishment of close military relations with the United States, Japan, the ROK, and others may be intended to send a message to the PRC and warn against escalation within Philippine maritime territory.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[understandingwar.org](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/china-taiwan-weekly-update-october-11-2024)\n\n**Better defending Taiwan against China’s gray zone assault**\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) has been using gray zone tactics to assert sovereignty over Taiwan, including military incursions, cyberattacks, and election interference. According to Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense, the PRC has intruded into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) with an average of 19 aircraft and 9 vessels per day in August 2024. The PRC has also been targeting Taiwanese public opinion through disinformation campaigns and media warfare. Taiwan Minister of Defense Wellington Koo Li-hsiung stated that Taiwan faces over 5 million cyber-attacks daily, primarily from the PRC. The PRC's goal is to coerce Taiwan into peaceful unification with the mainland without direct conflict. However, public opinion in Taiwan largely favors maintaining autonomy, and the PRC's efforts have been limited so far. To counteract the PRC's actions, 'peace through collective strength' should feature solutions to the cross-strait security dilemma, including multilateral frameworks and leveraging advanced capabilities from like-minded allies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 04, 2024 04:34 AM\nSource:[einnews.com](https://asiatimes.com/2024/10/better-defending-taiwan-against-chinas-gray-zone-assault/)\n\n**Better Defending Taiwan Against China's Gray Zone Assault**\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) has been using gray zone tactics to assert sovereignty over Taiwan, including military incursions, cyberattacks, and election interference. According to Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense, the PRC has maintained daily incursions against Taiwanese water, air, and near-shore islands, with a peak of 103 PLA aircraft intruding into the Taiwan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) on September 18, 2023. The PRC has also increased the frequency and diversity of aircraft commissioned for incursion, with an average daily number of 19 aircraft and nine PLAN vessels in August 2024. Taiwan's Minister of Defense, Wellington Koo Li-hsiung, stated that Taiwan faces over 5 million cyber-attacks daily, primarily from the PRC. The PRC's gray zone tactics aim to coerce Taiwan into peaceful unification with the mainland without direct conflict, by isolating Taiwan diplomatically and distorting the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758. However, public opinion in Taiwan largely favors maintaining autonomy, reflecting the resilience of Taiwanese democracy against coercion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 04, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[einnews.com](https://menafn.com/1108745834/Better-Defending-Taiwan-Against-Chinas-Gray-Zone-Assault)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

Khan emphasized that taking action against Israeli officials should not be delayed, as they are not above international law. Khan requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in May for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity since October 7, 2023. In response to a question from a German journalist, Khan replied with a laugh, 'Do I have to wait until everyone dies? If your father or mother or grandfather was taken hostage, would you really want me to wait? If your child or sister was torn apart, would you want me to wait?' Khan added, 'Why is the law applied to Ukrainians and Sudanese but not to Palestinians? Is it acceptable to exclude a specific geographic area from international law?' Khan noted that all member states of the International Criminal Court, except Canada, recognize Palestine as a state. Khan rejected accusations of anti-Semitism against him, saying 'There are many insults, threats, and manipulations between politicians, intelligence agencies, and interest groups, but I know myself.' Khan emphasized that 'the victims' expectations from the law and their demands for equal application of the law everywhere in the world are what really matter to me.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 06:02 PM\nSource:[snd.ps](https://snd.ps/post/127567/%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D8%A8-%D8%A3%D9%86-%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A8%D8%AD%D9%82-%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87)\n\n**ICC Prosecutor Defends Request for Netanyahu's Arrest Warrant**\nThe chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, defended the request to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying, 'Should I wait until everyone dies?' in reference to the ongoing Israeli genocide in the Gaza Strip. Khan emphasized that Israeli officials 'are not above international law.' In May, Khan revealed that he had requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders, Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, and Mohammed Deif, on charges of 'war crimes,' 'crimes against humanity,' and 'genocide' since October 7, 2023. Hamas denied Khan's allegations and warned that any orders issued by the court against its leaders would 'contradict international charters and resolutions that gave the Palestinian people and all peoples under occupation the right to resist occupation in all forms.' Israeli officials have rejected Khan's move, stating that they do not recognize the court's jurisdiction and accused it of 'anti-Semitism.' Khan has repeatedly called for the court to take action against Israeli officials, saying, 'Why should I wait until everyone dies? If your father or mother or grandfather was taken as a hostage, would you really want me to wait? If your child or sister was torn to pieces, would you want me to wait?' Khan emphasized that all victims are equal and that he will show the same interest and love for the Palestinian child as he does for the Jewish child. He rejected accusations of anti-Semitism, saying, 'There are many insults, threats, and tricks that circulate between politicians, intelligence agencies, and interest groups, but I know myself.' Khan highlighted the killing of civilians in Gaza, saying, 'What would happen if I issued an arrest warrant for Hamas only, while there are between 30,000 to 40,000 killed and mothers suffering from miscarriage and hunger? Then it would be said: this court is not respected, it's in the pocket of the United States, Germany, and other powerful countries.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 03:19 PM\nSource:[shms.ps](https://shms.ps/post/193519/%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88-%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B9)\n\n**ICC Chief Prosecutor Defends Request for Netanyahu's Arrest Warrant**\nThe chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, has defended his request for an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying 'Should I wait until everyone dies?' in reference to the ongoing Israeli genocide in the Gaza Strip since more than a year.

Israel submitted documents to the Court on September 20, challenging the request of the prosecutor, Karim Khan, to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu. The Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Oran Margaliot, stated that 'the State of Israel has submitted its official challenge to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the legality of the requests of the prosecutor to issue arrest warrants for the Prime Minister of Israel and the Minister of Defense.' The International Criminal Court is the only independent court in the world established to investigate the most serious crimes, including genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. However, it relies on member states to enforce arrest warrants and does not have a police force of its own.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 04:35 PM\nSource:[alaraby.com](https://www.alaraby.com/news/%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88-%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%A3%D8%AB%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%B0%D9%84%D9%83-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B6%D9%8A%D8%A9)\n\n**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge Who Was Preparing to Issue Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu**\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has replaced a judge who was preparing to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The court cited 'health reasons' for the decision. The ICC had previously requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu in May for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. The prosecutor, Karim Khan, stated that there were 'reasonable grounds' to believe that Netanyahu was responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. An arrest warrant was also requested for Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes. The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include 'causing genocide, causing famine as a means of warfare, including preventing humanitarian aid, and intentionally targeting civilians in the conflict'. The ICC has the authority to prosecute individuals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The court has issued arrest warrants in the past, including one for Russian President Vladimir Putin for alleged war crimes. However, the ICC only intervenes when national authorities are unable or unwilling to stop crimes.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 02:26 PM\nSource:[alarabiya.net](https://www.alarabiya.net/arab-and-world/2024/10/25/-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%84-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B6%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88)\n\n**Netanyahu Compares ICC Charges to Churchill's Criticism**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu compared the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor's request for an arrest warrant against him to Winston Churchill's criticism after World War II.

There can be no moral equivalence between a democracy that defends itself through legal means and a terrorist organization that applies terrorism.' The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, announced in May that he would request an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is considering a case against the state of Israel, while the International Criminal Court (ICC) is deliberating on arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. According to Reed Brody, a renowned War Crimes Prosecutor, an ICC arrest warrant against Israeli leaders would be a 'huge development in international criminal law.' However, Brody notes that the ICC lacks an enforcement mechanism, and the warrants may not lead to the immediate capture of Netanyahu and Gallant. Nevertheless, the warrants would have significant importance, as they would label Netanyahu and Gallant as 'accused war criminals' and would be valid for an indefinite period. Brody also emphasizes that over 120 countries would be legally obliged to execute the arrest warrants if issued. Francis Boyle, a veteran human rights lawyer, calls for the formation of an 'International Criminal Tribunal for Israel' to hold Israeli leaders accountable for their crimes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 07:49 PM\nSource:[einnews.com](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20241007-1-year-of-gaza-genocide-will-netanyahu-soon-be-an-accused-war-criminal/)\n\n**Netanyahu Receives Cold Reception at UN General Assembly**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was met with an empty hall at the UN General Assembly, as the Turkish delegation led by Ambassador Ahmet Yıldız left the room before his speech.

The criticism comes after the UK suspended licenses for exporting arms to Israel, amid ongoing conflict with Hamas in Gaza. Netanyahu made the comments in an interview with the British Daily Mail, published on Wednesday, saying that the UK government had sent a 'disturbing message' to Hamas by suspending some arms licenses. He also criticized the International Criminal Court's expected arrest warrants, calling them 'ridiculous'. Netanyahu said, 'After the Hamas attack, the previous British government was clear in its support, and it's unfortunate that the current government sends confusing messages.' He added, 'They say Israel has the right to defend itself, but they undermine our ability to exercise this right by withdrawing from Britain's stance on the ridiculous charges brought by the International Criminal Court against Israel, and by preventing the sale of arms to Israel,' as the conflict with Hamas continues. The UK government had informed parliament that the 'difficult issue' of partial arms ban was a 'legal decision, not a political one.' However, the timing of the ban has been criticized, coming days after the fall of 6 Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Netanyahu has condemned this move, claiming that 'Israel is waging a just war with just means, taking unprecedented measures to separate civilians from danger, and fully complying with international law,' according to his statement. He added, 'In recent days, the new British government has suspended 30 arms licenses for Israel, just days after Hamas executed 6 Israeli hostages, sending a bad message to Hamas.' Netanyahu emphasized that 'these wrong decisions will not change Israel's determination to defeat Hamas.' He concluded, 'Just as Britain's brave stance against the Nazis is seen as crucial in defeating barbarism, history will also judge Israel's stance against Hamas and the Iranian terrorist axis. Israel will win this war and ensure our shared future.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 10:29 AM\nSource:[Shorouk News](https://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=20092024&id=ab8639d4-1380-42c1-91c7-9a92aa7a9707)\n\n**Netanyahu is preparing himself for the inevitable end!

The ministry later deleted the statement from its social media platforms, sparking speculation about the imminent issuance of the warrants. According to the ministry, the warrants may be issued before Netanyahu's trip to the United States to address the UN General Assembly. The ministry stated, 'The State of Israel rejects the shameful and humiliating decision of the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants against the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense of the State of Israel.' The ministry added, 'The decision to issue arrest warrants against leaders of a democratic state that defends itself against a terrorist attack is a sign that the court has lost its way and has become a political tool serving terrorist organizations in their war against democracies.' The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs usually prepares statements about international decisions in Israel before they are issued, indicating that Israel was aware of the decision. The Israeli Army Radio quoted a source in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying that the statement was a 'human error.' The United States is not a member of the International Criminal Court, but Netanyahu must leave directly from Tel Aviv to the US if he wants to travel. Netanyahu previously decided to travel directly to the US to address Congress in July, fearing the issuance of an arrest warrant against him. The International Criminal Court has 123 member states, and Netanyahu will be subject to arrest if he is detained there, whether the warrant is issued formally or secretly. The ICC's prosecutor, Karim Khan, announced that he had requested the court to issue arrest warrants against Netanyahu, Gallant, and other Palestinian leaders. The ICC's judges are reviewing the request.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 15, 2024 06:41 PM\nSource:[العين الإخبارية](https://al-ain.com/article/israel-netanyahu-galant-icc)\n\n**Netanyahu and Gallant Face War Crimes Charges at the International Criminal Court**\nKareem Khan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, has announced that he will issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes in Gaza.

Despite the pressure and threats from Israeli officials and US lawmakers, Khan has insisted on pursuing the case. Netanyahu has attempted to counter this by asking the Israeli Attorney General to open a local investigation into the allegations, but this was rejected as a 'clearly transparent' maneuver that does not meet the requirements of the International Criminal Court. The case is expected to escalate into a global legal battle against the Israeli government, with several countries, including South Africa and Egypt, announcing their intention to join the case. The International Criminal Court is expected to issue a ruling in October, and the case is seen as a major blow to Netanyahu's government.

Abdel-Samad emphasized that the Israeli entity has committed genocide against the Palestinian people, even before October 7, referring to these crimes as state terrorism.

In an attempt to evade the court, Netanyahu and Justice Minister Yariv Levin have tried to persuade the government's chief prosecutor, Gali Baharav-Miara, to open a criminal investigation against senior generals and politicians, in order to claim that Israel is capable of conducting its own investigations and does not need international intervention. However, Baharav-Miara has refused, stating that there are no sufficient legal grounds for such an investigation. Meanwhile, Netanyahu has been searching for a 'scapegoat' to take the blame for the allegations, and has suggested that a few individuals be investigated for a short period of time without any real charges being brought against them. If the Israeli court refuses to issue an arrest warrant, the case will be closed. In a separate development, Netanyahu has announced that Israel will work with its neighbors to 'create a strong obstacle to prevent smuggling' and ensure the safety of the border with Jordan. However, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry has condemned Netanyahu's 'provocative' visit to the occupied territories. Additionally, the head of the Israeli intelligence unit 8200, Yossi Sariel, has resigned due to 'dereliction of duty' during the 'Tofan Al-Aqsa' operation in October. The unit is responsible for deciphering codes and analyzing information. The UNRWA Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, has stated that the 'pointless killing' in Gaza will not end, and that it is time to stop the shooting and hold someone accountable. He was responding to an Israeli attack on a UNRWA school in the Gaza Strip that killed 14 people, including 6 UNRWA staff members. The World Health Organization has announced that a quarter of the people injured in the war are suffering from 'life-changing injuries', with many requiring 'huge' prosthetics and rehabilitation services. The organization has stated that at least 22,500 people will need rehabilitation services now and in the coming years. The UNRWA representative in Gaza, Rick Brennan, has stated that the 'huge increase in rehabilitation needs is happening as the destruction of the health system continues'. The organization has estimated that there are between 13,455 and 17,550 'serious limb injuries'.

The bills cover various aspects of AI, including transparency, accountability, and regulation. The California AI Transparency Act requires providers of publicly accessible AI systems to disclose when content has been generated or modified by AI. The Artificial Intelligence Training Data Transparency Act mandates that developers of generative AI systems publicly disclose information about the data used to train their models. The Generative Artificial Intelligence Accountability Act requires the California Office of Emergency Services to conduct a risk analysis of potential threats posed by generative AI. Other bills address issues such as AI in healthcare, consumer privacy, and telecommunications. Governor Newsom vetoed Senate Bill 1047, which aimed to prevent 'critical harms' associated with AI, citing concerns about the high quantitative thresholds outlined in the bill. The veto may lead to similar proposals in future legislative sessions. Colorado and Utah have also enacted laws related to AI, with Colorado's Senate Bill 205 mandating that developers and deployers of high-risk AI systems take reasonable care to prevent algorithmic discrimination, and Utah's Senate Bill 149 establishing a regulatory framework for the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies within Utah.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[jdsupra.com](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/a-view-from-california-one-important-8750570/)\n\n**The Paralyzing Scientific Fact that will Happen in 2045 and Change the World Completely**\nAccording to experts in technology, artificial intelligence (AI) will equal human intelligence by 2029. However, this is not the only prediction, as they also claim that in 21 years, humans will be able to merge with computers and achieve 'singularity'. Raymond Kurzweil, Google's director of engineering, states that we will reach singularity by 2045. This term can be defined as a point in space-time where natural laws do not apply or are uncertain, like inside a black hole. The fusion could be developed through nanobots that will enter the brain through capillaries, allowing people to search and access information instantly and unconsciously, similar to having a smartphone in their head. As a result, AI will begin to expand on a large scale.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 08:01 PM\nSource:[El Heraldo de M�xico](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/tecnologia/2024/11/5/el-paralizante-hecho-cientifico-que-sucedera-en-2045-que-cambiara-el-mundo-por-completo-651200.html)\n\n**# Essential Guidelines for Safely Implementing Generative AI: Key Steps for Effective Governance**\nGenerative AI, which can create new content such as text, images, and music, has seen rapid advancements. However, its deployment must be carefully governed to ensure safety, ethical use, and compliance with legal standards. Essential guidelines for safely implementing generative AI include understanding its capabilities and limitations, establishing clear objectives and use cases, and addressing bias and fairness, accuracy and reliability, and ethical concerns. According to experts, it is crucial to define the purpose of the AI, such as enhancing creativity or automating repetitive tasks, to guide the development and deployment process. 'The ability to generate realistic content raises ethical questions, such as the potential for misuse in creating fake news, deepfakes, or other forms of disinformation,' said experts. 'Generative AI models are powerful, but they are not infallible. They can generate highly realistic content, but they can also produce biased, misleading, or harmful outputs.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 05:02 PM\nSource:[zephyrnet.com](https://zephyrnet.com/4026569-2/)\n\n**In 2024, the Powerful Potential of AI Took Hold**\nIn 2024, the potential of AI in government has become more evident, with innovative applications emerging in areas like emergency response, citizen services, and wildfire detection. However, the growing realization of AI's potential risks has also led to the creation of task forces and councils to establish guidelines and policies for its use. The GovAI Coalition, founded in San Jose in late 2023, has grown rapidly with over 350 agencies as members, offering resources like AI fact sheets and use case templates. Meanwhile, agencies are pushing for accountability through measures like AI inventories and dedicated AI leadership positions. However, experts warn that without thorough data governance and hygiene, AI initiatives risk becoming expensive failures. The year has also seen concerns about AI's darker side, including amplified cyber attacks and a potential digital divide. Governments are playing a crucial role in addressing these concerns, with public libraries offering workshops and resources to empower citizens to understand and harness AI's potential.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[govtech.com](https://www.govtech.com/artificial-intelligence/in-2024-the-powerful-potential-of-ai-took-hold)\n\n**Webinar: EU AI Regulation in Human Resources**\nThe integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in human resources offers significant potential, but also raises substantial legal and ethical challenges.

Two key bills, SB 942 and AB 2013, will take effect on January 1, 2026. SB 942 requires providers of generative AI systems to disclose metadata associated with AI-generated content, including the name of the provider, the name and version number of the GenAI system, the time and date the content was created or altered, and a unique identifier. AB 2013 requires developers of generative AI systems to post documentation on their website about the data used to train their systems. The bills aim to promote greater transparency from companies working in the AI field, allowing users to knowingly interact with AI-generated content and make informed choices. Companies subject to these laws may need to review their practices by December 31, 2025, to ensure compliance. 'Covered providers' must make tools available at no cost to users of AI systems to determine whether image, video or audio content has been created or altered by an AI system. 'Latent disclosure' refers to metadata associated with AI-generated content, while 'manifest disclosure' requires users to be informed that the content was created by an AI in a clear and conspicuous manner. 'Developers' must post documentation about the data used to train their generative AI systems, including exceptions for substantial modifications made before January 1, 2022. The rapid growth of AI-generated content poses numerous challenges, including the increasing difficulty for consumers to distinguish this type of content from human-created content. California aims to promote greater transparency from companies working in this field so that users can knowingly interact with AI-generated content and make informed choices. 'A covered provider that violates the requirements set out in the bill will be liable to a fine of $5,000 per violation.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 12:51 PM\nSource:[Lexology](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=8fe6b6ed-cdca-4d6c-b306-6acf66bf4ace)\n\n**European Union Introduces New Law to Regulate Artificial Intelligence**\nThe European Union has introduced a new law, (UE) 2024/1689, to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) and ensure its safe and responsible use.

In Poland, work is underway to implement some of the AI Act's provisions through a national law and the EU's DORA regulation, which governs the use of external technology providers, including AI-based solutions, by financial institutions. In this context, attention should be drawn to the upcoming changes regarding systems of artificial intelligence used to assess creditworthiness, which are increasingly used by lenders. The new regulations classify systems used to assess creditworthiness as high-risk AI systems, as mentioned in Article 6 of the AI Act and Annex III to the regulation. The AI Act requires lenders to meet a range of obligations when using AI to assess creditworthiness, including: '...to ensure that the system is designed and developed in a way that respects the rights and freedoms of natural persons, and to ensure that the system is transparent and explainable.' Additionally, according to Article 27 of the AI Act, financial institutions will be required to conduct an assessment of the consequences of high-risk AI systems on fundamental rights and present the results to the supervisory authority. Financial institutions should also consider that the use of AI systems does not constitute a violation of the list of prohibited practices mentioned in Article 5 of the AI Act. In Poland, work has also begun on a law that will clarify some of the AI Act's provisions. As part of pre-consultations with the Ministry of Digital Affairs, the postulates of social organizations regarding the establishment of a Polish AI authority were presented, resulting in the adoption of a position on the establishment of the Artificial Intelligence Supervision Commission, which has a collegiate character and consists of representatives of other supervisory bodies. It is also worth mentioning that in Poland, work is underway on a law amending certain laws to ensure the operational digital resilience of the financial sector, ensuring the proper application of the DORA regulation, whose provisions may also apply to the use of AI systems by financial institutions. The project of the law provides for, among other things, the appointment of the Financial Supervision Commission as the supervisory body in the field of ensuring the operational digital resilience of the financial sector, as well as the introduction of changes to the law on the national cyber security system, including in the area of reporting on serious ICT incidents and cyber threats.

The law will be enforced by the California Attorney General, a city attorney, or a county counsel, and provides for civil penalties of $5,000 per day if a covered provider is found to be in violation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 06:07 AM\nSource:[Mondaq](https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/new-technology/1521816/new-california-law-will-require-ai-transparency-and-disclosure-measures)\n\n**EU Promotes Voluntary Pact on Artificial Intelligence, Excluding Meta and Apple**\nMore than a hundred companies, including Google, Microsoft, Open AI, and Amazon, have signed the voluntary pact promoted by the European Commission to develop artificial intelligence that respects ethical principles. However, companies like X, Meta, and Apple have not joined, and have even delayed the introduction of their AI systems in the European market due to doubts about the new EU laws regulating the sector. According to Thomas Regnier, the spokesperson for the European Commission's Market Interior, 'The pact on artificial intelligence is a voluntary instrument. Of course, we invite all companies to participate. The number will increase in the future, but it's up to private companies to make their own decisions.' The EU has also launched an industrial initiative to encourage companies to develop their AI systems. The pact will be implemented in parallel with the gradual rollout of the AI law, which will prohibit or permit the use of AI technology based on the risk it poses to people. From February, systems that categorize people based on their political, religious, philosophical, or racial beliefs, or their sexual orientation, will be prohibited. Additionally, AI systems that score people based on their behavior or personal characteristics, or those that manipulate human behavior, will also be banned. In August 2025, the criteria for transparency that AI generative systems must comply with will come into effect. These models will have to clearly indicate whether a text, song, or image has been generated through AI and ensure that the data used to train the systems respects copyright rights.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 11:51 PM\nSource:[bitlydns.net](https://dqtjif.bitlydns.net/2024/09/25/google-y-open-ai-firman-el-pacto-de-inteligencia-artificial-de-la-ue-que-evitan-meta-o-x)\n\n**Tech Giants Push for Lenient AI Law in Europe**\nThe world's largest technology companies are in a final push to influence the European Union to adopt a more lenient approach to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Law, approved in May 2024. The new legislation aims to regulate AI comprehensively, but it is still unclear how the rules will be applied to general-purpose AI systems, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. Companies fear that strict enforcement of the law could lead to billions of dollars in fines. The code of conduct accompanying the AI Law is being developed with the participation of companies, academics, and other stakeholders. The European Union has received over 1,000 requests to collaborate in this process, a number considered exceptionally high, according to Reuters. Boniface de Champris, senior policy manager at the commercial organization CCIA Europe, whose members include Amazon, Google, and Meta, said, 'The code of conduct is crucial. If we get it right, we can continue to innovate.' However, he also warned that if the code is too restrictive or specific, it will become very difficult. The regulation of AI raises questions about the use of data by companies like Stability AI and OpenAI to train their algorithms. The debate centers on the use of copyrighted materials without the consent of their authors, which can lead to legal disputes. To mitigate these risks, the new European legislation requires companies to disclose detailed reports on the data used to train their models. While some argue that transparency can compromise valuable commercial secrets, others claim that content creators have the right to know if their work is being used without authorization. Technology companies like Google and Amazon are also seeking to participate in the development of the code of conduct, claiming that their expertise can contribute to the effectiveness of the new rules. However, there are criticisms that these giants are trying to avoid transparency. Maximilian Gahntz, of the Mozilla Foundation, told Reuters that he believes the AI Law is an important opportunity to increase transparency in the data collection and use practices of large technology companies, revealing processes that have been unclear until now. Small European technology startups have expressed concerns that the new regulations may stifle innovation. 'We insist that these obligations need to be manageable and, if possible, adapted for startups,' said Maxime Ricard, policy manager at Allied for Startups. The code of conduct will be finalized in early 2025, and technology companies will have until August of that year to adapt to the new guidelines.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 12:30 PM\nSource:[IT Forum](https://itforum.com.br/noticias/gigantes-tecnologia-flexibilizar-lei-de-ia-ue)\n\n**It's almost too late to protect our elections from AI — Congress must act now**\nThe 2024 general election is approaching, and artificial intelligence (AI) is already being used to create deceptive content, such as 'deepfakes', that can mislead voters. For example, AI-generated robocalls mimicking President Biden's voice told Democratic voters not to vote in the primary, and a deepfake message falsely depicted a Chicago mayoral candidate saying, 'back in my day, cops would kill 17 or 18 people and nobody would bat an eye.' These examples may soon appear amateurish as AI technology advances. To prevent electoral mischief, Congress must establish guardrails around AI use in elections. The Federal Election Commission has issued an interpretive rule, but it is inadequate to address the challenges posed by AI. New federal laws are needed to prohibit ads that fraudulently deceive and manipulate voters and require disclaimers on political ads that use AI. Congress is considering several bills, including the Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act and the AI Transparency in Elections Act, but time is running short before the 2024 election.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 04:00 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/4889200-ai-threat-deepfake-elections)\n\n**AI-generated content could be easier to identify under new state law aimed at spotting fakes**\nA new California law, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, requires companies with over one million monthly users to make it easier to identify AI-generated content. The law, authored by state Sen. Josh Becker, does not specify how this 'watermarking' will work technically, but rather pushes companies to develop solutions by January 1, 2026. Companies will have to offer tools for third-party developers to create their own detectors, said Becker. However, University of Chicago Assistant Professor Aloni Cohen noted that 'we don't know yet the extent to which this is technically feasible or reasonable.' Krishna Gade, CEO of Fiddler AI, said detection software will require 'significant investment' from AI companies. The law also requires companies to give users the ability to emblazon a visible watermark across AI-generated content. Newsom signed a package of AI bills, including laws requiring large social media sites to label or remove election-related deepfakes and ban unlabeled deepfakes of candidates 120 days before an election.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 12:50 AM\nSource:[San Francisco Chronicle](http://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/ai-generated-content-easier-identify-new-state-law-19777954.php)\n\n**California Governor Signs Laws to Combat 'Deepfakes' in Elections**\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom signed three laws on Tuesday to combat the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to create fake images or videos in political ads before the 2024 elections. A new law, which takes effect immediately, makes it illegal to create and publish 'deepfakes' related to elections 120 days before and 60 days after the electoral process. It also allows courts to stop the distribution of the materials and impose civil penalties. Newsom said, 'Protecting the integrity of elections is essential to democracy, and it's crucial that we ensure that AI is not used to undermine public trust through disinformation, especially in the current tense political climate.' The laws also require social media platforms to remove misleading content under a pioneering law that will be enacted next year. Newsom also signed a law that requires political campaigns to publicly disclose if they are publishing ads with AI-altered materials. The governor signed the laws amidst applause during a conversation with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff at a software company event in San Francisco. The new laws reaffirm California's position as a leader in AI regulation in the US, particularly in the fight against electoral falsifications. California was the first state in the US to ban election-related videos and images in 2019. The state's technology and AI-related measures have been used as models for lawmakers across the country, said industry experts. 'There are less than 50 days to the general elections and it's urgent to protect against digitally altered and misleading content that can interfere with elections,' said Assemblywoman Gail Pellerin, author of the law that prohibits electoral falsifications. 'California is taking a stance against the manipulative use of technology to deceive voters,' she added.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 18, 2024 02:36 AM\nSource:[Telemundo 52](https://www.telemundo52.com/noticias/california/california-ley-deepfakes-electorales/2691088)\n\n**Council of Europe Adopts International Treaty on Artificial Intelligence**\nThe Council of Europe approved an international treaty on September 5 to ensure that artificial intelligence systems, both public and private, respect human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. This legally binding text is the first of its kind on the international stage. The treaty, titled 'Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence, Human Rights, Democracy, and the Rule of Law', requires companies to clearly indicate whether users interact with a human or AI. It covers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, promoting innovation while reducing the risks associated with fundamental rights violations. This convention is the first international, legally binding regulation in the field of artificial intelligence. All states that adhere to it will be required to incorporate it into their national legislation. The treaty is designed to be compatible with the AI Act, a law adopted by the European Parliament in March 2024, which regulates AI systems in Europe. The treaty imposes transparency and control obligations on AI systems, making decisions taken by these systems understandable and accessible to those concerned. Users must also be informed when interacting with AI. However, exceptions are provided for reasons of national security, public order, or in the context of research and development. Emily Turrettini, a journalist specializing in new technologies, said, 'A better transparency of AI systems should allow for the identification of responsibility in case of human rights violations, and offer affected individuals the possibility to contest decisions made by these technologies.' \nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 11, 2024 09:30 AM\nSource:[Bilan](https://www.bilan.ch/story/bil-opinion-emily-755650587222)\n\n**The Risks of Artificial Intelligence in the Battlefield: A Call for Regulation**\nThe development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is raising concerns about its use in the battlefield. Recently, several countries signed an international treaty on the use and standards of AI for public and private sectors. The agreement, signed by Andorra, Georgia, Iceland, Norway, Moldova, San Marino, the UK, Israel, the US, and the EU, aims to ensure that AI systems are 'totally consistent with human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.' However, the use of AI in military contexts is a different story. The development of lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) has sparked debates and concerns. Although the UN's 2023 Agenda for Peace recommended that countries create a legal instrument to ban the use of autonomous lethal weapons by 2026, the current geopolitical context has hindered progress. LAWS are capable of identifying targets and engaging and destroying them autonomously, without human intervention. While semi-autonomous weapons, such as drones and missiles, are already being used in battlefields, LAWS are a different story. There is no evidence of LAWS being used in real-world conflicts, but the technology to create them is already available. This raises serious ethical, moral, and legal concerns. As Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) depicts, a machine like HAL 9000 could decide to eliminate human life. Who would be responsible for crimes of war committed by LAWS? The international community has already banned inhumane weapons, such as chemical weapons. It's time to follow this example and ban LAWS to prevent the indiscriminate use of AI as a powerful and potentially uncontrollable new military technology.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 09, 2024 12:41 PM\nSource:[Gazeta do Povo](https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/vozes/paulo-filho/da-ficcao-a-realidade-os-riscos-da-inteligencia-artificial-no-campo-de-batalha)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

Kalshi now ranks first in Apple's finance app category and third overall among free apps, while Polymarket is the fourth-highest ranking app in the finance app category. This represents both apps' highest placement to date, likely driven by interest in betting on election outcomes. Kalshi's market for the 2024 U.S. presidential winner, featuring former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, grew to $247 million, while Polymarket maintains $3.26 billion in total betting volume for the same market. Since launching in 2020, Polymarket has amassed $5.15 billion in cumulative trading volume.

One option is to bet on the outcome using platforms like Polymarket, which has gained popularity since the last US election. Despite facing criticism and a $1.4 million fine in 2022 for allowing bets on political events, Polymarket has continued to operate. Recently, the CFTC launched an attack on the prediction platform KalshiEX LLC, but a court ruled in favor of the company, allowing it to offer contracts on its platform. Robinhood has also recognized the potential of betting on the US election and has initiated its own efforts. As a result, Polymarket users in the US may once again be able to place bets on the election. According to Polymarket, the current chance of a Trump win is 65.9%. Investors can also consider investing in cryptocurrency mining companies in the US, as Trump has promised to make the country a leader in this field. Other cryptocurrency options, such as Coinbase and Solana, may also benefit from a Trump presidency. Additionally, PolitiFi-memecoins, which are seen as an alternative to betting, have gained popularity and offer the potential for higher returns. However, some of these coins have already reached high valuations, and new variants may not be as innovative or useful. The project FreeDum Fighters, which combines both Republican and Democratic tokens, has gained traction and raised $332,017 in its presale. Analysts suggest that investing in the PolitiFi-token of Harris could provide a hedge against the dominance of Trump-coins.

Eligible users, including individual investors who are US citizens and have a margin account or level 2/3 options trading approval, will be able to trade on the likelihood of each candidate winning. The competition among prediction platforms is heating up, with Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour stating that their platform has become the leader in the finance App Store and has surpassed Facebook and Uber in global rankings. Kalshi's average bet size is around $300-400, while some users are creating positions worth millions of dollars. The platform offers much higher liquidity compared to Robinhood. The court's decision in favor of Kalshi is shaping the industry, with other major platforms like Interactive Brokers also entering the election contract market despite CFTC's objections.

As a regulated platform, Kalshi had to wait until it won in court to participate in election betting, whereas Polymarket was able to start earlier.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2024 05:13 PM\nSource:[CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/21/us-election-betting-kalshis-polymarket-rival-quickly-gets-traction/)\n\n**CFTC Calls Court Ruling in Kalshi Case an 'Error', Files Appeal**\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed an appeal in the case against Kalshi, a market for predictions. The CFTC believes that the court's previous decision was an 'error' and has asked it to be overturned. The CFTC argues that the court misinterpreted the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, thereby limiting the Commission's authority. The regulator also reiterated its argument that bets on political events are a form of gambling, citing the use of specialized terminology. According to the CFTC, '...the Commission found that contracts can negatively impact the integrity of elections or the perception of election integrity by creating financial incentives for voting (including organized groups) for candidates or by stimulating the spread of disinformation to influence markets, and that markets can be used to influence the perception of elections.' Kalshi's team has not commented on the situation. However, the platform's founder, Tarek Mansour, noted on his X page that Kalshi has surpassed the popularity of Fidelity and Robinhood clients: 'Kalshi just flipped both Robinhood and Fidelity on the Appstore.' In September 2024, the platform won a lawsuit against the CFTC, but the regulator immediately filed an appeal, requesting a temporary ban that prevented the platform from opening bets on political events. This measure was later lifted, but the CFTC's appeal remains in place. Kalshi is currently accepting bets, but this may change in the future pending the upcoming rehearing.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 18, 2024 09:02 AM\nSource:[incrypted.com](https://incrypted.com/cftc-nazvala-reshenye-suda-v-dele-rynka-prognozov-kalshi-oshybkoj/)\n\n**Top 4 Staking Platforms 2024: Earn up to $1,610/month**\nThe article highlights the top 4 staking platforms in 2024, with CryptoBox standing out as the most rewarding and secure option.

Trump has repeatedly stated that he plans to dismantle Biden's AI policy framework, which was established through an executive order in October 2023. The Biden administration's AI policy aimed to address security risks and real-world safety impacts of AI, but critics, including some Republicans, have argued that the policy's reporting requirements are too onerous and could scare away innovators. Trump's allies have expressed concerns that the policy's focus on AI's physical safety risks could lead to censorship of conservative speech. Some Republicans have suggested that NIST should focus on AI's physical safety risks, but have shied away from endorsing new restrictions on AI. The fate of the U.S. AI Safety Institute (AISI), which was established by the Biden administration, is also unclear. Experts predict that Trump's victory will lead to a light-touch regulatory regime, but may embolden state governments to try to fill the void. State-led efforts to regulate AI are already underway, with several states introducing AI-related legislation. The global regulation of AI may suffer as a consequence of new controls, and the economic impact of potential tariffs on the tech necessary to build AI could be significant.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 05:39 PM\nSource:[techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/what-trumps-victory-could-mean-for-ai-regulation/)\n\n**Abortion Did Not Play As Big A Role In The US Election As Many Anticipated. What Might Happen On This Issue Now?**\nDespite predictions that abortion would be a major issue in the 2024 US election, it did not play as big a role as anticipated. However, voters were still concerned about abortion, with seven out of 10 state reproductive rights ballot initiatives passing. A Trump victory may have significant consequences for abortion access in the US and beyond, including the potential for a federal abortion ban, the enforcement of the Comstock Act, and the appointment of conservative Supreme Court justices. This could lead to a national minimum standard for abortion, making it illegal after a certain point, and potentially even prohibiting the mailing of abortion-related drugs or paraphernalia. Additionally, a Trump presidency will likely reintroduce the global gag rule, which prevents foreign NGOs from providing information or referrals for legal abortion. This could have dire consequences for global reproductive health initiatives. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[menafn.com](https://menafn.com/1108859013/Abortion-Did-Not-Play-As-Big-A-Role-In-The-US-Election-As-Many-Anticipated-What-Might-Happen-On-This-Issue-Now)\n\n**AI Export Controls: Balancing National Security and AI Innovation**\nRecent reports have revealed that foreign companies affiliated with U.S. adversaries, such as China, can access restricted artificial intelligence (AI) chips via cloud-based methods and advanced AI models. To address these gaps, two bipartisan groups of lawmakers introduced the Remote Access Security Act and the Enhancing National Frameworks for Overseas Critical Exports Act (ENFORCE Act), which would restrict remote access to advanced AI chips and give the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security authority to control exports of covered AI systems. However, these bills may be overly broad and limit innovation and development of AI capabilities in the United States, and lawmakers should carefully weigh these trade-offs as they consider new export-control legislation. 'Lawmakers should strive to find the best possible balance of mitigating foreign security risks and allowing U.S. AI innovation to thrive,' said a report. 'Doing so will require AI export controls that can more precisely differentiate between AI embedded in general-use applications and models that may pose security risks.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[americanactionforum.org](https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/ai-export-controls-balancing-national-security-and-ai-innovation/)\n\n**US Imposes Strict Restrictions on AI and Chip Investments in China**\nThe U.S. government has imposed new restrictions on American companies investing in Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductor technologies, aiming to limit China's access to advanced tech that could bolster its military capabilities. The regulations, authorized by President Biden, prohibit U.S. investments in areas like AI, quantum computing, and advanced chip manufacturing, and require companies to report any other investments to the U.S. government. The rules target three key areas within China's tech sector: semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technologies, and specific artificial intelligence systems, deemed vital for next-generation military, cybersecurity, and intelligence applications.

The new rules, aimed at protecting national security, establish restrictions on the flow of personal data and investments in strategic sectors, seeking to prevent the malicious use of these technologies by foreign governments. The US has announced a new package of regulations aimed at limiting the transfer of sensitive data and investments in strategic technologies such as artificial intelligence to rival countries like China and Russia. These measures are part of a broader effort by the White House to strengthen national security and prevent critical data and technological expertise from falling into the hands of hostile governments. The new data transfer rules, presented by the Biden administration, establish precise limits on how many data sets can be transferred to individuals or companies in countries like China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and Cuba. For example, it will be prohibited to transfer more than 100 sets of genomic data of American citizens in a 12-month period. Similar limits apply to biometric, location, and financial data of tens of thousands of Americans. Companies that violate these rules, including those that sell or broker data, could face civil and criminal penalties. The government has highlighted how access to these data by foreign governments could fuel a wide range of damaging activities, such as cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, and surveillance on top US national security officials. Parallel to this, the US is preparing new rules that ban certain investments in technologies like artificial intelligence and semiconductors in China. These restrictions aim to prevent American investments from supporting the development of military technologies in hostile countries, especially in the context of global competitions in advanced sectors like AI and quantum computing. The Treasury Department has already proposed a regulatory framework to require formal notifications for investments in sensitive technologies, ensuring that American capital is not used to accelerate the development of systems that could threaten US security. Some exceptions may be allowed, such as investments in mutual funds or publicly traded securities, but the government is determined to maintain strict control over transactions that could compromise the US technological superiority.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[formiche.net](https://formiche.net/2024/10/dati-ia-biden-cina/)\n\n**US Prepares to Ban Certain AI Investments in China**\nThe US is preparing to implement new regulations that will ban certain types of American artificial intelligence (AI) investments in China.

The rules are currently in the final stages of review, as indicated by a recent government announcement. This development suggests that the restrictions could be promulgated soon. The regulations are the result of an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023, aimed at preventing American investors from inadvertently supporting the Chinese military through the transfer of AI expertise and other sensitive technologies. These rules not only prohibit certain investments but also require American investors to declare certain AI-related investments to the Department of the Treasury. The rules focus on outgoing investments to China in the fields of AI, semiconductors, microelectronics, and quantum computing. According to the Office of Management and Budget, the rules are currently under review, a step that usually precedes the publication of such regulations within a week or so. Laura Black, a former Treasury official and now a lawyer at Akin Gump in Washington, has speculated that the goal is to publish the rules before the next US presidential election on November 5. Black has also noted that the Treasury Department's office overseeing these regulations typically allows a minimum of 30 days before the new rules take effect. The Department of the Treasury had previously published proposed rules in June, which included a number of exceptions, and opened them up for public comment. The proposed rules required American individuals and businesses to evaluate which of their transactions would be subject to these new restrictions. The proposed rules, as previously outlined, would prohibit transactions in AI for certain applications, including systems trained with a specified level of computational power. They would also require declarations for transactions related to the development of AI or semiconductor systems that are not already prohibited. The proposed exceptions included publicly traded securities such as index funds or mutual funds, certain investments in limited partnerships, and certain syndicated loan financings.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 21, 2024 06:09 PM\nSource:[Investing.com France](https://fr.investing.com/news/economy-news/les-etatsunis-sappretent-a-restreindre-les-investissements-en-ia-en-chine-93CH-2607156)\n\n**US to Restrict AI Investments in China**\nThe US government plans to restrict investments in China's artificial intelligence (AI) sector.

The move aims to limit the ability of these countries to form a global AI landscape. The restrictions would restrict the issuance of export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security. The US is concerned that countries in the Persian Gulf are showing growing interest in AI data centers and have the financial resources to fund this interest. The export restrictions on microchips were initially aimed at China. The Biden administration has already restricted the supply of AI chips from companies like Nvidia and AMD to over 40 countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia due to concerns that their products could be diverted to China. Some US officials are now considering export licenses as a tool for achieving broader diplomatic goals, including asking key companies to cut ties with China in order to gain access to US technology. However, China is not the only country that concerns the US. Governments around the world are striving for 'sovereign AI' - the ability to create and launch their own AI systems. According to Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, this has become a key factor in the demand for advanced processors. Nvidia's chips are the gold standard for data center operators, making the company the most valuable chipmaker in the world and the main beneficiary of the AI boom. Meanwhile, China is working on developing its own advanced semiconductors, although they still lag behind the best US chips. However, some US officials are concerned that if Huawei Technologies or another foreign manufacturer were to offer a viable alternative to Nvidia's chips, it could weaken the US ability to shape the global AI landscape. The agency notes that the current administration may not be able to introduce a full-fledged new policy of restrictions before the end of President Biden's term. Additionally, the agency estimates that implementing such measures could be challenging and may complicate US diplomatic relations.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 07:36 AM\nSource:[���.Ru // �������, �����, �������� ���������� ���, ������-������� ���, ��������� �������](https://www.ntv.ru/novosti/2854479/)\n\n**US Considers Restricting Export of AI Chips to Certain Countries**\nThe US administration is considering restricting the export of AI chipsets produced by Nvidia, AMD, and other American companies to certain countries, according to Bloomberg.

According to the company, this is achieved by providing a reference string. ChatGPT explained the concept, saying, 'If you know something of the answer beforehand (like when you change the code a bit), you can give the model a prediction that makes it answer faster. Use smaller models: Larger models take longer. Smaller models can work just as well if you give them more specific instructions. Fewer tokens: Tokens are small units of text. The fewer tokens generated, the faster it goes. Ask the model to give short answers or cut out unnecessary text. Fewer input tokens: Input data (what you give the model) also counts. Shorter text in questions can sometimes reduce wait time, but the effect is often small. Make fewer requests: Every time you ask the model something, it takes time. If you have multiple tasks, you can ask for everything in one request. Parallelization: If tasks don't need to be done in sequence, you can ask for them at the same time. This saves time. Use wait time wisely: Wait time feels shorter if the user sees progress, like a loading bar or a spinner. Consider alternatives to AI: Sometimes simple solutions work better than AI. For example, standard messages or pre-written answers can save time and be just as good.'

The company announced on Thursday that it is releasing a search function for paid ChatGPT users, but plans to expand it to all users in the future. The new search engine was previously tested in July for a small group of users and publishers. The original ChatGPT, released in 2022, was trained on massive online text datasets but was unable to respond to questions about current events not included in its training data. This new feature could put OpenAI in direct competition with Google, which updated its search engine in May to include AI-generated written summaries at the top of search results. These summaries aim to quickly answer a user's search query, eliminating the need to click on a link and visit another website for additional information. However, the update has led to incorrect results, highlighting the risks associated with outsourcing search to AI chatbots prone to errors known as hallucinations. Some news outlets have expressed concern about the intention of AI developers to have their chatbots relay news gathered by professional journalists. The New York Times, one of several publications that have sued OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft for copyright infringement, has expressed concern about the move. OpenAI stated in its blog on Thursday that its new search engine was created in collaboration with news partners, including The Associated Press and News Corp.

The next major breakthrough from OpenAI is called Orion, which will be launched in December 2024, according to The Verge. This new model will not be directly linked to the ChatGPT chatbot initially and will be provided to its partners for integration into their products. Microsoft, a major financial partner, will create a cozy nest for Orion in its Azure cloud infrastructure starting in November. The new AI aims to become a successor to GPT-4, but it remains to be seen if it's a partial evolution or the famous GPT-5, which will mark a significant progress. Orion is expected to be 100 times more performant than GPT-4, but without the specific reasoning capabilities of the recent o1 model. OpenAI's goal is to eventually combine its different language models, or LLM, to create a general artificial intelligence (AGI) that can surpass human capabilities in all areas. The o1 model was used to provide training data for Orion, which was completed in September. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has already mentioned the arrival of the Orion AI in a message on the social network X, referring to 'the next raising of the winter constellations', a direct reference to the Orion constellation, visible in the Northern Hemisphere during winter.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 10:10 AM\nSource:[generation-nt.com](https://www.generation-nt.com/actualites/openai-intelligence-artificielle-nouveau-modele-orion-decembre-2051941)\n\n**Top 10 Language Models in October 2024: OpenAI Dominates, Chinese Models Rise**\nOpenAI continues to dominate the market for generative AI, with its latest models taking the top three spots in the Chatbot Arena, a reputable ranking system that objectively evaluates model performance based on user contributions.

OpenAI's o1-mini model ranked third, while its GPT-4o-2024-05-13 and GPT-4o-mini-2024-07-18 models ranked sixth and seventh, respectively. Other top-ranked models include Gemini-1.5-Pro-Exp-0827 from Google, Grok-2-08-13 from xAI, and Claude 3.5 from Sonnet Anthropic.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 04, 2024 01:41 PM\nSource:[Tunisie Numerique](https://www.tunisienumerique.com/top-10-des-meilleures-ia-en-octobre-2024/)\n\n**Google is taking its rivalry with OpenAI to another level**\nGoogle is reportedly making progress in developing artificial intelligence (AI) models that can 'reason' like humans, according to Bloomberg. The company's teams have been working on software that enables large language models (LLMs) to solve multistep problems using a series of intermediate reasoning steps, similar to human thought processes. This technique, called chain-of-thought prompting, allows models to consider similar prompts and respond with more complex answers. Google's efforts come as a response to OpenAI's o1 model, which also uses chain-of-thought prompting. OpenAI's o1 model can solve more complex math- and computer-programming-related inquiries, but lacks some features of ChatGPT, such as web browsing and file uploads. Google is also working on improving its Gemini chatbot's'reasoning' abilities, with the latest model, 1.5 Flash, offering quicker and more helpful responses.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 03:14 PM\nSource:[Quartz](https://qz.com/google-reasoning-ai-model-compete-openai-chatgpt-gemini-1851663139)\n\n**Google Elevates Rivalry with OpenAI to Next Level with AI Reasoning Models**\nGoogle is reportedly working on taking its rivalry with OpenAI to the next level by developing AI models that can 'reason'. According to Bloomberg, Google's teams have made significant progress in recent months on software for AI models that resemble human reasoning capabilities. Google has been focusing on 'reasoning' capabilities in large language models (LLMs), including its work on chain-of-thought techniques. This technique, which Google is using, allows LLMs to solve problems in multiple steps using 'intermediate reasoning steps', similar to how a human would. The models with this software take longer to respond to requests, as they consider similar prompts that are summarized in a response. Chain-of-thought techniques give models the ability to solve more complex requests related to math and computer programming. OpenAI is also using chain-of-thought techniques for its new o1 model, which was released in September. However, Google has since caught up and is now releasing its own competitors to OpenAI's products. Unlike the current version of ChatGPT, OpenAI's new model does not yet have some of its 'useful' features, such as web navigation and file and image downloads. The o1 models are 'designed to spend more time thinking before responding', according to the company. The models, which are available in preview in ChatGPT and via the company's API, can 'reason' on more complex tasks and problems in science, coding, and math than OpenAI's previous models. Google is also working to improve the 'reasoning' capabilities of its chatbot Gemini. In July, Google launched its fastest and most cost-effective model, 1.5 Flash, available in the free version of Gemini. With 1.5 Flash, Gemini will have 'faster and more useful responses', according to Google, adding that users will notice improvements in Gemini's reasoning and image processing capabilities.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 03:14 PM\nSource:[Quartz](https://fr.qz.com/modele-d-ia-google-reasoning-compete-openai-chat-gpt-ge-1851663293)\n\n**OpenAI o1 Becomes the Best AI Model, Outperforming Google and Anthropic**\nOpenAI's latest model, o1, has surpassed all other Large Language Models (LLM) and taken the top spot in the Chatbot Arena ranking, outperforming both other OpenAI models and its main competitors, Google, xAI, and Anthropic. OpenAI o1 was released in a preliminary version just ten days ago. According to the Chatbot Arena ranking, users evaluate the results of LLM programs, and the platform calculates a total score and evaluates models in separate categories, such as languages, mathematics, and programming. OpenAI o1 now has 1335 points and has left all other LLMs behind in the ranking. The smaller version of OpenAI o1 mini, with reduced performance and lower usage costs, has also surpassed almost all other AI models, except for the Gemini 1.5 Pro from Google, which is slightly better. As stated by the provider, OpenAI o1 is capable of solving problems at the level of a Ph.D. candidate, passing through processes that imitate human thinking. LLM can show users the steps to solve problems. Currently, paid subscribers of ChatGPT can already use AI. OpenAI o1 has sparked controversy, as the company has already classified AI as a medium-risk category. Experts can use it to create biological weapons. 'We recognize that these new capabilities may become the basis for dangerous applications,' says the OpenAI developer. However, there are no talks about banning LLM, although authorities are closely monitoring new developments. OpenAI, which plans to attract massive funding of $6.5 billion, may significantly outperform its competitors, particularly Google, which currently has the Gemini 1.5 version, and Anthropic, which recently released Claude 3.5. Not long ago, Grok from xAI, co-founded by Elon Musk, entered the top 10 ranking of the best AI models. Llama 3.1 and AI models from Mistral AI in France are significantly lagging behind.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 09:24 PM\nSource:[Overclockers.ru](https://overclockers.ru/blog/kosmos_news/show/181841/OpenAI-o1-uzhe-yavlyaetsya-luchshej-model-ju-II-operezhaya-Google-i-Anthropic)\n\n**How Tomorrow's Chatbots Will Reshape Our Daily Life**\nOpenAI's latest large language model, o1, has demonstrated reasoning capabilities rivaling Ph.D.-level experts in biology, physics, and chemistry.

Strong reasoning capabilities in LLMs may enhance AI tutors and educational apps, providing better assistance to students in subjects like math, coding, and physics. The applications equipped with LLMs hold strong promise for generating economic benefits, with optimistic projections suggesting that AI could add $1.2 trillion of GDP growth to $3.8 trillion in the U.S. However, embracing advanced chatbots also brings important ethical challenges and environmental concerns, and ensuring that these AI companions are safe and responsible is crucial.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 01:30 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/geruiwang/2024/09/24/how-tomorrows-chatbots-will-reshape-our-daily-life)\n\n**OpenAI o1: A Specialized AI Model for Complex Tasks**\nOpenAI's o1 is a new AI model designed for specific tasks, not a general improvement over previous models. It's a tool that excels in certain areas, such as complex problem-solving and multi-step reasoning. According to Andrew Mayne, one of the first users of the model, o1 is not a traditional chatbot, but rather a tool that requires clear input and can analyze context before providing a response. The model has been used to create games, applications, and even a climate prediction app in just a few minutes. However, o1 is slower and more expensive than other models, and its limitations include processing times of over 10 seconds for some queries. The model's advanced reasoning capabilities make it ideal for tasks like data science, coding, and complex math problems, but may not be the best choice for simpler tasks. In a math competition, o1 solved 83% of problems, compared to GPT-4o's 13%.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 02:00 PM\nSource:[WWWhatsnew](https://wwwhatsnew.com/2024/09/20/openai-o1-no-es-para-todos-pero-puede-ser-un-cambio-de-juego)\n\n**ChatGPT is more amazing than ever—but still oh so raw**\nChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, has made significant improvements since its release in 2022. However, it still has limitations and can be impenetrable in some ways. OpenAI has introduced a new LLM called OpenAI o1, which is optimized for complex reasoning tasks and has shown impressive results in competitive programming, math, and science problems. According to OpenAI, o1 ranks in the 89th percentile on competitive programming questions and exceeds human PhD-level accuracy on physics, biology, and chemistry problems. However, the arrival of o1 complicates the matter of choosing the right variant of ChatGPT for a particular purpose, as the different versions have different strengths and limitations. OpenAI's blog posts provide crucial details about the different models, but it can be challenging for users to determine which version to use. Ultimately, ChatGPT's 'research release' rawness is a double-edged sword, as it allows for experimentation and innovation, but also raises expectations and can lead to disappointment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2024 11:30 AM\nSource:[Fast](https://www.fastcompany.com/91192101/chatgpt-o1-4o-versions)\n\n**OpenAI o1: A New Era of Large Language Models**\nOpenAI is releasing a new series of Large Language Models (LLM) called OpenAI o1, also known as 'Strawberry', which promises to be able to reason and solve complex problems. The new platform is based on probabilistic mathematical models. According to OpenAI's tests, the system can outperform even the most skilled humans in solving complex questions in chemistry, biology, and physics. It also shows improvement in coding and mathematical fields. OpenAI o1 is currently in early preview and has been integrated into ChatGPT with two models: o1-preview and o1-mini. The new project aims to provide better responses to users while minimizing errors.

The models are available in ChatGPT for Plus and Team users, and will be available for ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu users next week. Developers with Tier 5 access will also be able to use the models.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 15, 2024 04:30 AM\nSource:[TecnoAndroid](https://www.tecnoandroid.it/2024/09/15/openai-o1-perche-molti-utenti-non-sanno-usarlo-1449318)\n\n**OpenAI Introduces o1, a Model Capable of Reasoning and Thinking**\nOpenAI, the company behind the popular ChatGPT, has introduced OpenAI o1, the first model in its series capable of 'reasoning' and 'thinking' its responses through mathematics and science to reduce errors. According to OpenAI, 'We trained these models to spend more time thinking about problems before responding, in a way very similar to how a person would. Through training, they learn to refine their thought process, try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes.' The new model uses the reinforcement learning technique, which teaches the system through rewards and penalties. As a result, OpenAI claims that the model should be more accurate and avoid 'hallucinations' (when it gives well-structured but false responses). In a demonstration, OpenAI showed the chatbot solving a complex puzzle, answering a graduate-level chemistry question, and diagnosing a disease based on a detailed patient report. The company also announced that the new model has achieved an 83% correct answer rate in a math classification exam, compared to the previous model's 13%.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 14, 2024 09:00 AM\nSource:[Diario de Yucatán](https://www.yucatan.com.mx/imagen/2024/09/14/modelo-de-ia-podria-razonar.html)\n\n**OpenAI Releases New Chatbot, 'o1', with Advanced AI Capabilities**\nOpenAI has released a new version of its chatbot, 'o1', which is a significant step towards its goal of developing 'artificial general intelligence', or AI that is similar to human intelligence. The new model is available in a beta version and can perform complex tasks, such as solving mathematical problems and generating text. In a test, 'o1' outperformed OpenAI's previous model, 'GPT-4o', in solving mathematical problems, achieving 83% accuracy compared to 13%. However, the new model is currently unable to process or generate non-text content. OpenAI has also tested 'o1' in a logical reasoning task, and it produced the same results as 'GPT-4o', but took longer to respond and provided more detailed answers. OpenAI has stated that 'o1' uses a series of ideas, like a human who can think for a long time before answering a difficult question. It also learns to recognize and correct its mistakes, divide complex tasks into simpler ones, and try different approaches when the first one fails. OpenAI is currently seeking to raise $150 billion in funding, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world. The company has already attracted investors such as Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple, which use OpenAI's technology in their systems. The company's chatbot, 'ChatGPT', has over 200 million active users per week, double the number it had last fall. OpenAI has also stated that 92% of the top 500 companies in the US use its products.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 14, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[MENAFN](https://menafn.com/arabic/1108673991/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF)\n\n**OpenAI Presents 'o1', a More Advanced AI Model with Reasoning Capabilities**\nOpenAI has presented 'o1', a more modern artificial intelligence model than ChatGPT, capable of reasoning its responses. According to the company, 'we train these models to spend more time thinking about problems before responding, in a way very similar to how a person would. Through training, they learn to refine their thought process, try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes', said the company in a statement published on Thursday. O1 uses a technique called reinforcement learning, which teaches the system through rewards and penalties. Unlike ChatGPT, this AI model not only imitates data patterns with potentially false information, but can reason and learn which methods lead to the correct response. OpenAI claims that this model should be more accurate and avoid 'hallucinations' - when it gives well-structured but false responses. According to OpenAI's research leader, Jerry Tworek, 'this model should be more precise and avoid these hallucinations.' In a demonstration for The New York Times, OpenAI showed the chatbot solving an acrostic, answering a Ph.D.-level chemistry question, and diagnosing a disease based on a detailed report of symptoms and patient history. The company notes that in a classification exam for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), GPT-4o (the previous model) correctly solved only 13% of the problems, while o1 achieved an 83% score. Tech giants like Google and Meta are building similar technologies, while Microsoft, OpenAI's partner, will soon incorporate the new system into its products. The o1 model also has a 'mini' version, called OpenAI o1-mini, designed to offer a more efficient solution for developers, 'a faster and more economical reasoning model that is particularly effective in coding', according to the company.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 13, 2024 04:52 PM\nSource:[EL UNIVERSO](https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/internacional/openai-presenta-o1-un-modelo-de-inteligencia-artificial-mas-moderno-que-chatgpt-y-con-capacidad-para-razonar-sus-respuestas-nota/)\n\n**OpenAI's Strawberry Model: A New Era of Reasoning and Calculation**\nOpenAI has released its highly anticipated model o1, also known as Strawberry, which is the company's first model capable of reasoning. The main feature of the new models is their ability to solve more complex tasks in the fields of science and programming, but they require more time to respond. According to the developers, 'we aim for future versions to think for hours, days, and even weeks.' The logic behind this is that the longer the model thinks, the more accurate the response will be. The o1 model currently takes a few seconds to think, and the first 'preview' model has already been integrated into the ChatGPT chatbot and API. An optimized version of the model, o1-mini, has also been released, which is specifically designed for programming. The new models are currently available to users of the paid ChatGPT Plus and Team packages, but o1-mini is planned to be included in the free version of the chatbot. In a week, users can send up to 30 messages to the older version of o1-preview and 50 messages to the smaller o1-mini. The new model is not a replacement for gpt-4 in all tasks, but rather a tool for tasks that require calculation or coding, such as solving math and programming problems at the level of international gold medalists. In complex physics tests, it is comparable to a PhD-level student, but it cannot search the internet without a connection. The preview version may have bugs, but the full model is already available and is being tested, with a later release planned.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 13, 2024 02:27 PM\nSource:[Хабр](https://habr.com/ru/news/843180/)\n\n**New ChatGPT Variant o1 Aims to Tackle Complex Questions**\nOpenAI has released an improved version of its ChatGPT chatbot, called o1.

The model is a collection of models, with two of them already available in ChatGPT and through the OpenAI API: o1-preview and o1 mini (a more compact and affordable model). To access, users must be subscribed to ChatGPT Plus or Team. Enterprise and Edu users will gain access next week. The chatbot o1 has limited capabilities, cannot browse web pages or analyze files, and has weekly limits of 30 messages for o1-preview and 50 for o1-mini. The models o1 are expensive, with o1-preview costing $15 for 1 million input tokens (3 times more expensive than GPT-4) and $60 for 1 million output tokens (4 times more expensive than GPT-4). OpenAI plans to make o1-mini available to all ChatGPT users, but has not set a release date. According to OpenAI, o1 avoids some pitfalls in reasoning that typically stump generative AI models. It can effectively fact-check and spend more time considering all parts of a question or team. OpenAI says o1, which emerged from an internal project called Q, excels at math and programming tasks. What sets o1 apart from other generative models is its ability to 'think' before responding to queries. When given extra time to think, o1 can consider a task holistically, plan it ahead, and perform a series of actions over a long period, helping it arrive at an answer. 'O1 is trained with reinforcement learning, which teaches the system to think before responding, using a private thought chain,' said Noam Brown, OpenAI researcher. On a math Olympiad exam for high school students, o1 correctly solved 83% of the problems, while GPT-4 solved only 13%. Overall, OpenAI claims o1 should perform better on data analysis, science, and coding tasks. However, o1 may work slower than other models, depending on the query, and may take over 10 seconds to respond to some questions. The o1 chatbot version shows its progress by displaying a label for the current subtask it is performing.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 12, 2024 06:08 PM\nSource:[Хабр](https://habr.com/ru/companies/bothub/news/842930/)\n\n**OpenAI Releases New AI Model That Answers More Complex Questions**\nOpenAI has released a new AI model, o1, which can perform human-like reasoning tasks and solve multi-step problems, including complicated math and coding questions.

They have already eliminated San Lorenzo and Fluminense, the last Copa Libertadores champion, in the previous rounds. River Plate, on the other hand, has been the top team in the group stage, with 16 points from five wins and one draw. They have also eliminated Talleres and Colo Colo in the previous rounds. The match is a must-win for River Plate, as they are the favorites to win the title and are under pressure to perform well in their home stadium. According to coach Marcelo Gallardo, the team is ready, with Marcos Acuña and Fabricio Bustos recovered from injuries and available for selection.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 02:00 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/deportes/futbol/en-que-canal-pasan-atletico-mineiro-vs-river-por-la-copa-libertadores-2024-hoy-nid22102024/)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The partnership will make Lyft's scaled rideshare platform available to all vehicles with Mobileye's self-driving technology. May Mobility will directly deploy autonomous vehicles to the Lyft platform in Atlanta starting in 2025. 'Lyft's aim is to connect AVs, drivers, riders, and partners to create new opportunities for all,' said David Risher, CEO of Lyft. This move comes as Tesla gears up to enter the autonomous ride-hailing market, with plans to start an autonomous ride-hail service in Texas and California next year. However, Tesla's vehicles may not all operate as driverless robotaxis initially, as some states demand a safety driver until certain milestones are reached. Meanwhile, Uber has a partnership with Alphabet's Waymo since 2023, and plans to bring fully autonomous vehicles to Austin and Atlanta in 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 08:19 AM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/11/41798436/lyft-teams-up-with-intels-mobileye-may-mobility-for-robotaxi-services-as-tesla-gears-up-to-enter-aut)\n\n**Why Self-Driving Taxis Won't Replace Ride-Hailing Services Just Yet**\nA study by Forbes compared 50 trips in Los Angeles made by Waymo, a self-driving taxi service, and traditional ride-hailing services (Uber and Lyft). The results showed that Waymo was 9.50 $ more expensive on average per trip, and the estimated waiting time before pickup was more than twice as long. While leaving a tip can reduce the difference, the estimated arrival time for Waymo trips was 121% longer than for traditional ride-hailing services. The study concluded that self-driving taxis are not yet a viable option, as they are more expensive and take longer to arrive. As one example, a trip from Santa Monica to downtown Los Angeles took 29 minutes with a traditional ride-hailing service, but 1 hour and 18 minutes with Waymo.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 06:03 AM\nSource:[01net](https://www.01net.com/?p=1235237)\n\n**Self-Driving Taxis Fall Short of Expectations in Terms of Service and Speed**\nA recent study by Forbes has revealed that self-driving taxis are not living up to expectations in terms of service and speed. According to the report, Waymo's robotaxis are not only more expensive, but also significantly longer. The study compared Waymo with traditional ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, and found that the average cost of a Waymo ride was $9.50 more than an Uber ride, and the average time was 7.2 minutes compared to 3.4 minutes for other services. As Forbes notes, 'the current offer of autonomous taxis does not align with the initial promises of transportation companies.' The study highlights the challenges faced by autonomous vehicles, including the need for extensive mapping and the adoption of a cautious driving style, which can be perceived as either positive or negative depending on the priority given to safety or speed.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 03:15 PM\nSource:[netcost-security.fr](https://www.netcost-security.fr/science/234736/une-etude-revele-que-les-waymos-autonomes-coutent-plus-cher-que-les-taxis-et-mettent-deux-fois-plus-de-temps-a-atteindre-leur-destination/)\n\n**Bolt Officially Available In Malaysia; Offers Up To 50% Off For Rides**\nBolt's e-hailing service is now officially available in Malaysia, starting November 6, 2024.
