**Expect more cheap Tesla vehicles from Hertz as the selloff continues**
Hertz plans to continue selling Tesla vehicles and other EVs in large quantities through 2025 as it struggles with massive depreciation. The company aims to sell 30,000 EVs this year and has already started selling Tesla Model 3s for under $25,000. Hertz's depreciation has increased by 89% to $537 per vehicle per month, and the company is on pace to finish its fleet changeover effort by the end of 2025. As the selloff continues, it is expected to put pressure on prices into next year and before the surge of used EVs from lease returns in 2026.

**The Tesla Model 3 will be the cheapest new Tesla car buyers can get for a while**
Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has dismissed the possibility of a non-autonomous EV to come in below the starting price of the Model 3, making the facelifted Model 3 the cheapest way to get into a new Tesla for quite some time. Musk stated, 'Basically, I think having a regular $25K model is pointless. It would be silly.' The news follows the debut of the Robotaxi, a self-driving two-seater with space for cargo, which will cost under $30,000. However, the Model 3 will remain the cheapest option for Tesla fans, starting at around $44,130, with a $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit bringing the price below $40,000 for a rear-wheel drive model.

**You Can Get A Brand New Tesla Cybertruck In A Week If You Order It Now, And That's Probably Bad For Tesla**
Tesla is now offering a new Cybertruck in as little as a week, with a $250 deposit required. This is good news for those who want a Cybertruck, but bad news for Tesla. Despite selling over 16,000 Cybertrucks in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2024, Tesla has cut prices by $20,000, suggesting a lack of demand. This could hurt resale values, as early reservation holders were able to flip their trucks for double the MSRP. As one analyst notes, 'Who knows, though? Tesla stans aren't bound by logic.'

**Here's How Much A Tesla Model 3 Depreciates After 3 Years**
A Tesla Model 3 loses an average of $15,228 of its value within three years, according to iSeeCars. The average resale value of a three-year-old Model 3 is $23,762, which is 60.9% of its brand-new price. This is due to Tesla's aggressive price cuts and the fact that EVs tend to depreciate faster than ICE cars. The Model 3's depreciation rate is 39.1% after three years, which is comparable to other electric compact cars in the premium segment. However, it is higher than the depreciation rate of ICE compact sedans and all sedans in general. The article also discusses the factors contributing to EV depreciation, including rapid technological advancements and the influence of Chinese EV makers on the global market.

**2024 Tesla Model 3**
The 2024 Tesla Model 3 has received an update, including new headlights and a revised front fascia. The base rear-wheel drive model can accelerate from 0-100 km/h in 6.1 seconds, while the AWD trim can do it in 4.4 seconds. The Model 3 has a range of 438-549 km on a full battery, depending on the trim. It has received top 'good' marks in standard safety tests, but has some concerns with reliability, including distracting controls and a stiff suspension. The interior is minimalist, with a central screen and dynamic steering wheel buttons. The dimensions are similar to a Honda Civic, with a length of 4,694 mm and a height of 1,443 mm. The Canadian pricing starts at $53,900 for the rear-wheel drive model, with an additional $10,000 for the Long Range suffix.

**Tesla has plans for cheaper electric car models**
Tesla reaffirmed its plan to make electric cars more affordable in a shareholder update, with new models expected to start production in the first half of 2025. The company aims to make electric vehicles (EVs) competitive with all forms of transportation in terms of total cost of ownership per mile. Currently, the cheapest Tesla model is the Model 3, which starts at £39,990. A new, more compact hatchback design is expected to be part of the affordable range, with prices expected to be around £23,000 or less. The Cybercab, a two-seater autonomous car, is planned for release by 2027 and is expected to cost $30,000 or less. The new models will compete with other affordable EVs such as the MG G4, Nissan Leaf, and Citroën e-C3. However, Tesla is currently facing a lawsuit from Alcon Entertainment over copyright infringement related to the Cybercab launch.

**Tesla says it's on track to produce "more affordable" vehicles in 2025**
Tesla has reiterated its plans to produce more affordable vehicles in 2025, with preparations underway for new models that will launch in the first half of next year. The company's current cheapest vehicle is the Long Range rear-wheel drive Model 3, priced at $42,490 before subsidies. Tesla had previously announced plans for a $25,000 EV, codenamed NV9, but these plans were reportedly abandoned earlier this year. However, Elon Musk has recommitted to producing more affordable vehicles, and the company will utilize aspects of its next-generation platform and current manufacturing lines to achieve cost reductions. While the new EV will be cheaper, it is unlikely to have a price tag as low as $25,000, as Tesla wrote, 'This approach [to manufacturing] will result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected but enables us to prudently grow our vehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain times.'

**Tesla Removes Its Cheapest Car from the Market**
Tesla has removed its cheapest car, the Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, from the market with a retail price of $42,500. The company announced in January that it had updated the Model 3 series in the US. Tesla also released its third-quarter delivery numbers, which included 462,890 vehicles delivered between July and September. Sales were supported by price discounts and other incentives, resulting in a 6.4% increase over last year's deliveries. However, this number fell short of analysts' predictions of over 469,000 deliveries for the quarter. This result may also hinder CEO Elon Musk's predictions of delivering over 1.8 million vehicles in 2023. Tesla is also facing challenges with vehicle recalls this year. While many of these issues have been resolved with wireless updates, the scope and number of problems may raise concerns among customers. The recalls affected 200,000 vehicles in January, 2 million in February, 125,000 in May, 12,000 in June, 1.8 million in July, and 9,000 in August. The impact of the cheapest model being removed from the market is unclear, but the company is committed to this decision. More details may be available soon, but for now, this is what is known.

**Tesla Stops Selling Cheapest Model 3, Struggles with Recall Issues**
Tesla has stopped selling its cheapest car model, the Model 3 Standard Range Rear-Wheel Drive, as it is no longer available on the company's online configurator. The car was priced at $39,000, but the updated Model 3 with the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive option now starts at $42,500. Tesla reported 462,890 vehicle deliveries between July and September, a 6.4% increase from the same period last year, but lower than analysts' expectations of over 469,000 deliveries. This may also impact CEO Elon Musk's prediction that the company will deliver 1.8 million vehicles in 2023. Additionally, Tesla is struggling with recall issues this year, with most problems fixed through software updates, but the scope and number of issues may leave customers uncertain. The recalls have affected 200,000 vehicles in January, 2 million in February, 125,000 in May, 12,000 in June, 1.8 million in July, and over 9,000 in August.

**Tesla Discounts Model Y and Model 3 Inventory, Prices Drop Below $35,000**
Tesla is offering discounts on its Model Y and Model 3 inventory, bringing the prices below $35,000 with federal tax credit applied. The Model Y starts at $34,790 for a 2024 long-range rear-wheel drive unit, while the Model 3 starts at $32,870 for a basic long-range rear-wheel drive unit in Stealth Grey color with black interior. With a $3,999 down payment, the monthly payment for the cheapest Model Y would be $646. However, the interest rate for financing has increased to 5.29% for a 72-month period, and 6.29% for an 84-month period. Despite this, customers can now buy a Model Y for under $35,000 with cash, as long as they don't mind the Stealth Grey color and basic black interior.

**Tesla Discontinues Cheapest Model in US, Price Increase Due to Tariffs**
Tesla has discontinued its Model 3 RWD Standard Range in the US, which had a price of $39,000, making its cheapest electric car in the US start at $42,490, approximately $818,625 pesos. This is due to the recent increase in tariffs on Chinese LFP batteries used in the vehicle, according to Electrek. The company, led by Elon Musk, often makes such moves without warning. In August 2024, it removed the Tesla Cybertruck RWD from its catalog, which cost $60,990, approximately $1,175,746 pesos. In Mexico, the situation is different, but more positive. Tesla recently lowered the price of the Model 3 RWD Standard Range by 50,000 pesos, making it available for 749,000 pesos. However, it is not the cheapest electric car in Mexico in 2024, as the SEV E-Wan Cross holds that title with a price of 346,900 pesos and a range of up to 230 kilometers on a single charge.

**Automaker quietly scraps cheapest model from US fleet in ‘strategic move’ that will cost customers thousands**
Tesla has quietly removed its cheapest model, the Model 3 Standard Range Rear-Wheel Drive, from its US website. The move is seen as a 'smart strategic move' by analyst Dan Ives, who believes it is a response to the US-China Cold Tech War and the tariffs imposed on Chinese EVs. The Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive is now the most affordable offering in the US, priced at $42,490. This decision comes after Tesla reported a smaller-than-expected rise in third-quarter deliveries, indicating that incentives and financing deals have not been effective in attracting customers. Additionally, the company has recalled 27,000 vehicles due to a software issue that can lead to serious injury and crashes, and has released a free software upgrade to resolve the issue.

**Tesla just killed its cheapest car**
Tesla has removed its cheapest model, the Model 3 Standard Range Rear-Wheel Drive, from its website, citing the impending Chinese tariffs on electric vehicles and components. The car, priced at $38,990, did not qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit due to its Chinese-made lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells. Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, has previously opposed the tariffs, but the company has now taken the model off the market. This move highlights the potential impact of the tariffs on the US auto industry, which may lead to higher prices and reduced availability of new cars. As Tesla's most affordable model, the Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, is now priced at $42,490, making it less accessible to budget-conscious buyers.

**Tesla Discontinues Cheapest Model Amidst Tariff Uncertainty**
Tesla has discontinued its cheapest model, the standard range Model 3 rear-wheel drive, which was priced at $38,990 and offered up to 272 miles of autonomy. The move comes as the US has announced higher tariffs on Chinese imports, including a 100% tariff on electric vehicles and 25% on electric vehicle batteries and essential minerals. The Model 3 rear-wheel drive long range is now Tesla's most affordable option in the US, priced at $42,490. Elon Musk has been vocal about opposing these tariffs, saying 'I wonder why?' However, the discontinuation of the affordable Model 3 shows the significant impact that tariffs could have on the American automotive industry, with many companies relying on cheaper Chinese components to adapt to their vehicles. Experts have warned that the impending tariffs could make buying new cars in the US more difficult and expensive.

**Tesla's Cheapest Model 3 Is The First Victim Of Chinese Tariffs**
Tesla has removed its cheapest Model 3 from its website due to impending Chinese tariffs. The Model 3 Standard Range Rear-Wheel Drive, priced at $38,990, used lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells sourced from China, making it ineligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit. The tariffs, which include a 100% tariff on EVs and 25% on EV batteries and key minerals, are expected to make buying new cars in the U.S. harder and more expensive. Meanwhile, Toyota has delayed its plans for U.S.-made EVs until 2026, citing a tempering of expectations for its electric ambitions. BYD, a Chinese automaker, has seen a shift in its sales, with hybrid models now accounting for more than half of its sales, surpassing electric vehicles. Exports of China-made hybrids have roughly doubled every year since 2020, and BYD is increasing its global footprint with its budget EV offerings. 'It's far too early to ring the alarm bells, but making sure the supply chains are adequately provided for is definitely on everybody's radar at the moment,' said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.

**Tesla Removes Cheapest Electric Car from Sale**
Tesla has removed its cheapest electric car, the Model 3 Standard Range, from sale. The car was priced at $39,000, making it the most affordable Tesla model. According to Electrek, the removal of the car is likely due to the recent increase in tariffs on Chinese batteries in the US, which would have allowed Tesla to save on production costs. As a result, the most affordable Tesla model is now the Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel-Drive, priced at $42,500. This means that users who are looking for the most affordable Tesla will have to pay an additional $3,500. However, they can still take advantage of the $7,500 tax credit for buying an electric vehicle in the US.

**Tesla Removes Cheapest Model 3 Version, Recalls Millions of Vehicles**
Tesla has removed the cheapest version of its electric car, the Model 3 Standard Range, from its online configurator, which cost $39,000. According to Engadget, a new version of the Model 3 with a rear-wheel drive and a longer range will be available, priced at $42,500. This updated version of the Model 3 was introduced in the US in January. Tesla also released its third-quarter sales results, delivering 462,890 vehicles, a 6.4% increase from the previous year, but short of analysts' expectations of over 469,000 deliveries. This result may cast doubt on Elon Musk's ambitious forecast of surpassing 1.8 million vehicles in 2023. Tesla has recalled millions of vehicles, with most issues resolved through over-the-air updates, but the scope and frequency of these recalls may cause concern among customers. In June 2024, Tesla recalled 125,227 vehicles in the US due to a faulty seatbelt warning system, which may increase the risk of injury in a collision. In February 2023, Tesla recalled approximately 362,000 electric cars due to a software issue with its full self-driving system, which could cause an accident. In May 2023, Tesla recalled 1,104,622 vehicles in China, including imported Model S and Model X, as well as locally produced Model Y and Model 3, manufactured between January 12, 2019, and April 24, 2023.

**Tesla just stopped selling the cheapest version of the Model 3 in the US. An analyst called it 'a smart strategic move.'**
Tesla has discontinued its cheapest version of the Model 3 sedan in the US, priced at $38,990, and replaced it with the Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, priced at $42,490. According to Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, this move is 'a smart strategic move' that signals a greater focus on the Long Range Model 3. Ives believes that the tariffs on Chinese EVs, which are no longer eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit, have benefited Tesla. The company's decision to discontinue the cheapest Model 3 comes as it slightly beat analysts' delivery expectations, with third-quarter sales rising to 462,890 vehicles. Ives said that Tesla's sales were 'a step in the right direction' to meet its yearly target of 1.8 million vehicle deliveries. The price war in the EV market is intensifying, with Chinese competitors like Xpeng launching affordable models and Nio and BYD planning to launch new brands that will directly compete with Tesla's Model Y.

Tesla has been struggling to retain its market position, with year-over-year sales drops, and has made several price adjustments in the past few years.

Tesla has discontinued its cheapest electric car model, the Model 3 Standard Range Rear-Wheel-Drive, priced at $39,000. The Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel-Drive, priced at $42,500, is now the most affordable option. Tesla likely made this change due to increased tariffs on Chinese battery cells, which also affect the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles. As a result, buyers looking for the cheapest Tesla vehicle will have to opt for the Model 3 Long Range RWD, which has 90 miles more range for $3,500 more. However, if eligible for the federal tax credit, the vehicle can be purchased for $35,000 before state incentives and gas savings.
