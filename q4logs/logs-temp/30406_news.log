**Andrea Bocelli to Give Concert at Estádio Municipal de Leiria in 2025**
Andrea Bocelli will give a concert at the Estádio Municipal de Leiria in 2025, featuring an 80-piece orchestra and a 70-voice choir. The concert, which will take place on May 31, 2025, will be a unique and memorable experience, according to Tiago Castelo Branco, executive director of MOT - Espetáculos e Entretenimento Lda. 'The artist doesn't need big presentations. It will be a show that will surprise everyone,' he said. The tickets for the two-hour show will go on sale on October 11, 2024, exclusively on the event's official website, with prices ranging from 60 to 190 euros. The stadium has a total capacity of 25,000 seats, with 10,000 on the grass. The organization believes that the concert will attract fans from all over the world, as it did in Coimbra, where people from 50 countries bought tickets for the show. 'It's a unique experience, both sensorial and spiritual, of a person with an unmistakable voice,' said Gonçalo Lopes, president of the Câmara de Leiria.
