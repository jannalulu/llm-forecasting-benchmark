**Reddit Tumbles 7% In Premarket Amid Advance's Stake Sale Announcement: Technicals Show Strong Support, But Selling Pressure Persists At Overbought Levels - Reddit (NYSE:RDDT)**
Reddit's stock (NYSE:RDDT) plummeted 6.2% to $148.11 per share in premarket trading, despite closing 16% higher at $158.02 on Thursday. The decline comes after Advance Magazine Publishers Inc. announced plans to sell up to $1.2 billion of its stake in the company. Technical analysis suggests strong support for the stock, but overbought conditions may lead to selling pressure. According to Benzinga pro data, Reddit has a consensus price target of $92.84, with a high of $150 per share and a low of $54 apiece. Analysts at Piper Sandler, Bernstein, and Citigroup have an average price target of $118.33, implying a 19.28% downside for Reddit.

**Rivian to Introduce Google Cast and Voice Control Systems**
Rivian is preparing for a technological breakthrough: owners of electric vehicles will receive Google Cast support with the software update version 2024.47 next month, making Rivian the first Android Automotive-based automaker to implement this feature. According to Vassim Bensaïd, head of the software department, this was confirmed at the Los Angeles auto show. In addition to Google Cast, Rivian is actively developing voice control systems. By 2025, the company plans to introduce an AI platform that will allow users to interact with the vehicle through voice commands, the screen, or an app. The new system will also be able to convert text to speech, making it easier to read and respond to messages. As noted by PEPELAC.NEWS, Rivian is also focused on developing charging infrastructure. In early 2025, the Energy App 2.0 is expected to be launched, providing users with information on energy consumption and optimal charging methods. These steps highlight Rivian's efforts to strengthen its position in the electric vehicle market by implementing advanced technologies and improving the user experience.

**Rivian Electric Vehicle Lineup For 2025, Upcoming R2 and R3X To Be Showcased Across The Country**
Rivian has announced a North American tour to showcase its upcoming electric vehicles (EVs), including the R2 and R3X models. The tour will feature the R2 at various locations across the U.S. and Canada, with the R3X making guest appearances. The event series is tied to automotive shows, with the exception of the LA Auto Show. Rivian has already received over 100,000 pre-orders for the R2 since its reveal in March, and the company is expanding its Normal, Illinois factory to prepare for production. The R2 has already been showcased in several locations, including California cities, Vancouver, and New York City.

**Is Rivian's Biggest Catalyst in Danger?**
Rivian's potential for positive gross profit in the fourth quarter is in danger due to a third-quarter production snag caused by a shortage of a shared component. The production disruption led to a slump in deliveries and a wider-than-expected adjusted EBITDA loss of $760 million. Despite this, management reaffirmed its forecast of 47,000 to 49,000 production units and deliveries between 50,500 and 52,000. However, management revised its 2024 EBITDA loss to a range between $2.825 billion and $2.875 billion. Two reasons to believe Rivian can still achieve gross profit margins in the fourth quarter are improvements in variable costs and regulatory credits, which will boost results by $275 million in Q4 alone. Investors should temper their expectations, as progress may not be in a straight line, and 2025 may be a mix of quarterly gross profits and losses.

**Rivian reassures investors with cost cuts, green credit sales amid weak EV demand**
Rivian has reassured investors with cost cuts and a sharp increase in green car credit sales, despite a parts shortage disrupting production and weak EV demand. The company expects to turn a gross profit in the fourth quarter and report an annual gross profit in 2025. Sales of regulatory credits are expected to reach $300 million this year and the next, up from $73 million in 2023. Rivian has been slashing costs by renegotiating supplier contracts and revamping its manufacturing processes. The company also announced a five-year supply deal for batteries with LG Energy Solution's Arizona subsidiary for its smaller, cheaper R2 SUV. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said, 'We're closely analyzing a variety of outcomes that could play out with the change in administration.' Shares in Rivian were up nearly 2% after hours.

Rivian (RIVN) is set to report its third-quarter earnings on Thursday after market close. Despite a supply shortage that impacted production, Rivian expects to deliver slightly more vehicles in 2024 than last year.

**Is Rivian Stock a Buy Before Nov. 7? | The Motley Fool**
Rivian Automotive's stock has dropped by 57% this year, but the company has set itself up for a turnaround. Its upcoming quarterly report on Nov. 7 could provide investors with reasons to think the direction from here is up. Rivian management can focus on three things: having enough capital to get through the production and ramp-up stages for its next-generation R2 SUV, 2025 production expectations, and ongoing cost reductions. If Rivian confidently states it has enough capital to get to 2027 while still investing for future growth, it will likely boost the stock. A boost in production plans and discussion about ongoing cost reductions will also play a role in how investors react. As The Motley Fool notes, 'the Nov. 7 report from Rivian could be a turning point for the company and the stock.'

**Should You Buy Rivian Stock Before Nov. 7? | The Motley Fool**
Rivian Automotive, an electric vehicle start-up, will release its third-quarter earnings results on Nov. 7. The company's stock has declined 94% from its all-time highs due to production stalls and significant cash burn. Rivian's management has announced a partnership with Volkswagen, which will invest $5 billion in the company. However, the company's unit economics are 'terrible', and it is burning $5 billion in free cash flow annually. Analysts predict that Rivian will run out of money within two to three years, even with the infusion from Volkswagen. As a result, it is recommended to keep Rivian stock away from portfolios unless the management team performs a miracle and achieves positive cash flow.

**Tempted to Give Up on Rivian? Here's Why It's Way Too Early for That | The Motley Fool**
Rivian's recent production snag and delivery slowdown have led some investors to consider giving up on the young EV maker. However, it's too early to do so, as the company has several projects and programs that are just getting started and will help move the needle for its top and bottom line. These include its pre-owned sales program, expansion of its RCV line, joint venture deal with Volkswagen, and product pipeline, which includes the highly anticipated R2 crossover. The R2 is scheduled to launch in the first half of 2026 with a starting price below $50,000, and will combine to dramatically expand the company's market reach, improve scale, and narrow its financial losses. As the company's strategies and programs are still in the early stages, investors will have to be patient and willing to accept the swings in stock price, which will continue to be high risk and speculative for the foreseeable future.

**A Little Good News for Rivian Investors | The Motley Fool**
Rivian Automotive has launched a pre-owned vehicle sales program for its R1T and R1S models, which could be a significant revenue stream for the company. This move follows in the footsteps of Tesla, which started a pre-owned program in 2015. According to Edmunds senior analyst Ivan Drury, 'It's almost mandatory if you want to be taken seriously... For consumers testing the waters on brands they've never had experience with, you want as many things as possible that inspire confidence, and these programs speak to that.' The demand for used EVs is up 32% year over year, and Rivian's pre-owned program could help boost profits by allowing retailers to price vehicles above market value. While the program is still in its early stages, it gives Rivian another lever to pull in 2025 as investors look for consistent gross profits.

**Rivian: I Was Early And Wrong (Rating Downgrade)**
The author initially rated Rivian as 'Sell' in 2021 and upgraded to 'Buy' in July 2024, but now admits to being 'early and wrong'. The company's Q2 2024 results showed significant gross profit losses and production disruptions, leading to lowered future earnings estimates. Despite a strong cash position from the VW deal, Rivian's continuous cash burn and deferred break-even projections raise concerns. The author downgrades their rating to 'Hold' due to the company's growth and profitability challenges, as well as increasing EV competition. While a technical bounce is possible, the author cannot maintain a bullish stance when fundamentals do not support it.

**'Rift with Rohit Sharma? Leaving ...?': Rishabh Pant's cryptic 'just be quiet' post sparks internet furore**
India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant sparked a social media furore after posting a cryptic story on Instagram, saying 'Sometimes it's best to just be quiet and let God show people.' The post came after India's loss to New Zealand in the opening Test, with some fans speculating that it was a dig at India captain Rohit Sharma, while others thought it was aimed at Delhi Capitals, who may not retain him for the 2025 IPL season. A report suggests that Pant could be rested for the second Test against New Zealand, which would be a wise decision given India's upcoming Border-Gavaskar series in Australia.

**Rivian Delays Mass Production of R2 and R3 Models Until 2028**
Rivian, the US-based electric vehicle manufacturer, has announced that the mass production of its R2 and R3 models will be delayed until 2028. The company had initially planned to start production in the near future, but due to the ongoing construction of a new factory in Georgia, the production will be postponed. The new factory, which is expected to have a production capacity of 400,000 vehicles per year, is currently under construction and is expected to be operational by the end of 2028. Rivian has received over 100,000 pre-orders for the R2 model, which was presented in March 2024. The company will initially produce a limited number of units at its existing factory, but mass production will only begin once the new factory is operational.

**The Rivian R2 And R3 Won’t Be Built In Georgia Until At Least 2028**
Rivian has applied for a loan with the U.S. Department of Energy to restart construction on its Georgia mega plant, where the R2 and R3 SUVs will be assembled.

The company has revised its production and delivery targets for 2024, expecting to manufacture between 47,000 and 49,000 vehicles and deliver between 50,500 and 52,000 EVs, which is lower than last year's figures. Rivian received over 100,000 preorders for the $45,000 R2 SUV when it was unveiled in March, but it won't hit the streets until 2026 in limited numbers, initially manufactured at the Normal, Illinois plant.

Rivian has applied for a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) loan to fund construction of its Georgia factory, aiming to start partial operations in the third quarter of 2027. The factory, located east of Atlanta, will become Rivian's second production site, alongside its current Normal, Illinois, plant. Rivian has paused construction on the Georgia factory to focus on increasing production capacity at the Illinois plant, which will produce 215,000 vehicles annually, including the R2 electric SUV. The company expects to save $2.25 billion and speed up production by moving the R2 to Illinois, and may shift the R3 and R3X models to the Georgia plant if it receives the DOE loan and completes construction.

**Rivian (RIVN) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030**
Rivian Automotive's stock price has plummeted 86.60% since its IPO, currently trading at $10.45 per share. Despite this, the company is expected to show significant growth in the next few years, with a projected revenue of $37 billion in 2029 and $140.00 per share in 2030. Key drivers of this growth include cost reduction in EV components, increased production capacity, and the introduction of the Gen 2 platform, which is expected to reduce material costs by 45% by 2026. Rivian aims to target profitability by 2027 and has a long-term goal of 25% gross margin, high teens adjusted EBITDA margin, and 10% FCF margin. However, the company still faces significant challenges, including high debt and expenses, and will need to demonstrate its ability to lower costs and achieve positive net income in order to regain investor confidence.

**Rivian Introduces Driver Comfort Assist: A New Approach to Autonomous Driving**
Rivian has announced a new driver assistance system called Driver Comfort Assist, which will adjust speed and lane position based on road conditions and surrounding vehicles. The system will be available in 2025, after the release of Enhanced Highway Assist. Rivian's new Autonomy Platform+ replaces the previous Driver+ system, offering enhanced driver assistance features. Initially, these features will be provided for free, but from 2025, they will become paid through a subscription. Driver Comfort Assist stands out by not only assisting the driver but also regulating speed and position on the road. This approach to autonomy is similar to Tesla's, but Rivian focuses on gradual development without ambitions to create fully autonomous taxis. Instead, the company collects anonymous data to train its systems, aiming to improve functionality and driving quality.
