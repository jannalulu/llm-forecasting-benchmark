**US oil drilling costs may reach $67-$70 per barrel by 2026 under Trump**
A report by Ventura Securities suggests that US oil drilling costs may reach $67-$70 per barrel by 2026 under a Trump presidency. The report notes that increased US oil production through aggressive drilling policies could lead to shifts in global supply dynamics, influenced by factors such as Middle East tensions, sanctions on countries like Iran, and trade tensions. The report also mentions that trade uncertainty and frictions remain a headwind to crude prices, and that a resurgence of sanctions on Iran could lead to a potential loss of supply from the oil market. Currently, market prices stand at $70 for WTI Crude, $74 for Brent, and Rs 6,024 for MCX November Futures. The report suggests that the Trump regime may bring comfort to the oil industry by investing in pipeline infrastructure, thereby increasing crude oil output.

**US Oil Drilling Rigs Remain Unchanged**
According to Baker Hughes' weekly data, the number of oil drilling rigs in the US remained unchanged at 479 from November 2-8. This is a decrease of 15 rigs compared to the same period last year. The Brent crude oil price closed at $72.36 per barrel on Thursday and $70.38 per barrel on Friday. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price closed at $73.87 per barrel on Friday, after closing at $75.63 per barrel on Thursday. 'The number of oil drilling rigs in the US has remained stable, but the decrease in the number of rigs over the past year is a concern,' said no one in the article. However, the article does not quote anyone directly. The article does mention that the decrease in the number of rigs over the past year is a concern, but it does not attribute this statement to anyone.

**US Oil and Gas Rig Count Holds Steady for Record Third Week – Baker Hughes**
The US oil and gas rig count has remained steady for a record third week in a row, according to Baker Hughes' data. The total rig count was 585 in the week to November 8, with oil rigs holding at 479 and gas rigs at 102. This is 31 rigs, or 5%, below the count at this time last year. The decline in rig count is attributed to a decrease in oil and gas prices, higher labor and equipment costs, and companies focusing on debt repayment and shareholder returns. US oil futures are down 2% so far in 2024, while US gas futures are up 6%. US crude output is expected to rise to 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024 and 13.5 million bpd in 2025, while US gas output is expected to slide to 103.5 billion cubic feet per day in 2024, down from a record high of 103.8 bcfd in 2023.

**US Oil and Gas Drilling Rigs Remain Unchanged This Week**
The number of oil and gas drilling rigs in the United States remained unchanged this week, down two from October, according to Baker Hughes. The total number of rigs, an early indicator of future production, remained at 585 for the week of October 25. Baker Hughes reported that the total number of rigs is still down 40, or 6% less than the same time last year. The number of oil rigs decreased by two to 480 this week, while the number of gas rigs increased by two to 101. For the month, the total number of rigs for oil and gas decreased by two after increasing by four in September. The number of oil rigs decreased by four in October after increasing by one in September, while the number of gas rigs increased by two this month after increasing by four last month. The number of rigs for oil and gas fell by around 20% in 2023 after increasing by 33% in 2022 and 67% in 2021, due to the decline in oil and gas prices, the increase in labor and equipment costs due to inflation, and the fact that companies have focused on debt repayment and increasing shareholder returns rather than increasing production. Oil and gas futures contracts have remained stable so far in 2024 after falling 11% in 2023, while natural gas futures contracts have increased by around 1% so far in 2024 after falling 44% in 2023.

**U.S. Drillers Cut Oil and Gas Rigs for Fourth Time in Five Weeks – Baker Hughes**
U.S. energy firms cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs for the fourth time in five weeks, according to Baker Hughes. The oil and gas rig count fell by one to 585, with 482 oil rigs and 99 gas rigs. This is 39 rigs, or 6%, below the total rig count from this time last year. The decline in rigs is due to lower oil and gas prices, higher labor and equipment costs, and companies focusing on debt repayment and shareholder returns. U.S. oil futures are down 3% so far in 2024, while U.S. gas futures are 10% lower. Despite the decline in rigs, U.S. crude production hit a record high of 13.5 million barrels per day last week. The EIA forecasts U.S. crude output to rise to 13.2 million bpd in 2024 and 13.5 million bpd in 2025. On the gas side, the number of rigs has slumped by 18% this year, causing U.S. gas output to forecast a decline to 103.5 billion cubic feet per day in 2024.

**US Drillers Add Oil and Gas Rigs for First Time in Four Weeks, Baker Hughes Says**
According to Baker Hughes, US energy firms added oil and gas rigs for the first time in four weeks, with the total rig count rising by one to 586 in the week to Oct. 11. However, the total count is still down 36 rigs or 6% from this time last year. The oil rig count rose by two to 481, while the gas rig count fell by one to 101. In Pennsylvania, drillers cut two rigs, bringing the state's total down to 13, the lowest since July 2016. Higher oil prices are expected to prompt drillers to boost US crude output from a record 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023 to 13.2 million bpd in 2024 and 13.5 million bpd in 2025, according to the EIA. On the gas side, US gas output is expected to slide to 103.5 billion cubic feet per day in 2024, down from a record high of 103.8 bcfd in 2023.

**US drillers cut oil and gas rigs for third week in a row - Baker Hughes - ET Auto**
US drillers have cut the number of oil and gas rigs for the third week in a row, according to Baker Hughes. The oil and gas rig count fell by 2 to 585 in the week to October 4, with oil rigs dropping to 479, their lowest since July 19. Despite higher oil prices, drillers have reduced spending on drilling activities, leading to a decline in US crude output. The EIA predicts US crude output will reach 13.7 million barrels per day in 2025, down from a record 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023. On the gas side, US gas output is expected to slide to 103.4 billion cubic feet per day in 2024, down from a record high of 103.8 billion cubic feet per day in 2023. 'Those higher oil prices prompted drillers to boost U.S. crude output from a record 12.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2023 to 13.3 million bpd in 2024 and 13.7 million bpd in 2025,' according to the EIA outlook.

**Drilling Activity in Colombia Continues to Decline**
The drilling activity in Colombia continues to decline, according to the monthly report of drilling and production presented by the Colombian Chamber of Petroleum, Gas and Energy (Campetrol). In August 2024, there were 108 active drilling rigs in the country, a 10.7% decrease compared to the same period in 2023, when the number was 121. The president of Campetrol, Nelsón Castañeda, stated that 'we are used to the price cycles of oil and prepare ourselves to recover when it goes down and have an activity in line with the profitability of the business. With prices above $80, I have never seen a decline of almost 30% in the last 22 months.' The drilling activity in Colombia has contracted by 30.3% since November 2022, with 47 fewer drilling rigs in operation, both in perforation and reconditioning. The sector has warned that this trend has had a negative impact not only on operational issues, but also on employment generation, with an estimated loss of 24,700 jobs.
