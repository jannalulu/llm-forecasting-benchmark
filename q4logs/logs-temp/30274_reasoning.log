To forecast whether a bilateral ceasefire will be announced in the Ukraine war before January 1, 2025, let's consider available evidence, historical contexts, and potential conflicting forces.

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates**: Historically, conflicts like the one in Ukraine have been difficult to resolve in short timelines, particularly when involving significant external actors and unresolved territorial disputes. The presence of ongoing fighting and lack of substantial negotiations further complicates ceasefire announcements.

2. **Current Situation & Factors**:
   - **Political Dynamics**: The election of Donald Trump as U.S. President may influence future negotiations. His promise to end the conflict within 24 hours suggests urgency and potential for radical diplomatic maneuvers, though substantial skepticism exists around this timeline.
   - **Military Movements**: Current reports suggest intensifying military actions, including Ukraine receiving more capable weaponry, which might either deter negotiations or push towards a settlement if one side gains a significant upper hand.
   - **Statements from Leaders**: Ukrainian leaders, including President Zelensky, have expressed skepticism about ceasefires without acceptable security guarantees and strategic conditions.
   - **Diplomatic Efforts**: Prospective meetings involving Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S. might lead to some dialogue, but concrete outcomes are uncertain given entrenched positions.

3. **Conflicting Forces**:
   - **In Favor of Ceasefire**: Significant international pressure, potential U.S. diplomatic initiatives post-Trump's inauguration, and exhaustion from continued losses contribute to a possible ceasefire.
   - **Against Ceasefire**: The hard-line stances from both Ukraine and Russia, doubts about credible guarantees, and recent escalations in fighting argue against a ceasefire being imminent.

4. **Adjustments & Evidence Weighing**:
   - **News & Developments**: Recent articles have not suggested an immediate or concrete move towards a full bilateral ceasefire before the end of 2024. Activities and rhetoric suggest a more prolonged conflict.
   - **Historical Analogies**: Comparisons with other historical conflicts suggest that achieving a ceasefire with such complex and numerous actors typically takes significant time.

Given these considerations, the probability of a bilateral ceasefire being announced before January 1, 2025, remains relatively low. Balancing recent political changes, skeptical leadership communications, and historical challenges in similar situations, I propose:

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Consideration:
- We're forecasting until January 1, 2025 (about 40 days from today)
- Trump won't take office until January 20, 2025, which is after our forecast period
- Most sources suggest major peace initiatives would wait until Trump's inauguration

2. Key Evidence Supporting Higher Probability:
- Multiple reports of Trump's team preparing peace plans
- Poland's PM Tusk expressed confidence in near-future ceasefire
- Turkey may host peace talks before January 2025
- Josep Borrell's suggestion of upcoming ceasefire proposal
- International pressure mounting for resolution

3. Key Evidence Supporting Lower Probability:
- Zelensky explicitly ruled out ceasefire talks without security guarantees
- Recent Ukrainian permission to use missiles against Russian targets suggests escalation
- Ukrainian Foreign Minister's aggressive stance on targeting Russia
- Expert Alexander Musiyenko predicts negotiations unlikely before fall 2025
- Russia's conditions (territorial concessions) remain unacceptable to Ukraine

4. Critical Factors:
- The 40-day window is very short
- Most peace initiatives are tied to Trump's presidency, which starts after our timeframe
- Current military dynamics show escalation rather than de-escalation
- Neither side appears ready for major concessions
- Recent statements from both sides indicate hardening positions

5. Key Uncertainties:
- Potential secret negotiations
- Unexpected battlefield developments
- External pressure from allies
- Winter's impact on military operations

The very short timeframe combined with explicit statements from key players against immediate ceasefire talks, plus the timing of Trump's inauguration being after our forecast period, suggests a low probability. However, the multiple reports of ongoing peace initiatives and international pressure provide some possibility.

My Prediction: Between 5.20% and 15.80%, with 8.40% being the most likely. Probability: 8.40%.

To forecast whether a bilateral ceasefire will be announced in the Ukraine war before January 1, 2025, let's examine the current situation and potential influences.

1. **Base Rates and Historical Context**: Historically, ceasefires in protracted conflicts with deep geopolitical roots are rare and often hinge on substantial changes in the international political environment. The ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia has seen intermittent attempts at negotiation and ceasefires, but none have been comprehensive or lasting.

2. **Current Influences and News Reports**:
   - Ukrainian officials, including President Zelensky, have publicly ruled out ceasefire talks until at least the end of the war.
   - Trump's promises of a swift resolution are largely speculative and lack concrete diplomatic groundwork or details, according to analyzed sources.
   - Differences on key issues such as NATO membership and territorial integrity remain significant barriers to an agreement.
   - Reports suggest potential diplomatic moves in early 2025, coinciding with Trump's presidency, indicating a delay beyond the forecast period.

3. **Contradictory Forces**:
   - There are structural impediments to a quick ceasefire, such as ongoing military engagements and security concerns from Ukraine.
   - The anticipation of U.S. diplomatic engagement under Trump's administration could bring some negotiation efforts but likely not materialize in a formal announcement before 2025.

4. **Trends and Recent Developments**:
   - The allowance of using long-range missiles by Ukraine suggests ongoing military actions rather than de-escalation.
   - Discussions about ceasefire possibilities align more with post-inaugural timelines of U.S. policy changes, further indicating resolutions might come in early 2025 rather than before January 1.

5. **Probabilistic Weighing**:
   - The key evidence signals a low probability of a comprehensive ceasefire announcement by both sides before January 1, 2025. The geopolitical dynamics, military realities, and timelines around U.S. diplomatic interventions lead to a cautious assessment.

In conclusion, combining the historical context, current geopolitical landscapes, recent news insights, and diplomatic timelines, I assign a low probability to the event occurring within the stipulated timeframe.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

6. Ukraine's apparent shift in priorities toward security guarantees over territorial boundaries

Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
1. Trump doesn't take office until January 20, 2025, after the resolution date
2. Zelensky explicitly ruling out ceasefire talks without security guarantees
3. Ukrainian expert Musiyenko believing negotiations won't happen before fall 2025
4. Complex preconditions from both sides (NATO membership, territorial control)
5. Recent escalation with US allowing ATACMS use against Russian targets
6. Historical difficulty in achieving comprehensive ceasefires in this conflict

Breaking down sub-problems:
1. Likelihood of pre-inauguration diplomatic breakthrough: Low
2. Probability of both sides accepting terms before January: Moderate
3. Chance of external pressure forcing agreement: Moderate
4. Likelihood of military situation forcing negotiations: Low-Moderate

Timeline considerations:
- Only about 40 days remain until January 1, 2025
- Most sources suggest meaningful negotiations would start after Trump's inauguration
- Current military situation doesn't suggest immediate urgency for ceasefire

Balancing evidence:

To forecast whether a bilateral ceasefire will be announced in the Ukraine war before January 1, 2025, I will apply a structured approach:

Initial Assessment (Base Rate and Historical Context):
1. Historically, ceasefires in prolonged conflicts involving major powers are difficult to achieve quickly. The conditions for a ceasefire—mutual exhaustion, external pressure, or significant diplomatic engagement—may not be fully met here. The Ukraine conflict has similar complexities.

Recent Developments (Adjustments to Base Rate):
1. Donald Trump's recent election win and claims of resolving the conflict quickly could suggest potential changes in diplomatic dynamics. He proposes appointing a special envoy, which could accelerate negotiations.
2. Both Ukraine and Russia seem far from ready to sign a comprehensive ceasefire. Ukraine has been clear about not conceding territory, and Russia demands recognition of annexed territories.
3. Multiple sources predict that substantive negotiations might not happen until Fall 2025, well after the specified deadline of January 1, 2025.
4. Zelensky and Ukrainian officials have consistently emphasized the need for security guarantees and territorial integrity, indicating a reluctance for a ceasefire without substantial assurances, which are not yet in place.

Factors Reducing Likelihood (Causal Forces):
1. Continued military engagements and strategic positioning on both sides don't suggest an immediate appetite for a ceasefire.
2. Trump's inauguration coincides closely with the deadline and often, electoral promises take time to translate into action, especially with complex international conflicts.

Factors Increasing Likelihood:
1. There is some international momentum for peace, with external actors like Erdogan promising efforts for a ceasefire, potentially leading to new diplomatic avenues.
2. Trump's promise, despite skepticism, may pressure some stakeholders into expedited talks.

Recent News Impact (Including Trump Factor):
- Reports suggest Trump's plan may be delayed until post-inauguration, yet there is some political mobilization around Trump's peace anticipations and Turkey's potential mediation role.

Probability Ranges:
1. Given past patterns and current indicators, base expectations lean towards a low probability of a comprehensive ceasefire announcement before January 1, 2025.
2. Considering Trump's possibly impactful diplomacy, an upward adjustment is warranted, acknowledging the possibility of unexpected breakthroughs.

Combining these elements, including the complexity and potentially catalytic political changes with Trump's position, I refine the prediction probability.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

1. Donald Trump's recent election win and claims of resolving the conflict quickly could suggest potential changes in diplomatic dynamics. He proposes appointing a special envoy, which could accelerate negotiations.
2. Both Ukraine and Russia seem far from ready to sign a comprehensive ceasefire. Ukraine has been clear about not conceding territory, and Russia demands recognition of annexed territories.
3. Multiple sources predict that substantive negotiations might not happen until Fall 2025, well after the specified deadline of January 1, 2025.
4. Zelensky and Ukrainian officials have consistently emphasized the need for security guarantees and territorial integrity, indicating a reluctance for a ceasefire without substantial assurances, which are not yet in place.

Factors Reducing Likelihood (Causal Forces):
1. Continued military engagements and strategic positioning on both sides don't suggest an immediate appetite for a ceasefire.
2. Trump's inauguration coincides closely with the deadline and often, electoral promises take time to translate into action, especially with complex international conflicts.

Factors Increasing Likelihood:
1. There is some international momentum for peace, with external actors like Erdogan promising efforts for a ceasefire, potentially leading to new diplomatic avenues.
2. Trump's promise, despite skepticism, may pressure some stakeholders into expedited talks.

Recent News Impact (Including Trump Factor):
- Reports suggest Trump's plan may be delayed until post-inauguration, yet there is some political mobilization around Trump's peace anticipations and Turkey's potential mediation role.

Probability Ranges:
1. Given past patterns and current indicators, base expectations lean towards a low probability of a comprehensive ceasefire announcement before January 1, 2025.
2. Considering Trump's possibly impactful diplomacy, an upward adjustment is warranted, acknowledging the possibility of unexpected breakthroughs.

Combining these elements, including the complexity and potentially catalytic political changes with Trump's position, I refine the prediction probability.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Trump's election victory and consistent promises to end the war within 24 hours of taking office (January 20, 2025)
2. Multiple reports indicating Trump's team is actively preparing peace plans
3. Polish PM Tusk and EU's Borrell both expecting ceasefire proposals soon after Trump's inauguration
4. Turkey's potential role as mediator, with reports of possible peace talks before January 2025
5. Zelensky's recent statements suggesting war could end by 2025
6. Ukraine's increasing military challenges and Western aid fatigue

Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
1. Resolution criteria requires full bilateral ceasefire across ALL territories
2. Zelensky explicitly ruled out ceasefire without security guarantees
3. Ukraine still seeking NATO membership and security guarantees
4. Russia maintaining firm conditions (including Ukrainian withdrawal from occupied territories)
5. Time constraint - only about 40 days left in 2024
6. Recent escalation with US allowing longer-range missiles
7. Most expert predictions point to Fall 2025 for potential peace talks

Breaking down timing:
- Trump won't take office until January 20, 2025
- Any pre-inauguration ceasefire would need significant groundwork
- Most sources suggest peace initiatives will begin after Trump's inauguration

Analysis:
While there's increasing momentum toward peace talks, the strict resolution criteria requiring a full bilateral ceasefire across all territories makes this unlikely before 2025. The timing is particularly challenging given that most peace initiatives are tied to Trump's presidency, which begins after the resolution date. Current military escalation and opposing positions on key issues further reduce the likelihood of a comprehensive ceasefire in the next 40 days.

My Prediction: Between 5.20% and 15.80%, with 8.50% being the most likely. Probability: 8.50%.

To forecast whether a bilateral ceasefire will be announced in the Ukraine war before January 1, 2025, I need to analyze the situation carefully:

1. **Base Rates and Historical Reference**: Historically, wars involving major powers take considerable time to reach a ceasefire agreement, especially ones involving territorial disputes and military commitments from international allies. Absent strong diplomatic incentives or pressures, swift resolutions are uncommon.

2. **Current Political Dynamics**:
   - The recent U.S. election of Donald Trump introduces potential variability, with his repeated claims of ending the war quickly, possibly by leveraging his perceived ability to negotiate with key leaders like Zelensky and Putin.
   - However, there is skepticism about the feasibility of such quick resolutions without concrete plans or concessions. Biden's administration, which until January 20, 2025, is still operational, has maintained robust military support for Ukraine, potentially discouraging premature ceasefire announcements.

3. **Current Military and Diplomatic Context**:
   - The ongoing military actions and strategic positioning, as indicated by continued Ukrainian military preparations and U.S. provision of long-range missiles, suggest neither side is currently prepared to capitulate or settle for less-than-favorable terms.
   - The various peace discussions and summits expected or planned for early 2025 further indicate that significant diplomatic negotiations are not being centered on the immediate or short-term horizon.

4. **Statements and News Analysis**:
   - Statements from Ukrainian officials, notably Zelensky, emphasize a willingness to pursue the war into 2025, indicating a lack of urgency or readiness to negotiate a full ceasefire soon.
   - The possible delayed Trump peace plan and expected diplomatic initiatives in early 2025 signal that any comprehensive negotiations are planned for a post-inauguration period.

5. **External Influences and Pressure**:
   - The geopolitical environment, with tensions and involvement from NATO countries and economic pressures on both Russia and Ukraine, complicates and extends the timeline for a ceasefire.
   - Russia's continuing demands for recognition of territorial claims as part of any peace resolution demands make it challenging for Ukraine to agree without significant pressure or incentive shifts.

In integrating these insights with superforecasting principles:
- The inside view (current political claims, military actions, and diplomatic statements) and the outside view (historical precedents and typical conflict resolution timelines) both weigh heavily against a quick announcement of a bilateral ceasefire.
- Adjusting for potential under-reactions to geopolitical pressures and overreliance on political rhetoric without firm action, the probability remains low.

   - The recent U.S. election of Donald Trump introduces potential variability, with his repeated claims of ending the war quickly, possibly by leveraging his perceived ability to negotiate with key leaders like Zelensky and Putin.
   - However, there is skepticism about the feasibility of such quick resolutions without concrete plans or concessions. Biden's administration, which until January 20, 2025, is still operational, has maintained robust military support for Ukraine, potentially discouraging premature ceasefire announcements.

3. **Current Military and Diplomatic Context**:
   - The ongoing military actions and strategic positioning, as indicated by continued Ukrainian military preparations and U.S. provision of long-range missiles, suggest neither side is currently prepared to capitulate or settle for less-than-favorable terms.
   - The various peace discussions and summits expected or planned for early 2025 further indicate that significant diplomatic negotiations are not being centered on the immediate or short-term horizon.

4. **Statements and News Analysis**:
   - Statements from Ukrainian officials, notably Zelensky, emphasize a willingness to pursue the war into 2025, indicating a lack of urgency or readiness to negotiate a full ceasefire soon.
   - The possible delayed Trump peace plan and expected diplomatic initiatives in early 2025 signal that any comprehensive negotiations are planned for a post-inauguration period.

5. **External Influences and Pressure**:
   - The geopolitical environment, with tensions and involvement from NATO countries and economic pressures on both Russia and Ukraine, complicates and extends the timeline for a ceasefire.
   - Russia's continuing demands for recognition of territorial claims as part of any peace resolution demands make it challenging for Ukraine to agree without significant pressure or incentive shifts.

In integrating these insights with superforecasting principles:
- The inside view (current political claims, military actions, and diplomatic statements) and the outside view (historical precedents and typical conflict resolution timelines) both weigh heavily against a quick announcement of a bilateral ceasefire.
- Adjusting for potential under-reactions to geopolitical pressures and overreliance on political rhetoric without firm action, the probability remains low.

To forecast whether a bilateral ceasefire will be announced in the Ukraine war before January 1, 2025, I need to analyze the situation carefully:

1. **Base Rates and Historical Reference**: Historically, wars involving major powers take considerable time to reach a ceasefire agreement, especially ones involving territorial disputes and military commitments from international allies. Absent strong diplomatic incentives or pressures, swift resolutions are uncommon.

2. **Current Political Dynamics**:
   - The recent U.S. election of Donald Trump introduces potential variability, with his repeated claims of ending the war quickly, possibly by leveraging his perceived ability to negotiate with key leaders like Zelensky and Putin.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Arguments For Higher Probability:
1. Trump's election victory and repeated promises to end the war within 24 hours of taking office (January 20, 2025)
2. Multiple sources indicate active preparation of peace plans by Trump's team
3. Poland's PM Tusk and other European leaders expressing confidence in an upcoming ceasefire
4. Turkey potentially hosting peace talks before January 2025
5. Ukraine showing increasing flexibility on conditions, with Zelensky saying war could end by 2025
6. Growing war fatigue among Western allies and pressure for resolution

Key Arguments For Lower Probability:
1. Question requires announcement before January 1, 2025 - before Trump takes office
2. Zelensky explicitly denied current ceasefire discussions in recent statements
3. Ukrainian Foreign Minister's recent comments about continuing attacks suggest no immediate plans
4. Russia's conditions (territorial concessions) remain unacceptable to Ukraine
5. Expert Alexander Musiyenko predicts negotiations unlikely before fall 2025
6. Both sides still pursuing military objectives with US allowing new missile capabilities

Breaking down sub-probabilities:
- Chance of pre-Trump ceasefire (before Jan 1): Very low (~10-15%)
- Chance of immediate post-inauguration ceasefire (after Jan 20): Much higher (~40-50%)
- Chance of no ceasefire in early 2025: Moderate (~35-45%)

Key timing issue: The resolution date (January 1, 2025) comes before Trump's inauguration (January 20, 2025), significantly reducing probability since most peace initiatives seem tied to Trump taking office.

Additional uncertainty factors:
- Continued military operations could change battlefield dynamics
- Possible secret negotiations not yet public
- Domestic political considerations in all countries involved

My Prediction: Between 12.50% and 22.50%, with 17.50% being the most likely. Probability: 17.50%.

2024-11-20 13:18:47,233 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30274:
To forecast the probability of a bilateral ceasefire being announced in the Ukraine war before January 1, 2025, I will follow a structured approach, taking into account historical patterns, current developments, and competing forces in the conflict.

### Base Rate Estimate:
1. **Historical Base Rates**: Historically, major international conflicts do not resolve quickly through mutual agreements, especially when geopolitical stakes are high, as in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. A ceasefire in a similar high-stakes conflict can take several years to reach, often mediated by international parties. The typical time frame for ceasefires or peace agreements in such wars tends to be longer than current circumstances allow.

2. **Reference Class**: Other recent major conflicts such as those in the Middle East (e.g., the Syrian Civil War, the Yemen conflict) have shown protracted durations before significant ceasefires or peace agreements are reached. These conflicts often involve multiple stakeholders and complex geopolitical interests.

### Current Context Assessment:
1. **Inside View**: The current situation in Ukraine is notably complex. The recent election of Donald Trump and his vague assertions about ending the war within 24 hours after taking office provides some optimism but lacks concrete evidence or detailed plans.

2. **US Political Climate**: The change in US presidency might influence negotiations, yet significant skepticism remains regarding the effectiveness of Trump's potential actions.

3. **Statements from Leaders**: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has explicitly stated that a ceasefire without substantial security guarantees is unacceptable. Russian demands are also stringent, seeking NATO non-membership from Ukraine, which complicates potential agreement grounds.

4. **War Dynamics**: Military dynamics present uncertain outcomes. Ukraine has received new military support, while Russia endures significant troop losses and demographic pressures, potentially incentivizing a ceasefire. However, the news suggests upcoming increased military actions.

5. **International Pressure**: There is mounting “war fatigue” in Western allies, which might tilt toward diplomatic solutions but ventures into peace agreements still appear preliminary.

### Competing Forces:
1. **For Status Quo**: The continuation of the conflict without diplomatic resolution may persist, driven by maximalist goals, unclear negotiation stances from key players, and ongoing military engagements.
   
2. **For Ceasefire**: Potential diplomatic engagement spurred by the new US administration, possible burgeoning negotiations involving Turkey, and strategic pauses required from the Russian side.

### Conclusion:
Balancing the aforementioned factors, the likelihood of a bilateral ceasefire being signed and announced by both the Ukrainian and Russian governments before January 1, 2025, remains low given the short timeframe, entrenched positions, and historical precedents of such conflicts lasting longer.

My forecast reflects both cautious optimism for diplomatic movement while recognizing significant barriers to reaching a comprehensive ceasefire agreement within the set period.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

Balancing the aforementioned factors, the likelihood of a bilateral ceasefire being signed and announced by both the Ukrainian and Russian governments before January 1, 2025, remains low given the short timeframe, entrenched positions, and historical precedents of such conflicts lasting longer.

My forecast reflects both cautious optimism for diplomatic movement while recognizing significant barriers to reaching a comprehensive ceasefire agreement within the set period.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To forecast the probability of a bilateral ceasefire being announced in the Ukraine war before January 1, 2025, I will follow a structured approach, taking into account historical patterns, current developments, and competing forces in the conflict.

### Base Rate Estimate:
1. **Historical Base Rates**: Historically, major international conflicts do not resolve quickly through mutual agreements, especially when geopolitical stakes are high, as in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. A ceasefire in a similar high-stakes conflict can take several years to reach, often mediated by international parties. The typical time frame for ceasefires or peace agreements in such wars tends to be longer than current circumstances allow.

2. **Reference Class**: Other recent major conflicts such as those in the Middle East (e.g., the Syrian Civil War, the Yemen conflict) have shown protracted durations before significant ceasefires or peace agreements are reached. These conflicts often involve multiple stakeholders and complex geopolitical interests.

### Current Context Assessment:
1. **Inside View**: The current situation in Ukraine is notably complex. The recent election of Donald Trump and his vague assertions about ending the war within 24 hours after taking office provides some optimism but lacks concrete evidence or detailed plans.

2. **US Political Climate**: The change in US presidency might influence negotiations, yet significant skepticism remains regarding the effectiveness of Trump's potential actions.

3. **Statements from Leaders**: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has explicitly stated that a ceasefire without substantial security guarantees is unacceptable. Russian demands are also stringent, seeking NATO non-membership from Ukraine, which complicates potential agreement grounds.

4. **War Dynamics**: Military dynamics present uncertain outcomes. Ukraine has received new military support, while Russia endures significant troop losses and demographic pressures, potentially incentivizing a ceasefire. However, the news suggests upcoming increased military actions.

5. **International Pressure**: There is mounting “war fatigue” in Western allies, which might tilt toward diplomatic solutions but ventures into peace agreements still appear preliminary.

### Competing Forces:
1. **For Status Quo**: The continuation of the conflict without diplomatic resolution may persist, driven by maximalist goals, unclear negotiation stances from key players, and ongoing military engagements.
   
2. **For Ceasefire**: Potential diplomatic engagement spurred by the new US administration, possible burgeoning negotiations involving Turkey, and strategic pauses required from the Russian side.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key factors supporting a higher probability:
1. Trump's election victory and consistent promises to end the war quickly
2. Multiple reports suggest Trump's team is preparing specific peace plans
3. Poland's PM Tusk and EU's Borrell both expect ceasefire proposals after Trump's inauguration
4. Turkey appears positioned as a potential mediator for peace talks
5. Ukraine showing signs of military exhaustion and recognition of difficult position
6. Zelensky's recent statements suggest openness to ending war by 2025

Key factors supporting a lower probability:
1. Trump doesn't take office until January 20, 2025 - after the resolution date
2. Zelensky explicitly ruled out ceasefire without security guarantees
3. Russia maintains firm positions on territorial demands
4. Ukraine continues receiving new military support (ATACMS approval)
5. Ukrainian officials like Musiyenko predict negotiations unlikely before fall 2025
6. Complex security guarantees needed would take time to negotiate

Timing is crucial here:
- The question resolves before January 1, 2025
- Trump isn't inaugurated until January 20, 2025
- Most sources suggesting ceasefire tie it to Trump's presidency

Key uncertainties:
- Possibility of pre-inauguration negotiations
- Whether current back-channel discussions might accelerate timeline
- Impact of winter conditions on military situation

Looking at recent developments:
- Ukrainian Foreign Minister's comments about ATACMS suggest continued focus on military action
- Multiple sources indicate serious peace planning but timed for after Trump's inauguration
- No indication of immediate breakthrough in current diplomatic channels

The timing constraint (before January 1, 2025) is particularly limiting, as most peace initiatives appear tied to Trump's presidency which begins after this date.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%

- Possibility of pre-inauguration negotiations
- Whether current back-channel discussions might accelerate timeline
- Impact of winter conditions on military situation

Looking at recent developments:
- Ukrainian Foreign Minister's comments about ATACMS suggest continued focus on military action
- Multiple sources indicate serious peace planning but timed for after Trump's inauguration
- No indication of immediate breakthrough in current diplomatic channels

The timing constraint (before January 1, 2025) is particularly limiting, as most peace initiatives appear tied to Trump's presidency which begins after this date.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key factors supporting a higher probability:
1. Trump's election victory and consistent promises to end the war quickly
2. Multiple reports suggest Trump's team is preparing specific peace plans
3. Poland's PM Tusk and EU's Borrell both expect ceasefire proposals after Trump's inauguration
4. Turkey appears positioned as a potential mediator for peace talks
5. Ukraine showing signs of military exhaustion and recognition of difficult position
6. Zelensky's recent statements suggest openness to ending war by 2025

Key factors supporting a lower probability:
1. Trump doesn't take office until January 20, 2025 - after the resolution date
2. Zelensky explicitly ruled out ceasefire without security guarantees
3. Russia maintains firm positions on territorial demands
4. Ukraine continues receiving new military support (ATACMS approval)
5. Ukrainian officials like Musiyenko predict negotiations unlikely before fall 2025
6. Complex security guarantees needed would take time to negotiate

Timing is crucial here:
- The question resolves before January 1, 2025
- Trump isn't inaugurated until January 20, 2025
- Most sources suggesting ceasefire tie it to Trump's presidency
