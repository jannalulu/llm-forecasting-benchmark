**Expired COVID-19 Tests: US Experts Say They Can Still Be Effective Up to 1 Year**
As COVID-19 cases rise, experts expect a peak between January and March. Many people still have unused rapid COVID-19 tests at home. However, the effectiveness of these tests after expiration is unclear. German medical professionals are divided on the matter, with some saying the test results are worthless after expiration, while others claim they can still be used for up to three months after the expiration date if stored properly. Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, disagrees, stating, 'With proper storage, some COVID-19 tests can still function properly up to one year after the expiration date listed on the packaging.' According to Schaffner, the FDA regularly checks the expiration dates and effectiveness of COVID-19 tests on the market. The FDA advises citizens to consider tips on their website for using expired tests.

**Belarusians Still Fear COVID-19, Says Infectious Disease Specialist**
Belarusians still fear COVID-19, said Dr. Svyatoslav Velygin, the chief external infectious disease specialist of the Committee on Health of the Minsk City Executive Committee. 'The population, I think, is still excessively afraid of COVID-19, taking into account what we have gone through during this pandemic,' he noted. Dr. Velygin added that COVID-19 is now acquiring characteristics of a seasonal infection and that it is no longer necessary to treat it in a hospital. He also noted that Belarusians are gradually acquiring immunity to the virus, which is a positive trend. The fear of COVID-19 among Belarusians is also due to the fact that patients from high-risk groups may experience severe illness. This often occurs due to underlying chronic diseases, such as oncological, cardiological, and other conditions. Dr. Velygin also assured that new variants of the coronavirus will continue to appear. 'Of course, viruses are evolving faster than us. It's hard to predict, but just like with the flu, where the composition of vaccines is revised annually, there is a network of WHO laboratories that know which strains are relevant worldwide, and based on this, three to four main genotypes are included in the composition of the current vaccines. The same will be true for COVID-19,' he said. Dr. Velygin also reassured Belarusians that the Russian vaccine against COVID-19 includes the 'omicron' variant, which increases its effectiveness. 'The XEC coronavirus strain was detected in Belarus' was reported by Tochka.by in mid-October 2024. Specialists at the Republican Center for Hygiene, Epidemiology, and Public Health are constantly monitoring the emergence of new coronavirus variants in the country. 'The country has all the necessary laboratory equipment for conducting diagnostic research on coronaviruses,' the Ministry of Health assured. Dr. Grigory Getyuk, deputy chief physician of the Minsk City Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology, previously noted that compared to last year, COVID-19 cases in the capital have decreased by 17%, but the infection has not disappeared from the country. On the other hand, medics are prepared for any development and hope that the situation will not get out of control in the future.

**COVID-19 Variant XEC Is Highly Transmissible: Should We Be Worried?**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has emerged in the United States and is rapidly spreading, potentially becoming the dominant strain this winter. According to health experts, XEC is a subvariant of Omicron, first detected in Germany in June 2024, and is not currently believed to cause more severe symptoms than other recent strains. However, COVID-19 infections still pose a greater risk for certain people, like older adults and those with weakened immune systems. Dr. Scott Roberts from Yale Medicine notes that XEC's rapid spread in some European countries indicates its potential to become the dominant strain in the coming months. Current COVID-19 vaccines, updated for the 2024-2025 season, are expected to provide some level of protection against XEC, and vaccination is recommended for everyone aged six months and older to help minimize the spread of the virus. Dr. Roberts advises following standard precautions, such as staying away from sick individuals, wearing masks in crowded indoor settings, and considering antivirals like Paxlovid if you test positive for COVID-19.

**CDC: XEC COVID-19 variant circulating in the US**
The XEC COVID-19 variant is now circulating in the United States, making up about 10% of all COVID-19 cases reported in the country as of October 13, according to the CDC's Nowcast tracking tool. The variant is a recombinant of the Omicron strain and has spread across Germany, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands. A CDC official described XEC as a 'recombinant, or hybrid, of the closely related Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3.' UK Health Security Agency epidemiologist Jamie Lopez Bernal said that their surveillance has shown that about 1 in 10 COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom come from the XEC lineage, but 'current information doesn't suggest we should be more concerned about this variant.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants in the population, including XEC, but stressed that 'specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' The CDC spokesperson recommended that people aged 6 months and older get one of the updated COVID-19 vaccines that were signed off by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over the summer. COVID-19 levels are currently at 'low' levels across the United States, with 'high' levels reported in most New England states, the Pacific Northwest, and several mountain region states.

**New COVID XEC Variant: What You Need to Know | 🔬 LatestLY**
The COVID-19 XEC variant has been detected in Germany, and is believed to have formed when the KP.3 variant joined with KS.1.1. According to Francois Balloux, Professor of Computational Systems Biology, 'XEC is a likely recombinant between the subvariants KP.3.3 and KS.1.1.' The XEC variant has been reported in double-digits in Germany since June, but its spread is difficult to predict. In contrast, the KP.3.1.1 variant remains the most dominant, with a potential to be more dangerous than previous versions of SARS-CoV-2. The CDC has warned that KP.3.1.1 is particularly acute for people older than 65 years of age and children younger than 2 years. The US CDC has recommended people get an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine.

**XEC Variant of COVID-19: What We Know So Far**
The XEC variant of COVID-19 is being closely monitored by the US and over a dozen European countries. Experts agree that due to its rapid spread, XEC could become the dominant sub-variant during the winter season. According to Dr. Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, XEC 'seems to be the variant that has the most probability of developing' in the coming months. Currently, Europe is experiencing the highest number of cases in the world, with 309,941 cases reported in the last 28 days (as of October 6, 2024). The UKHSA has recently warned about the surge in cases related to the new strain. In the US, at least 24 states have confirmed the presence of this variant. The World Health Organization (WHO) is keeping XEC under surveillance, but it is not yet considered a variant of concern. According to the WHO, XEC occupies the second place in terms of prevalence, with the KP.3.1.1 variant still leading. The symptoms of XEC are similar to those of other recent variants, including: cough, fatigue, sore throat, headache, congestion, runny nose, diarrhea, fever or chills, and difficulty breathing. There is no evidence that XEC causes different symptoms or a more severe illness compared to recent variants. Dr. Scott Roberts, an infectious disease specialist at Yale Medicine, stated that XEC was born from two sub-variants of Omicron, and therefore, all updated vaccines that target this strain should be effective against it. This includes the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna (designed to target KP.2) and the latest Novavax vaccine that also targets an earlier strain, JN.1. Adults over 65 and people with comorbidities are the most vulnerable to this and any other COVID-19 variant. In Mexico, there have been no reports of XEC circulation. The country's predominant strain is still JN.1, although KP.3 has gained relevance. From January to October 2024, there have been 138,807 cases of COVID-19 and 625 deaths in Mexico, according to the Subsecretaría de Prevención y Promoción de la Salud. A nationwide vaccination campaign against influenza and COVID-19 will be held from October 15, 2024, to March 28, 2025, with over 156,000 immunologicals to be administered.

**XEC COVID Variant Circulating in the US, CDC Says**
Recent estimates published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that the XEC variant of COVID-19 is already circulating in the interior of the United States. According to the CDC's Nowcast tracking tool, XEC represents around 10% of all COVID-19 cases reported in the country as of October 13. It is now the second most common COVID-19 strain in the country, behind the K.P.3.1.1 variant that emerged at the beginning of this year. Both variants derive from the Omicron strain that emerged at the end of 2021. The XEC variant first appeared in Berlin at the end of June and spread to Germany, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands, according to a report by data integration specialist Mike Honey, citing the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data. 'We are watching this variant closely, but the information we have does not suggest that we should be more concerned about it,' said Jamie López Bernal, epidemiologist at the UK's Health Security Agency. 'We understand that people may be worried about new variants.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants in the population, including XEC, but emphasizes that 'cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' According to Rosa Norman, CDC spokesperson, 'please continue to check the COVID Data Tracker for updated information on the common variants we are seeing in the US.' There is no evidence of any specific symptoms associated with the XEC variant or co-circulating strains. 'However, this new variant is likely to be similar to other COVID variants in terms of the disease it causes, given its similar genetic information. So, we can expect symptoms such as high fever, sore throat with cough, headaches and body aches, and fatigue,' noted GAVI, an organization aimed at increasing vaccination in poorer countries. The CDC recommends that people aged 6 months and older receive one of the updated COVID-19 vaccines approved by the US FDA during the summer. 'At this time, we anticipate that treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 will continue to work against all circulating variants,' said Norman. 'The CDC will continue to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and vaccines against circulating variants.' COVID-19 levels are currently 'low' in the US, according to CDC data as of October 5. However, a map provided by the agency shows that COVID-19 levels are 'high' in most states of New England, as well as in the northwest Pacific and several states in the mountainous region. Oregon and Montana are the only states in the country with 'very high' levels of viral activity, according to the CDC. Several other states also reported elevated levels of COVID-19.

**COVID-19 XEC variant is now circulating in the US. Here's what you should know about it.**
The COVID-19 XEC variant is now circulating in the US, according to the CDC. The variant, a recombinant of the Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, has been seen in hundreds of cases in Germany, France, Denmark, and Netherlands. The CDC's Nowcast data tracker shows that the KP.3.1.1 variant accounted for 57.2% of positive infections, followed by XEC at 10.7% in the two-week stretch starting on Sept. 29 and ending on Oct. 12. Rosa Norman, a CDC spokesperson, said, 'CDC is monitoring the XEC variant.' The CDC has not reported any new or unusual symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2. The basic symptoms of COVID-19 can appear between two and 14 days after exposure to the virus and can range from mild to severe. The CDC advises seeking medical attention if you have the following symptoms: 'CDC is not aware of new or unusual symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2,' Norman said.

**Covid, la variante Xec dilaga: tre cose da sapere**
A new subvariant of the coronavirus, XEC, is spreading rapidly in the United States and could become the dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 by winter, when COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations tend to peak. According to experts, XEC is a recombinant variant, resulting from the fusion and reorganization of two pre-existing subvariants: Omicron KP.3.3 and KS.1.1. While there is no evidence that XEC causes different symptoms or more severe diseases than other recent variants, an infection remains concerning for certain individuals, such as the elderly or immunocompromised. As of September 30, XEC accounted for 5.7% of COVID-19 infections in the US, making it the fifth most widespread variant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Scott Roberts, an infectious disease specialist at Yale Medicine, warns that XEC has spread rapidly in some European areas, surpassing the growth of all other SARS-CoV-2 variants. 'The rate of XEC infections we're seeing in some countries has increased quite rapidly compared to previous variants,' he says. The CDC has reported XEC in at least 25 US states. As people begin to receive updated COVID-19 vaccines for the 2024-2025 season, available in the US since August, Roberts encourages everyone 6 months and older to get vaccinated with the updated vaccine to protect against the virus. 'One of the reasons for concern is that XEC has spread quite rapidly in some areas of Europe,' Roberts says. 'The rate of XEC infections we're seeing in some countries has increased quite rapidly compared to previous variants.'

**New COVID-19 Variant XEC Accounts For 5.7 Percent Of US Cases In 2 Weeks: CDC**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has been identified in the United States, accounting for approximately 5.7% of new cases in the past two weeks, according to the CDC. While experts are uncertain about the extent of XEC's spread, its emergence has raised concerns about the ongoing evolution of the virus. Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist, said, 'We don't know if it will become a major player, but it has the characteristics that could make it a variant to watch.' XEC is a recombinant of two other strains and has rapidly spread in parts of Europe, prompting concerns about its potential impact in the US. However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that XEC is more contagious or causes more severe illness than existing variants. Epidemiologists are closely monitoring the spread of XEC to determine whether it is surpassing other variants. Initial findings suggest that vaccines, particularly those with bivalent boosters targeting Omicron, still offer protection against severe illness and hospitalization, but breakthrough infections are possible, especially among people who have not received recent booster doses.

**XEC: a new coronavirus variant with potential to become dominant worldwide**
A new variant of the coronavirus, called XEC, is spreading rapidly and has the potential to become the dominant variant worldwide, according to The Conversation. Detected for the first time in Germany in August 2024, XEC is a 'recombinant variant', resulting from the exchange of genetic material between two parental variants: KS.1.1 and KP.3.3. Both variants evolved from JN.1, which was the global dominant variant at the beginning of 2024. Since its identification, XEC has been registered in over 600 cases in 27 countries, including the US, Germany, UK, Canada, and Denmark. The detection of the variant occurs through a public database known as Gisaid, which collects genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. The number of cases may be higher in countries that do not regularly sequence virus samples. XEC currently represents a small percentage of infections, with higher prevalence in Germany (around 13%) and lower in the US (less than 5%). Despite its current classification as a minority variant, XEC has shown a growth advantage over other circulating variants, suggesting it may become dominant in the coming months. A characteristic of XEC is the presence of specific mutations in the spike protein, crucial for infection, including the mutation T22N, from KS.1.1, and the mutation Q493E, from KP.3.3. These mutations may influence the virus's ability to replicate and spread, although there is not yet enough data to determine if XEC causes more severe diseases. The expected symptoms associated with this new variant are similar to those of other variants, including fever, sore throat, headaches, and fatigue. With the approaching winter, an increase in hospitalizations is expected due to the colder climate and increased virus spread, which should not be automatically attributed to the new variant. The UK's autumn vaccination campaign will begin in October, with updated vaccines for the JN.1 variant, from which XEC derives. This vaccination aims to ensure a good level of protection against severe diseases. Although XEC may become the dominant variant, the continuous evolution of the virus means that other variants, such as MV.1, which also presents the T22N mutation, are being monitored. MV.1 was identified in India at the end of June and quickly spread, becoming a variant to be observed in the future. The dynamics of coronavirus variants continue to be a concern for public health, as the virus naturally evolves.

**Is the hybrid COVID variant XEC in the US? What to know about the new strain that's more contagious**
The hybrid COVID-19 strain XEC, a recombinant of the Omicron variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, has been reported in at least 25 US states, according to RTI International epidemiologist Joëlla W. Adams. While there's no indication that XEC will increase the severity of the virus, it could potentially become a dominant strain due to its increased contagiousness. However, current COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots are effective against XEC as it is a hybrid of two Omicron strains. Adams said, 'We often use what happens in Europe as a good indication of what might happen here.' The CDC continues to monitor the emergence of variants in the population and recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the virus. The dominant COVID-19 variant KP.3.1.1 accounts for over 50% of cases in the US, according to recent CDC projections.

**New Coronavirus Variant 'XEC' Spreads Rapidly Across the World**
Scientists worldwide have warned about the new variant of the coronavirus, known as 'XEC', which is highly contagious and spreading rapidly across Europe, the United States, and the world. According to the BBC, the new variant, a sub-variant of 'Omicron', began spreading in Berlin, Germany in June, and quickly spread to other parts of Europe, North America, and Asia. By September, the variant had been detected in 27 countries, including Germany, Poland, Luxembourg, Norway, Ukraine, China, Denmark, the UK, Portugal, and the Netherlands. According to Russia Today, the new variant has some new mutations that help it spread quickly, making it a hybrid of the previously discovered sub-variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3 of the 'Omicron' strain. Dr. Joanne Waldstreicher, an infectious disease expert, said, 'The new XEC variant is more transmissible than other variants, but the available COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are effective against it.' However, the variant may become the dominant strain, as Omicron variants are the most contagious. Nevertheless, the available COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are effective against the new XEC variant, which is a hybrid of two Omicron sub-variants. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to monitor the spread of the variant, and recommends that everyone aged 6 months and older receive the updated COVID-19 vaccine for the 2024-2025 season, regardless of previous vaccination or infection status. 'The new XEC variant is more transmissible than other variants, but the available COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are effective against it,' said Dr. Joanne Waldstreicher. 'Like other respiratory infections, COVID-19 and its new variants will spread more during the fall and winter seasons as students return to school and spend more time indoors, and visit family for holidays.'

**New Covid-19 Variant XEC: A Potential Next Dominant Strain?**
The new Covid-19 variant XEC has been identified in Germany in June 2024 and is considered by some experts as the next dominant variant. According to Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, XEC is a hybrid of the variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, and is spreading rapidly. Mike Honey, a data scientist, reports that XEC has increased in 27 countries across three continents, with strong growth in Denmark and Germany (16-17%), the UK and Netherlands (11-13%). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that a limited number of XEC detections have been reported in Europe, and it is too early to evaluate the variant's transmissibility, severity, or vaccine efficacy. The ECDC estimates that XEC will have similar characteristics to its cousins currently in circulation, and that the current vaccines will remain effective. Dr. Eric Topol estimates that it will take several weeks or months for XEC to become established and cause a new wave of infections. The ECDC is monitoring the situation closely, and vaccination remains the best protection against Covid-19.

**New COVID-19 variant making its way to California: What to know about XEC variant**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has been spreading rapidly across multiple countries, including the United States and California. According to data integration specialist Mike Honey, the variant has been recorded in 27 countries and has a total of around 550 samples. Dr. Dean Blumberg, Chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at UC Davis Health, stated, 'We are still in early days, so it could be a dominant strain, or it could fizzle out and die. It's very difficult to predict.' The CDC has not confirmed any unique symptoms of the XEC variant, but recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the virus. Meanwhile, California has seen a slowdown in COVID-19 infections and deaths since late August, with a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and detections in wastewater.

**New COVID variant, XEC, has spread to half of US states, reports say**
The new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has spread to at least 25 U.S. states, according to data from the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). The variant is not yet being tracked by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr. Jake Glanville, an infectious diseases expert, stated that XEC is a shuffling of two descendants of last year's JN.1 strain and does not appear to have any unusual infection symptoms. Dr. Marc Siegel, a senior medical analyst for Fox News, agreed that the current 2024-2025 vaccines should cover the emerging XEC subvariant, which includes common symptoms such as sore throat, congestion, cough, fatigue, nausea, and loss of taste. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for the 2024-2025 season, which are fully approved for people 12 years and older, and granted emergency authorization for children 6 months through 11 years of age.

**Latest COVID variant, XEC, has spread to half of US states, reports say**
The latest COVID-19 variant, XEC, has spread to at least 25 U.S. states, according to data from the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). The variant is not yet being tracked by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr. Jake Glanville, an infectious diseases expert, stated that XEC is a mutated strain of the JN.1 strain and may be more infectious than other strains, but does not appear to have any distinct symptoms or mode of infection. The current vaccines are based on the KP.2 strain, which is a reasonable match for XEC. Dr. Glanville noted that it's possible for a new variant to evolve into mutations that cause new types of symptoms, but that isn't currently happening with XEC. Dr. Marc Siegel agreed that the current 2024-2025 vaccines should cover the emerging XEC subvariant and recommends the updated vaccine for certain groups, including the elderly and young children.

**More Than Half of US States Grappling With New COVID-19 Variant XEC; Here's What You Should Know**
The new COVID-19 variant XEC has been detected in 25 US states, with the highest number of cases reported in New Jersey, where at least 15 new infections have been confirmed. According to Carla Finkelstein, head of the molecular diagnostics lab at Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, 'We do not see a particular trend. We should keep an eye on the samples coming and continue genomic screening more broadly.' The XEC variant, identified in Germany in June, has some new mutations that help it spread, but vaccines should still prevent severe cases, experts say. The symptoms of XEC are the same as those of previous variants, including high fever, body aches, tiredness and fatigue, and a cough or sore throat. Doctors note that most people feel better within a few weeks of getting COVID-19, but it can take longer to recover. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the virus will likely climb again over the winter, peaking in mid-January.

**XEC: what you need to know about the new COVID variant**
A new COVID variant, XEC, is spreading rapidly and could become the dominant variant globally in the next few months. XEC is a recombinant variant, resulting from the exchange of genetic material between the KS.1.1 and KP.3.3 variants. It has a growth advantage over other circulating variants, but its prevalence is currently highest in Germany, where around 13% of sequences are potentially XEC. The variant's spread is being monitored, and while it is unclear if it causes worse disease, symptoms are expected to be similar to other COVID variants. The UK's autumn booster campaign will start in October, targeting the JN.1 variant, which XEC derives from, providing good protection against severe illness. XEC is the latest in a long list of COVID variants being monitored, and it may be outcompeted or replaced by a different but closely related variant in the future.

**New XEC COVID-19 variant expected to become the dominant strain soon. What we know**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, is expected to become the dominant strain soon, according to experts. XEC was first identified in Germany in June and has since been spotted in several countries, including the U.S., Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Canada, and the U.K. The variant is a rearrangement of the preexisting variants KP.3.3 and KS.1.1. While it has yet to be tracked by the CDC, at least 26 cases of XEC have been detected in the U.S. as of Sept. 3. Another variant, MV.1, is also growing in transmission and is expected to become a dominant strain. Experts remain cautious about both variants, but it may be weeks or months away from 'really taking hold.' In the meantime, public health officials are advising people to stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations, especially with the upcoming fall season. The FDA and WHO have announced vaccine guidance for the fall 2024 COVID-19 vaccine, which will target the JN.1 lineage viruses. Until the updated vaccine is released, the CDC recommends that adults 65 and older get an additional dose of the current COVID-19 vaccine, and children aged 6 months to 4 years old may need multiple doses to be up to date.

**New COVID-19 Variant XEC: What We Know So Far**
Experts have identified the next dominant COVID-19 variant, called XEC, which is a combination of the Omicron KS.1.1 and KP.3.3 lineages. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the variant is being closely monitored, but there is no concrete data on the number of cases in the US. Dr. Eric Topol stated that the variant is 'just beginning to start and expand' in the US and other parts of the world, and it may take several weeks or months for it to consolidate and cause a significant increase in cases. Dr. Marc Siegel, a medical analyst for Fox News, noted that XEC appears to be more contagious than recent variants, and common symptoms include congestion, cough, loss of smell and appetite, sore throat, and body aches. The FDA has approved new vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer for the 2024-2025 season, which are expected to offer at least some level of protection against XEC.

**New XEC COVID variant is on rise. What are its symptoms, and will it cause a surge?**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, is spreading rapidly in several countries, including Europe and North America. Experts predict that XEC could become the dominant strain in the US this fall. The variant is a recombinant of two previous variants, KP.3.3 and KS.1.1, and has at least one mutation in its spike protein. While it's unclear whether XEC will outcompete other variants, it's expected to be contagious and easily spread. The symptoms caused by XEC are similar to those caused by previous omicron variants, including fever, cough, and fatigue. The updated COVID-19 vaccine for 2024-2025 is available and recommended by the CDC for everyone ages six months and older, and is expected to provide protection against severe disease caused by XEC. Experts recommend getting vaccinated, especially for people at higher risk of developing severe disease, and taking steps to protect yourself from COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, such as testing if you have symptoms or an exposure, staying home if you're sick, and taking antivirals such as Paxlovid if prescribed.

**COVID XEC variant, reportedly more contagious, starting to spread**
The COVID XEC variant, reportedly more contagious than the Omicron variant, is starting to spread across Europe and is expected to take over in the U.S. according to some experts. Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said 'That's going to take many weeks, a couple months, before it really takes hold and starts to cause a wave.' Dr. Marc Siegel, senior medical analyst for FOX News, expects XEC to soon be in the U.S. and said 'It seems to be more contagious — it causes congestion, cough, loss of smell and appetite, sore throat and body aches.' The new COVID vaccine, approved by the FDA for the 2024-2025 season, is expected to provide some level of protection against XEC, according to Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente Southern California. 'Getting the 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine is important because protection from the COVID-19 vaccine decreases with time,' a CDC spokesperson said. The CDC recommends this fall's shot for everyone aged 6 months and older.

**COVID variant XEC seeing rapid growth across globe and the U.S. Here's what to know**
The COVID-19 variant XEC is rapidly spreading across the globe and the U.S., and is expected to become the most contagious and dominant strain heading into the winter and flu season. XEC was first identified in Germany in June and has since spread to 27 countries. According to Dr. Marc Siegel, XEC causes congestion, cough, loss of smell and appetite, sore throat, and body aches. The symptoms of XEC are similar to those of prior COVID strains and the flu, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. The CDC recommends seeking medical attention if symptoms worsen or include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or pale, gray or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds. The new COVID vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer, approved for the 2024-2025 season, are expected to provide some protection against XEC, according to Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente Southern California. The CDC recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the virus.

**Expired COVID-19 Tests: US Experts Say They Can Still Be Effective Up to 1 Year**
As COVID-19 cases rise, experts expect a peak between January and March. Many people still have unused rapid COVID-19 tests at home. However, the effectiveness of these tests after expiration is unclear. German medical professionals are divided on the matter, with some saying the test results are worthless after expiration, while others claim they can still be used for up to three months after the expiration date if stored properly. Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, disagrees, stating, 'With proper storage, some COVID-19 tests can still function properly up to one year after the expiration date listed on the packaging.' According to Schaffner, the FDA regularly checks the expiration dates and effectiveness of COVID-19 tests on the market. The FDA advises citizens to consider tips on their website for using expired tests.

**Belarusians Still Fear COVID-19, Says Infectious Disease Specialist**
Belarusians still fear COVID-19, said Dr. Svyatoslav Velygin, the chief external infectious disease specialist of the Committee on Health of the Minsk City Executive Committee. 'The population, I think, is still excessively afraid of COVID-19, taking into account what we have gone through during this pandemic,' he noted. Dr. Velygin added that COVID-19 is now acquiring characteristics of a seasonal infection and that it is no longer necessary to treat it in a hospital. He also noted that Belarusians are gradually acquiring immunity to the virus, which is a positive trend. The fear of COVID-19 among Belarusians is also due to the fact that patients from high-risk groups may experience severe illness. This often occurs due to underlying chronic diseases, such as oncological, cardiological, and other conditions. Dr. Velygin also assured that new variants of the coronavirus will continue to appear. 'Of course, viruses are evolving faster than us. It's hard to predict, but just like with the flu, where the composition of vaccines is revised annually, there is a network of WHO laboratories that know which strains are relevant worldwide, and based on this, three to four main genotypes are included in the composition of the current vaccines. The same will be true for COVID-19,' he said. Dr. Velygin also reassured Belarusians that the Russian vaccine against COVID-19 includes the 'omicron' variant, which increases its effectiveness. 'The XEC coronavirus strain was detected in Belarus' was reported by Tochka.by in mid-October 2024. Specialists at the Republican Center for Hygiene, Epidemiology, and Public Health are constantly monitoring the emergence of new coronavirus variants in the country. 'The country has all the necessary laboratory equipment for conducting diagnostic research on coronaviruses,' the Ministry of Health assured. Dr. Grigory Getyuk, deputy chief physician of the Minsk City Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology, previously noted that compared to last year, COVID-19 cases in the capital have decreased by 17%, but the infection has not disappeared from the country. On the other hand, medics are prepared for any development and hope that the situation will not get out of control in the future.

**COVID-19 Variant XEC Is Highly Transmissible: Should We Be Worried?**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has emerged in the United States and is rapidly spreading, potentially becoming the dominant strain this winter. According to health experts, XEC is a subvariant of Omicron, first detected in Germany in June 2024, and is not currently believed to cause more severe symptoms than other recent strains. However, COVID-19 infections still pose a greater risk for certain people, like older adults and those with weakened immune systems. Dr. Scott Roberts from Yale Medicine notes that XEC's rapid spread in some European countries indicates its potential to become the dominant strain in the coming months. Current COVID-19 vaccines, updated for the 2024-2025 season, are expected to provide some level of protection against XEC, and vaccination is recommended for everyone aged six months and older to help minimize the spread of the virus. Dr. Roberts advises following standard precautions, such as staying away from sick individuals, wearing masks in crowded indoor settings, and considering antivirals like Paxlovid if you test positive for COVID-19.

**CDC: XEC COVID-19 variant circulating in the US**
The XEC COVID-19 variant is now circulating in the United States, making up about 10% of all COVID-19 cases reported in the country as of October 13, according to the CDC's Nowcast tracking tool. The variant is a recombinant of the Omicron strain and has spread across Germany, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands. A CDC official described XEC as a 'recombinant, or hybrid, of the closely related Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3.' UK Health Security Agency epidemiologist Jamie Lopez Bernal said that their surveillance has shown that about 1 in 10 COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom come from the XEC lineage, but 'current information doesn't suggest we should be more concerned about this variant.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants in the population, including XEC, but stressed that 'specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' The CDC spokesperson recommended that people aged 6 months and older get one of the updated COVID-19 vaccines that were signed off by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over the summer. COVID-19 levels are currently at 'low' levels across the United States, with 'high' levels reported in most New England states, the Pacific Northwest, and several mountain region states.

**New COVID XEC Variant: What You Need to Know | 🔬 LatestLY**
The COVID-19 XEC variant has been detected in Germany, and is believed to have formed when the KP.3 variant joined with KS.1.1. According to Francois Balloux, Professor of Computational Systems Biology, 'XEC is a likely recombinant between the subvariants KP.3.3 and KS.1.1.' The XEC variant has been reported in double-digits in Germany since June, but its spread is difficult to predict. In contrast, the KP.3.1.1 variant remains the most dominant, with a potential to be more dangerous than previous versions of SARS-CoV-2. The CDC has warned that KP.3.1.1 is particularly acute for people older than 65 years of age and children younger than 2 years. The US CDC has recommended people get an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine.

**XEC Variant of COVID-19: What We Know So Far**
The XEC variant of COVID-19 is being closely monitored by the US and over a dozen European countries. Experts agree that due to its rapid spread, XEC could become the dominant sub-variant during the winter season. According to Dr. Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, XEC 'seems to be the variant that has the most probability of developing' in the coming months. Currently, Europe is experiencing the highest number of cases in the world, with 309,941 cases reported in the last 28 days (as of October 6, 2024). The UKHSA has recently warned about the surge in cases related to the new strain. In the US, at least 24 states have confirmed the presence of this variant. The World Health Organization (WHO) is keeping XEC under surveillance, but it is not yet considered a variant of concern. According to the WHO, XEC occupies the second place in terms of prevalence, with the KP.3.1.1 variant still leading. The symptoms of XEC are similar to those of other recent variants, including: cough, fatigue, sore throat, headache, congestion, runny nose, diarrhea, fever or chills, and difficulty breathing. There is no evidence that XEC causes different symptoms or a more severe illness compared to recent variants. Dr. Scott Roberts, an infectious disease specialist at Yale Medicine, stated that XEC was born from two sub-variants of Omicron, and therefore, all updated vaccines that target this strain should be effective against it. This includes the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna (designed to target KP.2) and the latest Novavax vaccine that also targets an earlier strain, JN.1. Adults over 65 and people with comorbidities are the most vulnerable to this and any other COVID-19 variant. In Mexico, there have been no reports of XEC circulation. The country's predominant strain is still JN.1, although KP.3 has gained relevance. From January to October 2024, there have been 138,807 cases of COVID-19 and 625 deaths in Mexico, according to the Subsecretaría de Prevención y Promoción de la Salud. A nationwide vaccination campaign against influenza and COVID-19 will be held from October 15, 2024, to March 28, 2025, with over 156,000 immunologicals to be administered.

**XEC COVID Variant Circulating in the US, CDC Says**
Recent estimates published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that the XEC variant of COVID-19 is already circulating in the interior of the United States. According to the CDC's Nowcast tracking tool, XEC represents around 10% of all COVID-19 cases reported in the country as of October 13. It is now the second most common COVID-19 strain in the country, behind the K.P.3.1.1 variant that emerged at the beginning of this year. Both variants derive from the Omicron strain that emerged at the end of 2021. The XEC variant first appeared in Berlin at the end of June and spread to Germany, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands, according to a report by data integration specialist Mike Honey, citing the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data. 'We are watching this variant closely, but the information we have does not suggest that we should be more concerned about it,' said Jamie López Bernal, epidemiologist at the UK's Health Security Agency. 'We understand that people may be worried about new variants.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants in the population, including XEC, but emphasizes that 'cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' According to Rosa Norman, CDC spokesperson, 'please continue to check the COVID Data Tracker for updated information on the common variants we are seeing in the US.' There is no evidence of any specific symptoms associated with the XEC variant or co-circulating strains. 'However, this new variant is likely to be similar to other COVID variants in terms of the disease it causes, given its similar genetic information. So, we can expect symptoms such as high fever, sore throat with cough, headaches and body aches, and fatigue,' noted GAVI, an organization aimed at increasing vaccination in poorer countries. The CDC recommends that people aged 6 months and older receive one of the updated COVID-19 vaccines approved by the US FDA during the summer. 'At this time, we anticipate that treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 will continue to work against all circulating variants,' said Norman. 'The CDC will continue to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and vaccines against circulating variants.' COVID-19 levels are currently 'low' in the US, according to CDC data as of October 5. However, a map provided by the agency shows that COVID-19 levels are 'high' in most states of New England, as well as in the northwest Pacific and several states in the mountainous region. Oregon and Montana are the only states in the country with 'very high' levels of viral activity, according to the CDC. Several other states also reported elevated levels of COVID-19.

**COVID-19 XEC variant is now circulating in the US. Here's what you should know about it.**
The COVID-19 XEC variant is now circulating in the US, according to the CDC. The variant, a recombinant of the Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, has been seen in hundreds of cases in Germany, France, Denmark, and Netherlands. The CDC's Nowcast data tracker shows that the KP.3.1.1 variant accounted for 57.2% of positive infections, followed by XEC at 10.7% in the two-week stretch starting on Sept. 29 and ending on Oct. 12. Rosa Norman, a CDC spokesperson, said, 'CDC is monitoring the XEC variant.' The CDC has not reported any new or unusual symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2. The basic symptoms of COVID-19 can appear between two and 14 days after exposure to the virus and can range from mild to severe. The CDC advises seeking medical attention if you have the following symptoms: 'CDC is not aware of new or unusual symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2,' Norman said.

**Covid, la variante Xec dilaga: tre cose da sapere**
A new subvariant of the coronavirus, XEC, is spreading rapidly in the United States and could become the dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 by winter, when COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations tend to peak. According to experts, XEC is a recombinant variant, resulting from the fusion and reorganization of two pre-existing subvariants: Omicron KP.3.3 and KS.1.1. While there is no evidence that XEC causes different symptoms or more severe diseases than other recent variants, an infection remains concerning for certain individuals, such as the elderly or immunocompromised. As of September 30, XEC accounted for 5.7% of COVID-19 infections in the US, making it the fifth most widespread variant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Scott Roberts, an infectious disease specialist at Yale Medicine, warns that XEC has spread rapidly in some European areas, surpassing the growth of all other SARS-CoV-2 variants. 'The rate of XEC infections we're seeing in some countries has increased quite rapidly compared to previous variants,' he says. The CDC has reported XEC in at least 25 US states. As people begin to receive updated COVID-19 vaccines for the 2024-2025 season, available in the US since August, Roberts encourages everyone 6 months and older to get vaccinated with the updated vaccine to protect against the virus. 'One of the reasons for concern is that XEC has spread quite rapidly in some areas of Europe,' Roberts says. 'The rate of XEC infections we're seeing in some countries has increased quite rapidly compared to previous variants.'

**New COVID-19 Variant XEC Accounts For 5.7 Percent Of US Cases In 2 Weeks: CDC**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has been identified in the United States, accounting for approximately 5.7% of new cases in the past two weeks, according to the CDC. While experts are uncertain about the extent of XEC's spread, its emergence has raised concerns about the ongoing evolution of the virus. Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist, said, 'We don't know if it will become a major player, but it has the characteristics that could make it a variant to watch.' XEC is a recombinant of two other strains and has rapidly spread in parts of Europe, prompting concerns about its potential impact in the US. However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that XEC is more contagious or causes more severe illness than existing variants. Epidemiologists are closely monitoring the spread of XEC to determine whether it is surpassing other variants. Initial findings suggest that vaccines, particularly those with bivalent boosters targeting Omicron, still offer protection against severe illness and hospitalization, but breakthrough infections are possible, especially among people who have not received recent booster doses.

**XEC COVID-19 Variant Emerges: Here's What We Know**
A new COVID-19 variant called XEC has emerged in multiple regions worldwide, including the US, according to the CDC. However, the CDC has stated that no specific symptoms are associated with the variant. Rosa Norman, a CDC spokeswoman, said, 'Please continue to check the COVID Data Tracker for updated information on the common variants we're seeing in the US.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants, including XEC, but Norman stated that 'specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' GAVI, a global health organization, also stated that XEC is likely to have similar symptoms to other COVID variants, such as a high temperature, sore throat, and body aches. Norman also noted that XEC is a recombinant variant of the Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, and that recombinants are not new, as seen with the XBB recombinant variant in 2023. The CDC recommends that people aged 6 months and older get a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine, which are expected to work against all circulating variants.

**XEC: a new coronavirus variant with potential to become dominant worldwide**
A new variant of the coronavirus, called XEC, is spreading rapidly and has the potential to become the dominant variant worldwide, according to The Conversation. Detected for the first time in Germany in August 2024, XEC is a 'recombinant variant', resulting from the exchange of genetic material between two parental variants: KS.1.1 and KP.3.3. Both variants evolved from JN.1, which was the global dominant variant at the beginning of 2024. Since its identification, XEC has been registered in over 600 cases in 27 countries, including the US, Germany, UK, Canada, and Denmark. The detection of the variant occurs through a public database known as Gisaid, which collects genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. The number of cases may be higher in countries that do not regularly sequence virus samples. XEC currently represents a small percentage of infections, with higher prevalence in Germany (around 13%) and lower in the US (less than 5%). Despite its current classification as a minority variant, XEC has shown a growth advantage over other circulating variants, suggesting it may become dominant in the coming months. A characteristic of XEC is the presence of specific mutations in the spike protein, crucial for infection, including the mutation T22N, from KS.1.1, and the mutation Q493E, from KP.3.3. These mutations may influence the virus's ability to replicate and spread, although there is not yet enough data to determine if XEC causes more severe diseases. The expected symptoms associated with this new variant are similar to those of other variants, including fever, sore throat, headaches, and fatigue. With the approaching winter, an increase in hospitalizations is expected due to the colder climate and increased virus spread, which should not be automatically attributed to the new variant. The UK's autumn vaccination campaign will begin in October, with updated vaccines for the JN.1 variant, from which XEC derives. This vaccination aims to ensure a good level of protection against severe diseases. Although XEC may become the dominant variant, the continuous evolution of the virus means that other variants, such as MV.1, which also presents the T22N mutation, are being monitored. MV.1 was identified in India at the end of June and quickly spread, becoming a variant to be observed in the future. The dynamics of coronavirus variants continue to be a concern for public health, as the virus naturally evolves.

**Is the hybrid COVID variant XEC in the US? What to know about the new strain that's more contagious**
The hybrid COVID-19 strain XEC, a recombinant of the Omicron variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, has been reported in at least 25 US states, according to RTI International epidemiologist Joëlla W. Adams. While there's no indication that XEC will increase the severity of the virus, it could potentially become a dominant strain due to its increased contagiousness. However, current COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots are effective against XEC as it is a hybrid of two Omicron strains. Adams said, 'We often use what happens in Europe as a good indication of what might happen here.' The CDC continues to monitor the emergence of variants in the population and recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the virus. The dominant COVID-19 variant KP.3.1.1 accounts for over 50% of cases in the US, according to recent CDC projections.

**New Coronavirus Variant 'XEC' Spreads Rapidly Across the World**
Scientists worldwide have warned about the new variant of the coronavirus, known as 'XEC', which is highly contagious and spreading rapidly across Europe, the United States, and the world. According to the BBC, the new variant, a sub-variant of 'Omicron', began spreading in Berlin, Germany in June, and quickly spread to other parts of Europe, North America, and Asia. By September, the variant had been detected in 27 countries, including Germany, Poland, Luxembourg, Norway, Ukraine, China, Denmark, the UK, Portugal, and the Netherlands. According to Russia Today, the new variant has some new mutations that help it spread quickly, making it a hybrid of the previously discovered sub-variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3 of the 'Omicron' strain. Dr. Joanne Waldstreicher, an infectious disease expert, said, 'The new XEC variant is more transmissible than other variants, but the available COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are effective against it.' However, the variant may become the dominant strain, as Omicron variants are the most contagious. Nevertheless, the available COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are effective against the new XEC variant, which is a hybrid of two Omicron sub-variants. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to monitor the spread of the variant, and recommends that everyone aged 6 months and older receive the updated COVID-19 vaccine for the 2024-2025 season, regardless of previous vaccination or infection status. 'The new XEC variant is more transmissible than other variants, but the available COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are effective against it,' said Dr. Joanne Waldstreicher. 'Like other respiratory infections, COVID-19 and its new variants will spread more during the fall and winter seasons as students return to school and spend more time indoors, and visit family for holidays.'

**New Covid-19 Variant XEC: A Potential Next Dominant Strain?**
The new Covid-19 variant XEC has been identified in Germany in June 2024 and is considered by some experts as the next dominant variant. According to Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, XEC is a hybrid of the variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, and is spreading rapidly. Mike Honey, a data scientist, reports that XEC has increased in 27 countries across three continents, with strong growth in Denmark and Germany (16-17%), the UK and Netherlands (11-13%). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that a limited number of XEC detections have been reported in Europe, and it is too early to evaluate the variant's transmissibility, severity, or vaccine efficacy. The ECDC estimates that XEC will have similar characteristics to its cousins currently in circulation, and that the current vaccines will remain effective. Dr. Eric Topol estimates that it will take several weeks or months for XEC to become established and cause a new wave of infections. The ECDC is monitoring the situation closely, and vaccination remains the best protection against Covid-19.

**New COVID-19 variant making its way to California: What to know about XEC variant**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has been spreading rapidly across multiple countries, including the United States and California. According to data integration specialist Mike Honey, the variant has been recorded in 27 countries and has a total of around 550 samples. Dr. Dean Blumberg, Chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at UC Davis Health, stated, 'We are still in early days, so it could be a dominant strain, or it could fizzle out and die. It's very difficult to predict.' The CDC has not confirmed any unique symptoms of the XEC variant, but recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the virus. Meanwhile, California has seen a slowdown in COVID-19 infections and deaths since late August, with a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and detections in wastewater.

**New COVID variant, XEC, has spread to half of US states, reports say**
The new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has spread to at least 25 U.S. states, according to data from the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). The variant is not yet being tracked by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr. Jake Glanville, an infectious diseases expert, stated that XEC is a shuffling of two descendants of last year's JN.1 strain and does not appear to have any unusual infection symptoms. Dr. Marc Siegel, a senior medical analyst for Fox News, agreed that the current 2024-2025 vaccines should cover the emerging XEC subvariant, which includes common symptoms such as sore throat, congestion, cough, fatigue, nausea, and loss of taste. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for the 2024-2025 season, which are fully approved for people 12 years and older, and granted emergency authorization for children 6 months through 11 years of age.

**Latest COVID variant, XEC, has spread to half of US states, reports say**
The latest COVID-19 variant, XEC, has spread to at least 25 U.S. states, according to data from the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). The variant is not yet being tracked by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr. Jake Glanville, an infectious diseases expert, stated that XEC is a mutated strain of the JN.1 strain and may be more infectious than other strains, but does not appear to have any distinct symptoms or mode of infection. The current vaccines are based on the KP.2 strain, which is a reasonable match for XEC. Dr. Glanville noted that it's possible for a new variant to evolve into mutations that cause new types of symptoms, but that isn't currently happening with XEC. Dr. Marc Siegel agreed that the current 2024-2025 vaccines should cover the emerging XEC subvariant and recommends the updated vaccine for certain groups, including the elderly and young children.

**More Than Half of US States Grappling With New COVID-19 Variant XEC; Here's What You Should Know**
The new COVID-19 variant XEC has been detected in 25 US states, with the highest number of cases reported in New Jersey, where at least 15 new infections have been confirmed. According to Carla Finkelstein, head of the molecular diagnostics lab at Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, 'We do not see a particular trend. We should keep an eye on the samples coming and continue genomic screening more broadly.' The XEC variant, identified in Germany in June, has some new mutations that help it spread, but vaccines should still prevent severe cases, experts say. The symptoms of XEC are the same as those of previous variants, including high fever, body aches, tiredness and fatigue, and a cough or sore throat. Doctors note that most people feel better within a few weeks of getting COVID-19, but it can take longer to recover. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the virus will likely climb again over the winter, peaking in mid-January.

**XEC: what you need to know about the new COVID variant**
A new COVID variant, XEC, is spreading rapidly and could become the dominant variant globally in the next few months. XEC is a recombinant variant, resulting from the exchange of genetic material between the KS.1.1 and KP.3.3 variants. It has a growth advantage over other circulating variants, but its prevalence is currently highest in Germany, where around 13% of sequences are potentially XEC. The variant's spread is being monitored, and while it is unclear if it causes worse disease, symptoms are expected to be similar to other COVID variants. The UK's autumn booster campaign will start in October, targeting the JN.1 variant, which XEC derives from, providing good protection against severe illness. XEC is the latest in a long list of COVID variants being monitored, and it may be outcompeted or replaced by a different but closely related variant in the future.

**New XEC COVID-19 variant expected to become the dominant strain soon. What we know**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, is expected to become the dominant strain soon, according to experts. XEC was first identified in Germany in June and has since been spotted in several countries, including the U.S., Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Canada, and the U.K. The variant is a rearrangement of the preexisting variants KP.3.3 and KS.1.1. While it has yet to be tracked by the CDC, at least 26 cases of XEC have been detected in the U.S. as of Sept. 3. Another variant, MV.1, is also growing in transmission and is expected to become a dominant strain. Experts remain cautious about both variants, but it may be weeks or months away from 'really taking hold.' In the meantime, public health officials are advising people to stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations, especially with the upcoming fall season. The FDA and WHO have announced vaccine guidance for the fall 2024 COVID-19 vaccine, which will target the JN.1 lineage viruses. Until the updated vaccine is released, the CDC recommends that adults 65 and older get an additional dose of the current COVID-19 vaccine, and children aged 6 months to 4 years old may need multiple doses to be up to date.

**New COVID-19 Variant XEC: What We Know So Far**
Experts have identified the next dominant COVID-19 variant, called XEC, which is a combination of the Omicron KS.1.1 and KP.3.3 lineages. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the variant is being closely monitored, but there is no concrete data on the number of cases in the US. Dr. Eric Topol stated that the variant is 'just beginning to start and expand' in the US and other parts of the world, and it may take several weeks or months for it to consolidate and cause a significant increase in cases. Dr. Marc Siegel, a medical analyst for Fox News, noted that XEC appears to be more contagious than recent variants, and common symptoms include congestion, cough, loss of smell and appetite, sore throat, and body aches. The FDA has approved new vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer for the 2024-2025 season, which are expected to offer at least some level of protection against XEC.

**New XEC COVID variant is on rise. What are its symptoms, and will it cause a surge?**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, is spreading rapidly in several countries, including Europe and North America. Experts predict that XEC could become the dominant strain in the US this fall. The variant is a recombinant of two previous variants, KP.3.3 and KS.1.1, and has at least one mutation in its spike protein. While it's unclear whether XEC will outcompete other variants, it's expected to be contagious and easily spread. The symptoms caused by XEC are similar to those caused by previous omicron variants, including fever, cough, and fatigue. The updated COVID-19 vaccine for 2024-2025 is available and recommended by the CDC for everyone ages six months and older, and is expected to provide protection against severe disease caused by XEC. Experts recommend getting vaccinated, especially for people at higher risk of developing severe disease, and taking steps to protect yourself from COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, such as testing if you have symptoms or an exposure, staying home if you're sick, and taking antivirals such as Paxlovid if prescribed.

**COVID variant XEC seeing rapid growth across globe and the U.S. Here's what to know**
The COVID-19 variant XEC is rapidly spreading across the globe and the U.S., and is expected to become the most contagious and dominant strain heading into the winter and flu season. XEC was first identified in Germany in June and has since spread to 27 countries. According to Dr. Marc Siegel, XEC causes congestion, cough, loss of smell and appetite, sore throat, and body aches. The symptoms of XEC are similar to those of prior COVID strains and the flu, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. The CDC recommends seeking medical attention if symptoms worsen or include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or pale, gray or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds. The new COVID vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer, approved for the 2024-2025 season, are expected to provide some protection against XEC, according to Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente Southern California.

**Africa: Africa CDC Recommendations on Covid-19 Sub-Variant XEC**
The Africa CDC is monitoring the COVID-19 sub-variant XEC, which was first reported in May 2024 and has been detected in 43 countries across Europe, Asia, and North America. In Africa, Botswana reported one XEC case from a hospitalized European traveler. The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated XEC as a variant under monitoring (VUMs). Preliminary data suggests that XEC has increased transmissibility and unique mutations that may contribute to higher immune evasion, but there is no evidence that it causes more severe illness than previous Omicron variants. The Africa CDC advises Member States to strengthen sentinel and genomic surveillance in Africa and to be cautious in their approach to XEC. 'A rising prevalence XEC subvariant in several countries warrants a cautious approach and strengthening sentinel and genomic surveillance in Africa,' the Africa CDC statement says. 'While additional evidence is needed to determine the possible impact of XEC and other emerging variants in Africa, this statement is being sent out to increase Member State awareness of the situation.'

**COVID-19 Variant XEC Is Highly Transmissible: Should We Be Worried?**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has emerged in the United States and is rapidly spreading, potentially becoming the dominant strain this winter. According to health experts, XEC is a subvariant of Omicron, first detected in Germany in June 2024, and is not currently believed to cause more severe symptoms than other recent strains. However, COVID-19 infections still pose a greater risk for certain people, like older adults and those with weakened immune systems. Dr. Scott Roberts from Yale Medicine notes that XEC's rapid spread in some European countries indicates its potential to become the dominant strain in the coming months. Current COVID-19 vaccines, updated for the 2024-2025 season, are expected to provide some level of protection against XEC, and vaccination is recommended for everyone aged six months and older to help minimize the spread of the virus. Dr. Roberts advises following standard precautions, such as staying away from sick individuals, wearing masks in crowded indoor settings, and considering antivirals like Paxlovid if you test positive for COVID-19.

**CDC: XEC COVID-19 variant circulating in the US**
The XEC COVID-19 variant is now circulating in the United States, making up about 10% of all COVID-19 cases reported in the country as of October 13, according to the CDC's Nowcast tracking tool. The variant is a recombinant of the Omicron strain and has spread across Germany, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands. A CDC official described XEC as a 'recombinant, or hybrid, of the closely related Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3.' UK Health Security Agency epidemiologist Jamie Lopez Bernal said that their surveillance has shown that about 1 in 10 COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom come from the XEC lineage, but 'current information doesn't suggest we should be more concerned about this variant.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants in the population, including XEC, but stressed that 'specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' The CDC spokesperson recommended that people aged 6 months and older get one of the updated COVID-19 vaccines that were signed off by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over the summer. COVID-19 levels are currently at 'low' levels across the United States, with 'high' levels reported in most New England states, the Pacific Northwest, and several mountain region states.

**New COVID XEC Variant: What You Need to Know | 🔬 LatestLY**
The COVID-19 XEC variant has been detected in Germany, and is believed to have formed when the KP.3 variant joined with KS.1.1. According to Francois Balloux, Professor of Computational Systems Biology, 'XEC is a likely recombinant between the subvariants KP.3.3 and KS.1.1.' The XEC variant has been reported in double-digits in Germany since June, but its spread is difficult to predict. In contrast, the KP.3.1.1 variant remains the most dominant, with a potential to be more dangerous than previous versions of SARS-CoV-2. The CDC has warned that KP.3.1.1 is particularly acute for people older than 65 years of age and children younger than 2 years. The US CDC has recommended people get an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine.

**XEC Variant of COVID-19: What We Know So Far**
The XEC variant of COVID-19 is being closely monitored by the US and over a dozen European countries. Experts agree that due to its rapid spread, XEC could become the dominant sub-variant during the winter season. According to Dr. Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, XEC 'seems to be the variant that has the most probability of developing' in the coming months. Currently, Europe is experiencing the highest number of cases in the world, with 309,941 cases reported in the last 28 days (as of October 6, 2024). The UKHSA has recently warned about the surge in cases related to the new strain. In the US, at least 24 states have confirmed the presence of this variant. The World Health Organization (WHO) is keeping XEC under surveillance, but it is not yet considered a variant of concern. According to the WHO, XEC occupies the second place in terms of prevalence, with the KP.3.1.1 variant still leading. The symptoms of XEC are similar to those of other recent variants, including: cough, fatigue, sore throat, headache, congestion, runny nose, diarrhea, fever or chills, and difficulty breathing. There is no evidence that XEC causes different symptoms or a more severe illness compared to recent variants. Dr. Scott Roberts, an infectious disease specialist at Yale Medicine, stated that XEC was born from two sub-variants of Omicron, and therefore, all updated vaccines that target this strain should be effective against it. This includes the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna (designed to target KP.2) and the latest Novavax vaccine that also targets an earlier strain, JN.1. Adults over 65 and people with comorbidities are the most vulnerable to this and any other COVID-19 variant. In Mexico, there have been no reports of XEC circulation. The country's predominant strain is still JN.1, although KP.3 has gained relevance. From January to October 2024, there have been 138,807 cases of COVID-19 and 625 deaths in Mexico, according to the Subsecretaría de Prevención y Promoción de la Salud. A nationwide vaccination campaign against influenza and COVID-19 will be held from October 15, 2024, to March 28, 2025, with over 156,000 immunologicals to be administered.

**XEC COVID Variant Circulating in the US, CDC Says**
Recent estimates published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that the XEC variant of COVID-19 is already circulating in the interior of the United States. According to the CDC's Nowcast tracking tool, XEC represents around 10% of all COVID-19 cases reported in the country as of October 13. It is now the second most common COVID-19 strain in the country, behind the K.P.3.1.1 variant that emerged at the beginning of this year. Both variants derive from the Omicron strain that emerged at the end of 2021. The XEC variant first appeared in Berlin at the end of June and spread to Germany, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands, according to a report by data integration specialist Mike Honey, citing the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data. 'We are watching this variant closely, but the information we have does not suggest that we should be more concerned about it,' said Jamie López Bernal, epidemiologist at the UK's Health Security Agency. 'We understand that people may be worried about new variants.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants in the population, including XEC, but emphasizes that 'cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' According to Rosa Norman, CDC spokesperson, 'please continue to check the COVID Data Tracker for updated information on the common variants we are seeing in the US.' There is no evidence of any specific symptoms associated with the XEC variant or co-circulating strains. 'However, this new variant is likely to be similar to other COVID variants in terms of the disease it causes, given its similar genetic information. So, we can expect symptoms such as high fever, sore throat with cough, headaches and body aches, and fatigue,' noted GAVI, an organization aimed at increasing vaccination in poorer countries. The CDC recommends that people aged 6 months and older receive one of the updated COVID-19 vaccines approved by the US FDA during the summer. 'At this time, we anticipate that treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 will continue to work against all circulating variants,' said Norman. 'The CDC will continue to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and vaccines against circulating variants.' COVID-19 levels are currently 'low' in the US, according to CDC data as of October 5. However, a map provided by the agency shows that COVID-19 levels are 'high' in most states of New England, as well as in the northwest Pacific and several states in the mountainous region. Oregon and Montana are the only states in the country with 'very high' levels of viral activity, according to the CDC. Several other states also reported elevated levels of COVID-19.

It is now the second most common COVID-19 strain in the country, behind the K.P.3.1.1 variant. The XEC variant is a recombinant of the Omicron strain and has been spreading across Europe. A CDC official described XEC as a 'recombinant, or hybrid, of the closely related Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3.' UK Health Security Agency epidemiologist Jamie Lopez Bernal said that their surveillance has shown that about 1 in 10 COVID-19 cases in the UK come from the XEC lineage, but current information doesn't suggest that XEC is more severe. The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants in the population, including XEC, but stressed that specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants. The CDC recommends that people aged 6 months and older get one of the updated COVID-19 vaccines that were signed off by the FDA over the summer. COVID-19 levels are currently at 'low' levels across the US, with the exception of a few states in New England, the Pacific Northwest, and the mountain region.

**COVID-19 XEC variant is now circulating in the US. Here's what you should know about it.**
The COVID-19 XEC variant is now circulating in the US, according to the CDC. The variant, a recombinant of the Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, has been seen in hundreds of cases in Germany, France, Denmark, and Netherlands. The CDC's Nowcast data tracker shows that the KP.3.1.1 variant accounted for 57.2% of positive infections, followed by XEC at 10.7% in the two-week stretch starting on Sept. 29 and ending on Oct. 12. Rosa Norman, a CDC spokesperson, said, 'CDC is monitoring the XEC variant.' The CDC has not reported any new or unusual symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2. The basic symptoms of COVID-19 can appear between two and 14 days after exposure to the virus and can range from mild to severe. The CDC advises seeking medical attention if you have the following symptoms: 'CDC is not aware of new or unusual symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2,' Norman said.

**Covid, la variante Xec dilaga: tre cose da sapere**
A new subvariant of the coronavirus, XEC, is spreading rapidly in the United States and could become the dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 by winter, when COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations tend to peak. According to experts, XEC is a recombinant variant, resulting from the fusion and reorganization of two pre-existing subvariants: Omicron KP.3.3 and KS.1.1. While there is no evidence that XEC causes different symptoms or more severe diseases than other recent variants, an infection remains concerning for certain individuals, such as the elderly or immunocompromised. As of September 30, XEC accounted for 5.7% of COVID-19 infections in the US, making it the fifth most widespread variant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Scott Roberts, an infectious disease specialist at Yale Medicine, warns that XEC has spread rapidly in some European areas, surpassing the growth of all other SARS-CoV-2 variants. 'The rate of XEC infections we're seeing in some countries has increased quite rapidly compared to previous variants,' he says. The CDC has reported XEC in at least 25 US states. As people begin to receive updated COVID-19 vaccines for the 2024-2025 season, available in the US since August, Roberts encourages everyone 6 months and older to get vaccinated with the updated vaccine to protect against the virus. 'One of the reasons for concern is that XEC has spread quite rapidly in some areas of Europe,' Roberts says. 'The rate of XEC infections we're seeing in some countries has increased quite rapidly compared to previous variants.'

**New COVID-19 Variant XEC Accounts For 5.7 Percent Of US Cases In 2 Weeks: CDC**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has been identified in the United States, accounting for approximately 5.7% of new cases in the past two weeks, according to the CDC. While experts are uncertain about the extent of XEC's spread, its emergence has raised concerns about the ongoing evolution of the virus. Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist, said, 'We don't know if it will become a major player, but it has the characteristics that could make it a variant to watch.' XEC is a recombinant of two other strains and has rapidly spread in parts of Europe, prompting concerns about its potential impact in the US. However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that XEC is more contagious or causes more severe illness than existing variants. Epidemiologists are closely monitoring the spread of XEC to determine whether it is surpassing other variants. Initial findings suggest that vaccines, particularly those with bivalent boosters targeting Omicron, still offer protection against severe illness and hospitalization, but breakthrough infections are possible, especially among people who have not received recent booster doses.

**XEC COVID-19 Variant Emerges: Here's What We Know**
A new COVID-19 variant called XEC has emerged in multiple regions worldwide, including the US, according to the CDC. However, the CDC has stated that no specific symptoms are associated with the variant. Rosa Norman, a CDC spokeswoman, said, 'Please continue to check the COVID Data Tracker for updated information on the common variants we're seeing in the US.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants, including XEC, but Norman stated that 'specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' GAVI, a global health organization, also stated that XEC is likely to have similar symptoms to other COVID variants, such as a high temperature, sore throat, and body aches. Norman also noted that XEC is a recombinant variant of the Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, and that recombinants are not new, as seen with the XBB recombinant variant in 2023. The CDC recommends that people aged 6 months and older get a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine, which are expected to work against all circulating variants.

**XEC: a new coronavirus variant with potential to become dominant worldwide**
A new variant of the coronavirus, called XEC, is spreading rapidly and has the potential to become the dominant variant worldwide, according to The Conversation. Detected for the first time in Germany in August 2024, XEC is a 'recombinant variant', resulting from the exchange of genetic material between two parental variants: KS.1.1 and KP.3.3. Both variants evolved from JN.1, which was the global dominant variant at the beginning of 2024. Since its identification, XEC has been registered in over 600 cases in 27 countries, including the US, Germany, UK, Canada, and Denmark. The detection of the variant occurs through a public database known as Gisaid, which collects genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. The number of cases may be higher in countries that do not regularly sequence virus samples. XEC currently represents a small percentage of infections, with higher prevalence in Germany (around 13%) and lower in the US (less than 5%). Despite its current classification as a minority variant, XEC has shown a growth advantage over other circulating variants, suggesting it may become dominant in the coming months. A characteristic of XEC is the presence of specific mutations in the spike protein, crucial for infection, including the mutation T22N, from KS.1.1, and the mutation Q493E, from KP.3.3. These mutations may influence the virus's ability to replicate and spread, although there is not yet enough data to determine if XEC causes more severe diseases. The expected symptoms associated with this new variant are similar to those of other variants, including fever, sore throat, headaches, and fatigue. With the approaching winter, an increase in hospitalizations is expected due to the colder climate and increased virus spread, which should not be automatically attributed to the new variant. The UK's autumn vaccination campaign will begin in October, with updated vaccines for the JN.1 variant, from which XEC derives. This vaccination aims to ensure a good level of protection against severe diseases. Although XEC may become the dominant variant, the continuous evolution of the virus means that other variants, such as MV.1, which also presents the T22N mutation, are being monitored. MV.1 was identified in India at the end of June and quickly spread, becoming a variant to be observed in the future. The dynamics of coronavirus variants continue to be a concern for public health, as the virus naturally evolves.

**Is the hybrid COVID variant XEC in the US? What to know about the new strain that's more contagious**
The hybrid COVID-19 strain XEC, a recombinant of the Omicron variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, has been reported in at least 25 US states, according to RTI International epidemiologist Joëlla W. Adams. While there's no indication that XEC will increase the severity of the virus, it could potentially become a dominant strain due to its increased contagiousness. However, current COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots are effective against XEC as it is a hybrid of two Omicron strains. Adams said, 'We often use what happens in Europe as a good indication of what might happen here.' The CDC continues to monitor the emergence of variants in the population and recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the virus. The dominant COVID-19 variant KP.3.1.1 accounts for over 50% of cases in the US, according to recent CDC projections.

**New Coronavirus Variant 'XEC' Spreads Rapidly Across the World**
Scientists worldwide have warned about the new variant of the coronavirus, known as 'XEC', which is highly contagious and spreading rapidly across Europe, the United States, and the world. According to the BBC, the new variant, a sub-variant of 'Omicron', began spreading in Berlin, Germany in June, and quickly spread to other parts of Europe, North America, and Asia. By September, the variant had been detected in 27 countries, including Germany, Poland, Luxembourg, Norway, Ukraine, China, Denmark, the UK, Portugal, and the Netherlands. According to Russia Today, the new variant has some new mutations that help it spread quickly, making it a hybrid of the previously discovered sub-variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3 of the 'Omicron' strain. Dr. Joanne Waldstreicher, an infectious disease expert, said, 'The new XEC variant is more transmissible than other variants, but the available COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are effective against it.' However, the variant may become the dominant strain, as Omicron variants are the most contagious. Nevertheless, the available COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are effective against the new XEC variant, which is a hybrid of two Omicron sub-variants. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to monitor the spread of the variant, and recommends that everyone aged 6 months and older receive the updated COVID-19 vaccine for the 2024-2025 season, regardless of previous vaccination or infection status. 'The new XEC variant is more transmissible than other variants, but the available COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are effective against it,' said Dr. Joanne Waldstreicher. 'Like other respiratory infections, COVID-19 and its new variants will spread more during the fall and winter seasons as students return to school and spend more time indoors, and visit family for holidays.'

**New Covid-19 Variant XEC: A Potential Next Dominant Strain?**
The new Covid-19 variant XEC has been identified in Germany in June 2024 and is considered by some experts as the next dominant variant. According to Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, XEC is a hybrid of the variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, and is spreading rapidly. Mike Honey, a data scientist, reports that XEC has increased in 27 countries across three continents, with strong growth in Denmark and Germany (16-17%), the UK and Netherlands (11-13%). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that a limited number of XEC detections have been reported in Europe, and it is too early to evaluate the variant's transmissibility, severity, or vaccine efficacy. The ECDC estimates that XEC will have similar characteristics to its cousins currently in circulation, and that the current vaccines will remain effective. Dr. Eric Topol estimates that it will take several weeks or months for XEC to become established and cause a new wave of infections. The ECDC is monitoring the situation closely, and vaccination remains the best protection against Covid-19.

**New COVID-19 variant making its way to California: What to know about XEC variant**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has been spreading rapidly across multiple countries, including the United States and California. According to data integration specialist Mike Honey, the variant has been recorded in 27 countries and has a total of around 550 samples. Dr. Dean Blumberg, Chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at UC Davis Health, stated, 'We are still in early days, so it could be a dominant strain, or it could fizzle out and die. It's very difficult to predict.' The CDC has not confirmed any unique symptoms of the XEC variant, but recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the virus. Meanwhile, California has seen a slowdown in COVID-19 infections and deaths since late August, with a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and detections in wastewater.

**New COVID variant, XEC, has spread to half of US states, reports say**
The new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has spread to at least 25 U.S. states, according to data from the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). The variant is not yet being tracked by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr. Jake Glanville, an infectious diseases expert, stated that XEC is a shuffling of two descendants of last year's JN.1 strain and does not appear to have any unusual infection symptoms. Dr. Marc Siegel, a senior medical analyst for Fox News, agreed that the current 2024-2025 vaccines should cover the emerging XEC subvariant, which includes common symptoms such as sore throat, congestion, cough, fatigue, nausea, and loss of taste. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for the 2024-2025 season, which are fully approved for people 12 years and older, and granted emergency authorization for children 6 months through 11 years of age.

Dr. Jake Glanville, an infectious diseases expert, stated that XEC is a mutated strain of the JN.1 strain and may be more infectious than other strains, but does not appear to have any distinct symptoms or mode of infection. The current vaccines are based on the KP.2 strain, which is a reasonable match for XEC. Dr. Glanville noted that it's possible for a new variant to evolve into mutations that cause new types of symptoms, but that isn't currently happening with XEC. Dr. Marc Siegel agreed that the current 2024-2025 vaccines should cover the emerging XEC subvariant and recommends the updated vaccine for certain groups, including the elderly and young children.

**More Than Half of US States Grappling With New COVID-19 Variant XEC; Here's What You Should Know**
The new COVID-19 variant XEC has been detected in 25 US states, with the highest number of cases reported in New Jersey, where at least 15 new infections have been confirmed. According to Carla Finkelstein, head of the molecular diagnostics lab at Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, 'We do not see a particular trend. We should keep an eye on the samples coming and continue genomic screening more broadly.' The XEC variant, identified in Germany in June, has some new mutations that help it spread, but vaccines should still prevent severe cases, experts say. The symptoms of XEC are the same as those of previous variants, including high fever, body aches, tiredness and fatigue, and a cough or sore throat. Doctors note that most people feel better within a few weeks of getting COVID-19, but it can take longer to recover. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the virus will likely climb again over the winter, peaking in mid-January.

**XEC: what you need to know about the new COVID variant**
A new COVID variant, XEC, is spreading rapidly and could become the dominant variant globally in the next few months. XEC is a recombinant variant, resulting from the exchange of genetic material between the KS.1.1 and KP.3.3 variants. It has a growth advantage over other circulating variants, but its prevalence is currently highest in Germany, where around 13% of sequences are potentially XEC. The variant's spread is being monitored, and while it is unclear if it causes worse disease, symptoms are expected to be similar to other COVID variants. The UK's autumn booster campaign will start in October, targeting the JN.1 variant, which XEC derives from, providing good protection against severe illness. XEC is the latest in a long list of COVID variants being monitored, and it may be outcompeted or replaced by a different but closely related variant in the future.

**New XEC COVID-19 variant expected to become the dominant strain soon. What we know**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, is expected to become the dominant strain soon, according to experts. XEC was first identified in Germany in June and has since been spotted in several countries, including the U.S., Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Canada, and the U.K. The variant is a rearrangement of the preexisting variants KP.3.3 and KS.1.1. While it has yet to be tracked by the CDC, at least 26 cases of XEC have been detected in the U.S. as of Sept. 3. Another variant, MV.1, is also growing in transmission and is expected to become a dominant strain. Experts remain cautious about both variants, but it may be weeks or months away from 'really taking hold.' In the meantime, public health officials are advising people to stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations, especially with the upcoming fall season. The FDA and WHO have announced vaccine guidance for the fall 2024 COVID-19 vaccine, which will target the JN.1 lineage viruses. Until the updated vaccine is released, the CDC recommends that adults 65 and older get an additional dose of the current COVID-19 vaccine, and children aged 6 months to 4 years old may need multiple doses to be up to date.

**New COVID-19 Variant XEC: What We Know So Far**
Experts have identified the next dominant COVID-19 variant, called XEC, which is a combination of the Omicron KS.1.1 and KP.3.3 lineages. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the variant is being closely monitored, but there is no concrete data on the number of cases in the US. Dr. Eric Topol stated that the variant is 'just beginning to start and expand' in the US and other parts of the world, and it may take several weeks or months for it to consolidate and cause a significant increase in cases. Dr. Marc Siegel, a medical analyst for Fox News, noted that XEC appears to be more contagious than recent variants, and common symptoms include congestion, cough, loss of smell and appetite, sore throat, and body aches. The FDA has approved new vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer for the 2024-2025 season, which are expected to offer at least some level of protection against XEC.

**New XEC COVID variant is on rise. What are its symptoms, and will it cause a surge?**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, is spreading rapidly in several countries, including Europe and North America. Experts predict that XEC could become the dominant strain in the US this fall. The variant is a recombinant of two previous variants, KP.3.3 and KS.1.1, and has at least one mutation in its spike protein. While it's unclear whether XEC will outcompete other variants, it's expected to be contagious and easily spread. The symptoms caused by XEC are similar to those caused by previous omicron variants, including fever, cough, and fatigue. The updated COVID-19 vaccine for 2024-2025 is available and recommended by the CDC for everyone ages six months and older, and is expected to provide protection against severe disease caused by XEC. Experts recommend getting vaccinated, especially for people at higher risk of developing severe disease, and taking steps to protect yourself from COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, such as testing if you have symptoms or an exposure, staying home if you're sick, and taking antivirals such as Paxlovid if prescribed.

**COVID variant XEC seeing rapid growth across globe and the U.S. Here's what to know**
The COVID-19 variant XEC is rapidly spreading across the globe and the U.S., and is expected to become the most contagious and dominant strain heading into the winter and flu season. XEC was first identified in Germany in June and has since spread to 27 countries. According to Dr. Marc Siegel, XEC causes congestion, cough, loss of smell and appetite, sore throat, and body aches. The symptoms of XEC are similar to those of prior COVID strains and the flu, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. The CDC recommends seeking medical attention if symptoms worsen or include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or pale, gray or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds. The new COVID vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer, approved for the 2024-2025 season, are expected to provide some protection against XEC, according to Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente Southern California.
