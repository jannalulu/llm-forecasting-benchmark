**North Shore ski hills opening this weekend**
Two ski hills on Vancouver's North Shore, Cypress Mountain Resort and Grouse Mountain, are opening this weekend. Cypress will open on Friday at 9 a.m. with limited terrain, including the Eagle Chair and Easy Rider lifts, while Grouse will open on Saturday at 9 a.m. with Paradise and Paradise Jib Park open via the Greenway Chair. According to Grant Wahl, Grouse Mountain's director of operations, 'Thanks to Mother Nature and the hard work of our grooming and snowmaking team, we’re ready to kick off another great winter season at The Peak of Vancouver.'

Grouse is also set to open its new gondola system this season, which will double their current upload and download capacity. Mt Seymour has yet to announce an opening date.

Aspen Mountain and Snowmass will open for the 2024-25 season on Saturday, November 23, five days ahead of their originally scheduled opening.

**Outdoors | Storm brings winter vibes to mountain resorts — what’s in store for ski season?**
The winter season is approaching for Southern California's mountain resorts, with some already open for snow tubing and others gearing up for the start of the ski season. Big Bear Mountain Resort is set to open mid-December with a new six-seat lift, called 'Midway,' which will replace two existing lifts. The resort is also planning a lift connection between Snow Summit and Bear Mountain, but this is still in the early stages. Mountain High in Wrightwood will be celebrating its 100th anniversary this season, with a day-long event on Dec. 7 featuring music, giveaways, and a costume contest. The resort nearly went up in flames in September's Bridge Fire, but is welcoming in the next 100 years. Road repairs are also underway on State Route 330 near Running Springs, with an estimated reopening date of Dec. 3. While La Nina weather conditions are predicted for this winter, which typically call for drier conditions, stats show that most years with this weather pattern have delivered plentiful, higher-than-average snowfall.

**Oregon ski resorts open early, but face an uncertain forecast this week**
Oregon ski resorts, including Timberline Resort, Mt. Hood Meadows, and Mt. Bachelor, have opened early this season due to abundant snowfall. However, an 'atmospheric river' is forecasted to bring heavy moisture and warmer temperatures to the region, potentially affecting snow conditions by next weekend. Forecasters predict up to 18 inches of snow on mountain passes and more at higher elevations, but warn that the system's path and duration are uncertain. A worst-case scenario could bring 7-12 inches of rain, while the best-case scenario would see 2-4 inches of snow. Greg Pack, president of Mt. Hood Meadows, expressed confidence in the resort's ability to handle the weather, saying, 'Not too worried about the weather,' and confirming plans to close after Sunday and reopen Thursday for seven-day operations.

**Prepping for opening day at Sugarbush, the Big Kicker and a new lift**
Sugarbush Resort is preparing for the 2024-2025 season with snowmaking, opening day, and the Big Kicker. Opening day is scheduled for Saturday, November 23, with the Big Kicker season opening celebration at Mount Ellen. The resort may open on Friday, November 22, with skiing at Lincoln Peak if the weather is cooperative. According to Sugarbush spokesperson John Bleh, the resort will focus on opening early season terrain, including Gate House and Valley House, before moving to upper mountain terrain around Heaven's Gate. The new Heaven's Gate Quad is under construction, with a projected opening date of early December, although this may be subject to change. Bleh said, 'The safest guess for opening Heaven's Gate terrain is early December. Though, there’s certainly a possibility that it ends up being a little bit earlier or a little bit later.'

**Here's when ski resorts in western WA are planning to open**
Ski resorts in western Washington are planning to open their doors for the 2024 ski season. Stevens Pass aims to open on December 6, but the actual opening day depends on the amount of snowfall.

Mission Ridge, Crystal Mountain, and The Summit at Snoqualmie have not yet announced their opening dates, but are expected to open around their 10-year average dates. According to FOX 13 Chief Meteorologist Brian MacMillan, snow levels will drop again early next week, bringing another chance for snow at the lower passes.

'Snow levels will rise sharply on Saturday, well above the passes.'

Mount Timothy Recreation Resort is optimistic about the upcoming winter season, with over six inches of snow already covering the area. General manager Launna Groves said, 'I think Mother Nature was having a temper tantrum last year,' and is hoping for twice as much snow this year. The resort never opened last year due to lack of snow, and staff had to look for other work. Groves said they are hiring and getting staffing organized for the season, and the ski patrol has already started training. The resort is also expanding its amenities, including a new pavilion with food, beverages, and washroom services, which is nearing completion. Groves said, 'We really encourage people to come up all year round now,' and the resort is transitioning into a four-season resort with activities such as hiking, bouncy castles, and mountain biking.

**Skiers in Greater Vancouver Eager for Winter Season**
Skiers in the Greater Vancouver area are eagerly awaiting the winter season, with meteorologists predicting a colder and wetter winter due to La Niña. Simon Whitehead, director of communications and marketing at Mount Seymour, says that people are preparing their bodies and equipment for the season. Levi Johnston, a technician at the Comor store in Vancouver, notes that the season has already begun, with snowfall starting to accumulate over the weekend. Johnston acknowledges that last season was challenging, but this time around, people are enthusiastic about the prospects. The U.S. National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center estimates a 60% chance of La Niña impacting the winter, leading to a colder and wetter climate. Simon Whitehead notes that sales of season passes at Seymour have been slower this fall, but have picked up since the recent predictions. The mountain hopes to open in mid-December. Cameras on the three local mountains are already showing snow on the slopes, with Whistler preparing to open in a few weeks. Diego Bastardo, an avid skier, has already found powder this year and is excited for the season. 'I'm super excited. We skied [on Saturday], we went for a hike at Seymour, and we built a rail and everything. It was so much fun.' Bastardo is eager to see more snow fall and is confident that it will be a great season.

Big White Ski Resort is exactly one month away from opening day, scheduled for Thursday, November 28. However, the resort's opening is contingent on sufficient snowfall over the next 31 days.

To secure a season pass, visitors can purchase one before November 28, when the price jumps from $1,129 to $1,999. Skiers and snowboarders are advised to 'wish for plenty of snow to fall at higher elevations' to ensure a timely opening.

**Ski season has officially started: First US ski resort is now open**
The 2024-2025 ski season has officially started with the opening of Ski Ward in Massachusetts on October 19, but it's not the first resort to offer a full mountain experience. Wolf Creek Ski Area in Colorado is the first larger resort to open with chairlift service seven days a week, on October 22, after receiving 26 inches of total snow. The early season is not beginner-friendly due to limited terrain, but many other resorts in the west are expected to open soon, with Keystone and Arapahoe Basin aiming to open sooner rather than later. Breckenridge, Brian Head, and Copper Mountain have announced an opening date of November 8, while Vail, Mammoth, Winter Park, and others plan to open by mid-November. On the East Coast, ski resorts are expected to open in mid-November or December. Season passes are now available, with prices ranging from $100 to $300 per day, and discounted ski days can be obtained through 'ski passport' programs for children in certain grades.
