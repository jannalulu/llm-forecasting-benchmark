**Key Central Valley races could shape who controls the House of Representatives**
Three close races in the Central Valley of California could determine which party controls the House of Representatives for the next two years. In the north, Republican Congressman John Duarte is leading Democrat Adam Gray with 48% of the expected vote reporting. Duarte said, 'I am the single most moderate Republican in Congress. I vote for my district. This is a swing district, and I vote my district and I stand up for immigration reform.' In the south, David Valadao is leading Democrat Rudy Salas with 52% of the expected vote. Meanwhile, in the 21st district, Congressman Jim Costa leads challenger Michael Maher by just about 1,000 votes, his tightest race in a decade. Maher said, 'I'm looking past party to solving the issues. For Fresno County, I fully expect that we're going to continue in a race that's only going to need to make up a couple thousand votes.'

**Here’s what we know about California 2024 General Election results so far**
California's General Election results are being processed and counted. Every registered voter was sent a mail-in ballot, which has delayed results due to the need for signature verification and handling late-arriving ballots. Vice President Kamala Harris won California's 54 electoral college votes, and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff won the U.S. Senate seat held by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Schiff also won the special election to fill the remainder of Feinstein's senate term. In the U.S. House of Representatives, Republican incumbent Rep. Kevin Kiley won Congressional District 3, and Democratic incumbent Ami Bera won Congressional District 6. In the California state Assembly, Democrat Maggie Krell is leading in the 6th Assembly District, and Republican incumbent Josh Hoover is leading in the 7th Assembly District. Democratic incumbent Stephanie Nguyen is leading in the 10th Assembly District.

**California Elections: Republicans Gain Ground in Key Districts**
The 2024 US elections have seen a shift in power, with the Republicans regaining control of the Senate and the Democrats facing a tough battle for control of the House of Representatives. In California, the Republicans have made gains in several key districts, including the 13th and 22nd congressional districts. In the 13th district, John Duarte, a Republican farmer, is leading his Democratic opponent Adam Gray by a narrow margin. In the 22nd district, David Valadao, a Republican farmer, is also leading his Democratic opponent Rudy Salas. The outcome of these races will determine the balance of power in the House of Representatives. Meanwhile, in the Senate, the Republican Michelle Steel is leading her Democratic opponent Derek Tran in the 45th district. The elections in California have been marked by a high turnout of voters, with over 9 million ballots cast so far. The results are still too close to call in several key races, and the outcome will depend on the remaining votes to be counted.

**Land of the million-dollar starter home could decide the fate of Congress**
The 2024 US congressional elections are being influenced by the housing crisis in California, with Democrats and Republicans vying for control of the House of Representatives. Will Rollins, a Democrat running against incumbent Republican Ken Calvert, has made housing a central theme in his campaign, proposing policies such as cracking down on corporations buying up housing stock and passing a tax credit for first-time homebuyers. Rollins' opponent, Calvert, has responded with his own housing-inflected messaging, warning that Rollins would 'rubber stamp' the failed policies of California Governor Gavin Newsom. The issue of housing costs has become a key concern for voters, with the median mortgage payment for new homes in the district increasing by 90% since 2019 and the median rent swelling by nearly 40%. Democrats have put more emphasis on housing supply, following in the footsteps of Vice President Kamala Harris, who has promised to build 3 million new units. Republicans, on the other hand, have focused on the threat of a rollback of Proposition 13, a voter-approved measure that limits reassessments on property taxes.

**One of California's closest elections could tilt House control. How to watch key debate**
Tonight's debate between Rep. John Duarte (R-Modesto) and former Assemblyman Adam Gray (D-Merced) could be the final showdown in one of California's closest House of Representatives elections. The two are vying for the 13th Congressional District, a tossup race that could help tilt House control toward Democrats or affirm Republicans' majority.

**California Congressional Candidates Debate in Race for Pivotal House Seat**
In a debate for California's 13th Congressional District, Rep. John Duarte (R-Calif.) and Democrat candidate Adam Gray discussed various issues, including energy policies, regulations, taxes, immigration, and more. Gray targeted what he said is an unproductive Congress that mismanaged the budget, calling for 'tough decisions about revenue and spending and a reversal of tax cuts enacted under former President Donald Trump.' Duarte said fiscal prudence is a foundation of his legislative decision making and challenged some of the climate-related agenda. On how best to lower gas prices, the candidates differed in their plans, with Duarte blaming the state's gas taxes and strict regulations, and Gray calling for more federal action. Both men said securing water for the agricultural region in the state's Central Valley is a top priority. They also agreed on supporting abortion rights and addressing housing costs. Duarte bested Gray by nearly 10 percent in the primary, but analysts are anticipating a close race in the general election.

**California Voters Could Decide Whether Republicans Keep The House**
California voters will decide the fate of several congressional seats in the upcoming election. Republicans are looking to hold onto their seats, while Democrats are vying to take control. Key races include the 13th District, where Rep. John Duarte (R-Calif.) is facing off against Democrat Adam Gray, and the 27th District, where Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.) is running against Democrat George Whitesides. Other notable races include the 40th District, where Rep. Young Kim (R-Calif.) is facing Democrat Joe Kerr, and the 42nd District, where Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.) is running against Democrat Will Rollins. Analysts forecast a tossup in the Riverside County race between Calvert and Rollins. Democrats are also looking to hold onto a seat representing coastal northern San Diego County, where Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) is facing a challenge from Republican Matt Gunderson. Additionally, Californians will decide who replaces the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein to fill the two-month remainder of her term in a special election held the same day as the vote to fill the next six-year term. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Republican Steve Garvey are vying for the position. 'It's time for a new leadership that brings Democrats, Republicans, and Independents together to end the chaos in Washington and deliver real results for Riverside County families,' Rollins said on his website. 'I'm running for Congress because politicians have created more problems than they've solved,' Whitesides said in a campaign video. 'I'll use my business experience to solve problems, instead of playing politics.'

**Map shows House seats most likely to flip in congressional elections**
The battle for control of the House of Representatives is heating up, with Democrats and Republicans neck and neck two weeks before the November 5 election. According to the Cook Political Report, there are 27 toss-up races, with 12 held by Democrats and 15 by Republicans. FiveThirtyEight's House forecast shows the race as a dead heat, with Democrats and Republicans winning their simulation 50 times each. Democrats could take back a slight majority by sweeping the competitive races in New York and California, two solidly Democratic states where Republicans outperformed expectations in 2022. In New York, there are five competitive races, including the 22nd Congressional District, where Republican Brandon Williams is facing a challenge from Democrat state Senator John Mannion. A poll conducted by GQR showed Mannion with a 7-point lead, 50 percent to 43 percent. In California, there are five toss-up seats currently held by Republicans and two seats classified as 'Lean Democrat.' Democrat Adam Gray is challenging Representative John Duarte in a Central Valley-based seat, a rematch of the race two years ago, in California's 13th District. Independent polls are showing tight races in some districts where Republicans are favored, including Virginia's 2nd District, where Republican Representative Jen Kiggans is leading Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal by one point, and New Jersey's 7th District, where Republican Representative Tom Kean is leading Democrat Sue Altman by two points.

**California's Voters May Determine the Balance of Power in Congress**
California's voters may determine the balance of power in Congress in November, with 52 competitive House of Representatives seats up for grabs. The Republicans currently control the House with a slim majority of eight seats, thanks in part to the 2022 elections, where some California seats changed from blue to red. In the Central Valley, Orange County, and East Los Angeles, the most competitive districts are located. Among the 10 most competitive districts, the Republicans hold seven seats. In the 13th district, Representative John Duarte (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Adam Gray in a rematch of the 2022 election. Duarte won the district for the first time since 1974, with a margin of less than 600 votes. In the 22nd district, Representative David Valadao (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Rudy Salas in the San Joaquin Valley, a region known for its agricultural production. In the 27th district, Representative Mike García (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat George Whitesides, a former NASA administrator. In the 45th district, Representative Michelle Steel (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Derek Tran, a veteran, entrepreneur, and consumer rights lawyer. In the 47th district, the news is still developing. The candidates are vying for the support of voters in the north of Los Angeles County, including the cities of Lancaster, Palmdale, and Santa Clarita, as well as parts of Los Angeles. Steel, a Korean immigrant, has been a strong advocate for reducing taxes and spending, while Tran has emphasized the need to protect the rights of consumers and workers. 'I am in touch with the problems of the district and have a lot of credibility with a lot of people,' Duarte said. 'The message is clear: bring water to farms, drill American oil, and control the cost of living.' 'I am running for Congress because politicians have created more problems than they have solved,' Whitesides said. 'I will use my business experience to solve problems, not play politics.' 'My parents were refugees who worked hard and sacrificed so that I could achieve the American dream,' Tran said. 'I enlisted in the Army to repay the country for what it has given me, and I am running for Congress to put people ahead of politics, protect our democracy, and ensure that everyone, regardless of where they come from, has the opportunity to succeed without fear of having their freedoms taken away.'

**US Congressional Elections: The Fateful 13th District**
The Democrats need to win only four seats to regain control of the House of Representatives from the Republicans. The 13th Congressional District in California is a key battleground, where Republican John Duarte and Democrat Adam Gray are vying for the seat. Duarte, a farmer, won the seat in 2022 by a narrow margin of 564 votes, despite being in a district that should be a Democratic stronghold, with two-thirds of the population being Latino. Gray, also a farmer, is now a construction company employee. The district is located in the San Joaquin Valley, a region known for its vineyards and almond trees, southeast of San Francisco. As Gray said, 'It's a district that should be a Democratic stronghold, but it's not.'

**John Duarte, Adam Gray face off in a congressional rematch**
The 2022 midterm election was a close race between Adam Gray, a Democrat, and John Duarte, a Republican, for California's 13th Congressional District. The rematch is now underway, with Gray and Duarte facing off again. Gray, a radical centrist, emphasizes the importance of working together and putting community first. His top priorities include expanding access to healthcare, water, agriculture, and education. Duarte, who has run his own nursery business, says his experience has helped him understand issues impacting the valley. He emphasizes the need to address inflation and water infrastructure projects, and opposes the current border bill due to a specific clause. Gray blames Republicans for stepping away from a bipartisan deal on the border and immigration. The outcome of this election could determine the balance of power in the United States House of Representatives.

As the November 5 election approaches, top leaders from both parties have made in-person appearances in Congressional District 13 to support their respective candidates. California Senate candidate Rep. Adam Schiff met with Democrat Adam Gray, who is running in a tight race against incumbent District 13 Rep. John Duarte. Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson appeared in Modesto with Rep. Vince Fong to galvanize Republican support behind Duarte. Schiff and Johnson both posted about their visits on their social media accounts, highlighting the importance of the 13th Congressional District in the battle for House majority. The district is a key battleground, with Republicans holding 220 House seats to the Democrats' 212, and a win for Duarte or Gray will be crucial in gaining or retaining power. The two candidates will face off in a debate on October 25 at the State Theatre in Modesto, which will be broadcast live on local radio stations.

**Democrats try to link Central Valley House Republican to Project 2025. Is it fair?**
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has placed a billboard in California Congressional District 13, attempting to link House Republican John Duarte to the controversial 'Project 2025' created by the Heritage Foundation. Duarte responded, 'I have not read and I do not endorse Project 2025.' However, the DCCC argues that Duarte's voting record aligns with the project's agenda. According to the Heritage Foundation's scorecard, Duarte has a 41% score, which is notably low but not the lowest among Republicans. Dan Gottlieb, a spokesperson for the DCCC, stated, 'It's hard to separate yourself from an agenda that you vote with time and time again.' Duarte has confirmed that he will certify the 2024 election, despite concerns raised by the House Accountability War Room.

**Turnout has been key to Central Valley tossup House races. What experts expect in 2024**
The 2024 congressional races in California's Central Valley could be decided by turnout, particularly among young and Latino voters. Experts expect higher turnout due to the competitiveness and presidential election. However, changing demographics and party affiliations may affect the outcome. College-educated voters are moving to Democrats, while non-college-educated voters are shifting to Republicans. Latinos are also showing a rightward shift. The 13th and 22nd Congressional Districts have high populations of non-college-educated voters and a growing no-party-preference bloc. To win, campaigns need to actively reach out to key issues and earn the votes of Latino voters, who lack trust in either party. 'It's really about the composition of the population in these districts that's driving the change,' said Eric McGhee, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. 'Their votes need to be earned,' added Pablo Rodriguez, founding Executive Director of Communities for a New California Education Fund.

**In a 'purple' California district, a GOP congressman fights to defend a seat he won by 564 votes**
Rep. John Duarte (R-Modesto) is facing a tough reelection battle in California's Congressional District 13, a 'purple' district that leans Democratic. Duarte, a moderate Republican, has broken ranks with his party on issues such as abortion and immigration, and has expressed support for a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients. His opponent, former state Assemblymember Adam Gray, describes himself as a centrist who worked across the aisle to pass bipartisan legislation. Gray has secured funding for water storage projects and a medical school at UC Merced, and has bucked his own party on water conservation issues. Voters in the district are concerned about the cost of living and housing, and are frustrated with partisan politics. Duarte has stressed his personal experience as a farmer and his understanding of the burdens of environmental regulations on farming. He has also spoken about working with local mayors to ensure access to 'abundant, reliable, affordable' surface water. The two candidates will debate on October 25 in Modesto, and a recent poll found that Gray holds a 2-point lead over Duarte.

**Central Valley Democrats slightly lead Republican incumbents in new tossup House race polls**
In a recent poll, Democratic challengers are narrowly leading Republican incumbents in two highly competitive San Joaquin Valley congressional races. The polls, conducted in California's 13th and 22nd Congressional Districts, show that turnout will be key to who wins in November. In the 22nd district, former Assemblyman Rudy Salas, D-Bakersfield, led Rep. David Valadao, R-Hanford, by 4.2 percentage points. In the 13th district, former Assemblyman Adam Gray, D-Merced, led freshman Rep. John Duarte, R-Modesto, by 2 percentage points. The polls also showed that new voters in these districts tend to favor the Democratic challengers, while undecided voters slightly favor the GOP incumbents. These districts are crucial to deciding who wins control of the House, and Democrats would need to flip four seats nationwide to gain a majority.

**These 10 California elections will help determine US House control. What to know**
California has several competitive U.S. House of Representatives races that will help determine control of the chamber. Democrats need to flip four seats nationwide to gain control. The 13th and 22nd Congressional Districts in the Central Valley, along with several others in Southern California, are highly anticipated. Analysts rate some races as 'likely' for the incumbent, while others are 'tossups' or 'tilts' for either party. The Cook Political Report, Inside Elections, and Sabato's Crystal Ball rate districts on a scale from 'likely' to 'tossup' for either party. The 10 California congressional races to watch include: Likely Republican: Rep. Kevin Kiley vs. Jessica Morse; Likely Democratic: Rep. Josh Harder vs. Kevin Lincoln; Tossup: Rep. John Duarte vs. Adam Gray; Tossup: Rep. David Valadao vs. Rudy Salas; Likely Republican: Rep. Mike Garcia vs. George Whitesides; Likely Republican: Rep. Young Kim vs. Joe Kerr; Tossup: Rep. Ken Calvert vs. Will Rollins; Leans Republican: Rep. Michelle Steel vs. Derek Tran; Leans Democratic: Rep. Katie Porter's successor, Scott Baugh vs. Dave Min; Tossup: Rep.

**Democrats look to flip 'toss-up' California district in bid for House control - Washington Examiner**
A competitive congressional race in California's 13th District could be key to helping Democrats regain control of the House. Former Democratic Assemblyman Adam Gray is running against Rep. John Duarte (R-CA), who won the seat by under 600 votes two years ago. Political analysts view Duarte as vulnerable due to his narrow margin of victory and status as a first-term congressman. 'Anything that's good for Democrats is going to have an outsized effect on Duarte simply because he's the less-tested candidate,' said Jacob Rubashkin, a deputy editor of Inside Elections. Erin Covey, a House analyst and editor at the Cook Political Report, added that Duarte 'can also be more easily roped into the national Republican Party because he hasn't had as much time to show voters that he's not like other Republicans.' Pundits rate the race as a toss-up, with some predicting a single-digit gain for either party. 'In this particular election, the factors are beyond anybody's control,' said Mike Lynch, a longtime Democratic strategist and former chief of staff to Gray. 'It's a coin-toss difference.'

**Democrats look to flip ‘toss-up' California district in bid for House control**
The California 13th Congressional District is a key battleground in the fight for control of the House. Former Democratic Assemblyman Adam Gray is running against incumbent Rep. John Duarte (R-CA) in a rematch of their 2022 race. Duarte won by a narrow margin of under 600 votes, but analysts say his status as a first-term congressman makes him vulnerable. 'Anything that's good for Democrats is going to have an outsized effect on Duarte simply because he's the less-tested candidate,' said Jacob Rubashkin, a deputy editor of Inside Elections. Erin Covey, a House analyst, added that Duarte 'can also be more easily roped into the national Republican Party because he hasn't had as much time to show voters that he's not like other Republicans.' The National Republican Congressional Committee has urged members to focus on defensive fundraising efforts, but the Democratic Party's recent fundraising surge, fueled by Vice President Kamala Harris, has made the GOP's task more challenging. Pundits rate the race as a toss-up, with some predicting a single-digit gain for either party. 'In this particular election, the factors are beyond anybody's control,' said Mike Lynch, a longtime Democratic strategist. 'It's a coin-toss difference.'

**John Duarte vs. Adam Gray for Congress: Why experts are watching this California election**
The 2024 rematch election between freshman Rep. John Duarte, R-Modesto, and former Assemblyman Adam Gray, D-Merced, in California's 13th Congressional District is a tossup, according to nonpartisan analysts. Gray lost to Duarte by 564 votes in 2022, and analysts say Duarte will have a tougher time in November due to being a first-term congressman. Gray has fundraised well against Duarte recently, but the Republican retains an edge in overall funds. The district is a Latino-majority voting-age district with a large population of young people, and legislative issues concern affordability, water access, health, immigration, and public safety. Gray emphasized the need for Congress to invest in water infrastructure and renewable energy, while Duarte emphasized the importance of drilling American oil and developing natural gas. 'Congress can make investments in water infrastructure,' Gray said. 'Congress can make investments in renewable energy and new opportunities to take advantage of the biocircular economy here in the Valley.' Duarte said, 'We've got to drill American oil. We've got to continue to develop natural gas and welcome it as a key energy resource for the future.'
