**Trump turns to Congress for Cabinet picks, whittling away at slim margins**
President-elect Donald Trump has selected five Republican members of Congress to join his administration, potentially narrowing the majorities his party will hold in the Senate and House of Representatives. Trump's nominees, including Senator Marco Rubio, Representative Elise Stefanik, and Representative Michael Waltz, will need Senate confirmation before taking office. If confirmed, they will resign from their seats, which will remain vacant until special elections are held in 2026. Representative Matt Gaetz, another Trump nominee, will also need Senate confirmation, and his seat will be filled by a special election if he is confirmed. Trump's running-mate JD Vance will resign his Senate seat before taking office as vice president, and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine will appoint a temporary replacement until a special election is held in 2026.

**Ramaswamy won‘t seek Vance’s Senate seat after Trump appointment**
Vivek Ramaswamy has withdrawn himself from consideration for the U.S. Senate seat in Ohio, which was vacated by Vice President-elect JD Vance. Ramaswamy was previously interested in filling the vacancy, but was appointed by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency, along with Elon Musk. Ramaswamy said, 'I'm withdrawing myself from consideration for the pending Senate appointment in Ohio. Whoever Governor DeWine appoints to JD's seat has some big shoes to fill. I will help them however I can.' The appointment will not automatically serve out the remainder of Vance's term, which runs through 2028, and Ohio voters will select the person in a special election in 2026. Ramaswamy could still run for governor in 2026 or challenge the appointee in the Republican primary election.

**Experts weigh in as speculation over Vance's Ohio Senate seat grows**
J.D. Vance is expected to resign from his Ohio Senate seat within the next two months to take on a role in the vice presidency. According to Ohio Revised Code, Governor Mike DeWine has the authority to appoint a replacement. Ryan Stubenrauch, a former assistant attorney general under DeWine, believes the list of potential replacements is short and mentions Jane Timken, Frank LaRose, and Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted as possible finalists. Stubenrauch notes that DeWine will likely choose someone who can win re-election and has ties to Donald Trump and the donor class in Ohio. 'I think someone like Jane Timkin makes the most sense,' Stubenrauch said. 'She has the unique experience of someone who has actually run in a senate primary before, somebody who has worked closely with Donald Trump as both Ohio Republican chair and as an RNC member.'

**Who Will Replace JD Vance in the Senate? Top Contenders Emerge**
After JD Vance's election as Vice President, he will have to resign from his Senate seat. According to Ohio state law, Governor Mike DeWine will temporarily appoint his successor. Vance has four years left in his term, and DeWine will choose someone who can win both a primary and a general election. DeWine said, 'We need someone who really focuses on the state of Ohio, who focuses on national issues, someone who really works hard, someone who wants to do things. I think these qualifications are very important. Also, they have to be someone who can win a primary. They have to be someone who can win a general election and, two years later, do it all again. So it's not for the faint of heart.' Several candidates are being considered, including Vivek Ramaswamy, a 39-year-old entrepreneur who ran for president in 2024, Matt Dolan, a state senator and owner of the Cleveland Guardians, and Jane Timken, a Harvard-educated lawyer and former chair of the Ohio Republican Party. Frank LaRose, the local Secretary of State, also lost the Republican primary for the Senate seat. Other potential candidates include Dave Yost, the Attorney General, and Jon Husted, the Vice Governor.

**Ohio Governor Mike DeWine to Choose Successor for Senator J.D. Vance**
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine will choose a successor for Senator J.D. Vance, who will resign due to his election as Vice President. DeWine, a traditional Republican, has received criticism from President-elect Donald Trump and has had disagreements with him on several occasions. Although no official candidates have been announced, reports suggest that Vivek Ramaswamy, a 39-year-old biotechnology entrepreneur, Matt Dolan, a state senator, Jon Husted, the Vice Governor of Ohio, Dave Yost, the Attorney General, Frank LaRose, the Secretary of State, and Jane Timken, the former President of the Ohio Republican Party, are potential candidates. DeWine stated, 'We need someone who can do a good job in the Senate. I think I have a pretty clear idea of what is required.' He added, 'This is not a position for the faint of heart. It's not for someone who just wants to occupy a seat. It must be someone who really wants to do the work and has the ability to do it.' DeWine also mentioned that 'many people are calling. We are just starting to analyze this and determine who would be the best option.' An Ohio Republican strategist stated, 'I think it comes down to three people: Vivek Ramaswamy, Jon Husted, and Dave Yost.' 'Vivek Ramaswamy has all the advantages,' he added. Ramaswamy, a biotechnology entrepreneur, has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the Senate seat and has expressed interest in joining the Trump administration. He stated, 'I want to have the greatest impact possible in this country.' Timken, a 58-year-old former President of the Ohio Republican Party, has also been mentioned as a potential candidate. She has been praised for her ability to unite different factions of the Republican Party in Ohio. Dolan, LaRose, and Yost have also been mentioned as potential candidates. DeWine will choose a Republican to fill the Senate seat until a special election in 2026, when a new senator will be elected to complete the remainder of Vance's term, which ends in 2028.

**Ohio Gov. DeWine Begins Process of Selecting Vance's Senate Replacement**
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine is tasked with selecting a replacement for Senator JD Vance, who is stepping down to become Vice President-elect.

The contenders for the post include Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur, State Senator Matt Dolan, Ohio Lt. Governor Jon Husted, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, and former Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken. DeWine said, 'It has to be someone who will serve well in the Senate. I think I have a pretty good idea of what it takes.' He added, 'This is not for the faint-hearted, this is not for someone who just wants to get a seat. This has to be someone who really wants to do the job and do the work, and who we think has the ability to do that.'

**Ohio Republican Sen. Matt Dolan seeking appointment to fill vacancy left by VP-elect JD Vance**
Ohio Republican Sen. Matt Dolan is seeking the appointment to the U.S Senate seat being vacated by Vice President-Elect JD Vance. Dolan stated, 'I still have the fire in the belly to serve Ohioans, and I think I can do a good job in the U.S. Senate to help our country and our state move forward.' He previously ran in the Republican primary and came in second, with Gov. Mike DeWine's endorsement. However, Dolan did not seek President-Elect Donald Trump's endorsement, and it remains to be seen whether Trump will support him. Other potential candidates on DeWine's list include Secretary of State Frank LaRose, former Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken, and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost has ruled out the appointment, stating, 'I would not accept that appointment.'

**David Trinko: Who wants JD Vance’s old job?**
After JD Vance's appointment as Vice President, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine will have to decide who to appoint to fill his Senate seat until the 2026 election. Several area Republicans, including Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman and U.S. Rep. Bob Latta, have expressed no interest in becoming a senator. Huffman said, 'I have a chance of being the (state) Speaker of the House next year. That's a better, more important position than U.S. Senator, from my perspective.' Latta stated, 'I'm running to be chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee. All of my efforts are into that, so I don't have an interest in running for the Senate or being appointed to the Senate.' Potential candidates to replace Vance include Bernie Moreno, a former car dealer, and former Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken. Whoever DeWine chooses should be someone who will 'represent the state of Ohio,' Latta said.

**Who DeWine Picks as Vance’s Replacement of Crucial Interest to Gun Owners**
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine will soon appoint a replacement for JD Vance in the U.S. Senate, and gun owners are closely watching who he will choose. DeWine has a history of supporting gun control measures, but some potential candidates have strong Second Amendment records. Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican primary presidential candidate, is a 'Second Amendment absolutist' who has been endorsed by JD Vance. Jane Timken has pledged to fight for gun owners' Constitutional right to bear arms, while Matt Dolan supports a host of gun prohibitions. Frank LaRose has a 100% score from Buckeye Firearms Association PAC and has been endorsed by the group. Robert Sprague has a perfect 13-0 voting record on gun rights issues and was a Constitutional Carry bill co-sponsor. Dave Joyce has an A grade from the NRA, but has also supported Democrats on gun control measures. Mike Carey has asserted that the Constitution is absolute and the right to bear arms shall not be infringed, but has also supported stricter gun regulations. Gun owners are urging DeWine to choose a candidate who will protect their interests.

**How DeWine will choose Vance’s replacement to represent Ohio in U.S. Senate after VP election**
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine will appoint a replacement for U.S. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, who was elected vice president. The timeline for the appointment is driven by when Vance chooses to step down, but DeWine anticipates Vance may leave the job sooner. According to Dan Tierney, press secretary for DeWine, the governor will follow a similar process to when he appointed Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters to fill a vacancy on the Ohio Supreme Court. This includes hearing from interested individuals, creating a shortlist, and vetting candidates privately before announcing the decision publicly. Tierney stated that DeWine will look for someone who is qualified, represents the state well, and has a strong chance of being ratified by voters. Additionally, as a former U.S. senator, DeWine will also consider the candidate's ability to work through the committee process, focus on legislation, and work across the aisle. Potential contenders include state Sen. Matt Dolan, Secretary of State Frank LaRose, and former GOP state party Chair Jane Timken, among others.

Potential replacements include Matt Dolan, Sec. of State Frank LaRose, U.S. Rep. Mike Carey, Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, and Attorney General Dave Yost, all of whom are Republicans. According to DeWine, Dolan is 'probably high up on the list' for the appointment, given his endorsement during the 2024 GOP primary. However, LaRose has faced criticism for his handling of the SOS office and ballot language. Carey has been linked to discussions as Vance's potential replacement, while Husted and Yost are considered likely candidates for the 2026 Ohio governor's race, but may consider the U.S. Senate seat instead.

Ohio Governor Mike DeWine is reportedly considering appointing State Senator Matt Dolan to fill the Senate seat of J.D. Vance, assuming he is elected vice president. However, this move is met with outrage from MAGA Republicans and conservatives, who view Dolan as an 'establishment Republican.' DeWine has stated that the appointee must be able to raise money for a primary in 2026 and the special election, as well as the election for a full term in 2028. Potential candidates include Republican U.S. Representatives David Joyce and Mike Carey, as well as former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who is a close friend of Vance and his wife. Democrats are likely to mount a strong special election campaign, with former Representative Tim Ryan considered their 'best bet.'
