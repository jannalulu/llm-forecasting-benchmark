**Africa CDC Urges US to Reassess Rwanda Travel Advisory Amid Marburg Virus Success | Health**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has urged the US to reassess the Level 3 travel advisory for Rwanda due to the Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) outbreak. The advisory, issued on October 7, 2024, no longer reflects the current epidemiological situation in Rwanda, where significant progress has been made in containing the outbreak. Rwanda has gone 18 days without reporting a new MVD case, with all previous patients discharged and a 100% completion rate of contact monitoring. Dr. Jean Kaseya, Africa CDC Director General, stated, 'Revising the advisory would not only recognize Rwanda's public health achievements but also bolster its efforts to rebuild its economy.' Dr. Sabin Nsanzimana, Rwanda's Minister of Health, emphasized vigilance despite progress, saying, 'More than a month without a death from Marburg is indicative of the sound progress we have made, but the country remains vigilant.' Evaluations from Africa CDC and WHO confirm that the risk of further transmission is low, with no recorded cases outside Rwanda or in the United States.

**Africa CDC urges U.S. to reassess travel advisory on Rwanda**
The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has urged the United States to reassess its Level 3 travel advisory for Rwanda, citing the country's progress in managing and containing the Marburg virus disease outbreak. According to Africa CDC Director-General Jean Kaseya, recent evaluations by Africa CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) confirm that the risk of further transmission is low, with no reported cases outside Rwanda or in the United States. The Africa CDC noted that the travel advisory has had a substantial impact on Rwanda's tourism and business sectors, and urged the U.S. to update the advisory to reflect the current epidemiological context, recognizing Rwanda's public health achievements and supporting its economic recovery. As of Sunday, it had been 18 days since Rwanda reported its last case of Marburg virus disease, with all previously infected patients successfully discharged and robust monitoring and community follow-up systems in place.

**California patient first in US to be infected with fatal mpox strain**
A patient in California has become the first in the US to be infected with the fatal Clade I mpox strain, which has a fatality rate of up to one in 10 people it infects. The patient, who recently returned to the US from East Africa, has been discharged from the hospital and is isolating at home. Officials say the risk to the public is 'low', as the disease only spreads through direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated items. Scientists expect the patient to make a full recovery. The Clade I strain is more severe than the Clade II type, which has a fatality rate of less than three percent and has killed 63 Americans since the 2022 outbreak.

**US confirms first case of more aggressive mpox strain**
US health officials have confirmed the first case of a more severe strain of mpox, known as clade I, in an individual who recently traveled to Africa. The person, treated in San Mateo County, is recovering at home. According to California's health department, 'there is no concern or evidence that mpox clade I is currently spreading between individuals in California or the United States.' The World Health Organization (WHO) will convene on November 22 to determine if the outbreak in Africa still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. The risk of clade I mpox to the general public in the U.S. remains low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

**Disease Outbreak News: Marburg virus disease - Rwanda, 13 November 2024 - Rwanda**
The Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak in Rwanda has seen 66 confirmed cases, including 15 deaths, with a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 23%. The country has reported no new confirmed cases since October 30, 2024. The 42-day countdown to declare the end of the outbreak has commenced, with no new infections arising during this period required for the outbreak to be declared over. The source of the outbreak is reported to be of zoonotic origin, linked to exposure in a cave inhabited by fruit bats. MVD is a highly virulent disease that can cause severe disease and is clinically similar to Ebola virus disease. There is currently no approved treatment or vaccine for MVD, with some candidate vaccines and therapeutics under investigation. WHO continues to support the Government of Rwanda in responding to the outbreak, with enhanced surveillance and infection prevention and control measures in place until the outbreak is declared over. 'The 42-day countdown period is twice the maximum incubation period for Marburg virus infections, since the last potential exposure to the last reported case,' said the World Health Organization. 'All listed contacts will continue to be followed up until the end of their 21-day observation period.'

**Rwanda: Marburg Virus Disease**
As of 8 November 2024, 66 confirmed cases of Marburg virus disease (MVD) have been reported in Rwanda, including 15 deaths with a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 23%. The country has reported no new confirmed cases since 30 October 2024. The WHO continues to support the Government of Rwanda in responding to the outbreak. Enhanced surveillance and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures must be maintained until the outbreak is declared over. The 42-day countdown to declare the end of the outbreak commenced on 9 November 2024, the day after the last confirmed patient tested negative for MVD by PCR. According to the WHO, 'the outbreak will only be declared over if no new infections arise during the 42-day countdown.'

**Large Marburg Virus Disease Outbreak in the Republic of Rwanda**
The Republic of Rwanda has confirmed its first outbreak of Marburg virus disease (MVD), a rare but highly fatal viral hemorrhagic fever. As of October 17, there have been 62 laboratory-confirmed cases and 15 deaths, making this the third largest MVD outbreak recorded. The CDC emphasizes that MVD is not spread through airborne transmission but rather through direct contact with bodily fluids of those sick with the disease. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, gastrointestinal symptoms, or unexplained bleeding. Currently, there is no approved vaccine or specific treatment for MVD beyond supportive care. The CDC recommends isolating symptomatic patients with exposure risks until receiving a negative test result on a sample collected 72 hours or more after symptom onset.

**Rwanda's Marburg Virus Epidemic Under Control, But Risks Remain**
The Marburg virus epidemic in Rwanda is under control, according to Jean Kaseya, the director general of the Africa CDC. Since the outbreak was declared on September 28, 13 deaths and 58 cases have been reported. The US has advised its citizens against traveling to Rwanda due to the risk of the disease. The Marburg virus is a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever, with a mortality rate of up to 88%. There is currently no approved treatment or vaccine for the disease. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, and the disease can be spread through prolonged exposure to infected bats. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the disease is a significant threat to global health. The WHO has explained that patients with the disease must receive treatment in a specialized healthcare facility and wait for laboratory test results before they can return home safely. The disease is characterized by a sudden onset of symptoms, including a 'ghost-like' appearance, with sunken eyes, a pale face, and extreme lethargy. The disease can be fatal within 8-9 days of symptom onset, preceded by significant bleeding. A vaccination campaign has begun in Rwanda, with 700 doses of a vaccine being distributed to high-risk populations, including healthcare workers. The vaccine is being tested in a clinical trial, and has already undergone phase 2 testing in Uganda and Kenya.

**Marburg outbreak tied to Rwanda hospital; US risk is low**
Rwanda has confirmed 61 cases of Marburg virus infections and 14 deaths as of October 13. The outbreak, first reported on September 27, is contained within a hospital cluster in Kigali, with no evidence of community transmission. The disease causes severe symptoms, including headaches, muscle aches, and unexplained bleeding. Although the risk of Marburg appearing in the U.S. is low, the CDC recommends clinicians assess the possibility of the viral hemorrhagic fever in patients who present symptoms or have been in contact with an infected person or have been to an area with a current outbreak in the last 21 days, as stated by the Ministry of Health, 'Symptoms can appear two to 21 days after infection.'

**CDC Issues Travel Alert for Rwanda Due to Marburg Virus Outbreak**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a travel alert for Rwanda due to an outbreak of the Marburg virus, a disease similar to Ebola. The CDC raised its travel alert level to 3 on October 7, advising people to reconsider non-essential travel to the country. The alert applies to all of Rwanda, as cases of Marburg have been confirmed in several areas of the country. For people who 'must' travel to Rwanda, the CDC advises travelers to 'avoid contact with sick people who show symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, and skin rash,' and to 'avoid traditional healers' and 'avoid contact with blood and other bodily fluids.' The CDC also advises people to 'avoid visiting hospitals in the outbreak area for non-urgent medical care or non-medical reasons,' and to 'avoid contact with corpses or items that have been in contact with corpses, participate in funeral or burial rituals, or attend a funeral or burial.' The CDC has also announced that it will begin screening travelers who have been in Rwanda in the last 21 days, starting on October 14. This measure aims to reduce the risk of importing cases of Marburg to the US and its spread within US communities. The Rwandan Ministry of Health has also been screening travelers leaving the country to detect the virus. As of October 9, there have been 58 cases and 13 deaths reported in Rwanda, with a fatality rate of 88%. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) states that the average fatality rate of the disease is 50%. The virus is transmitted to humans by fruit bats and then spreads through contact with the bodily fluids of infected people. There are no approved vaccines or treatments for Marburg in the US, while the Rwandan Minister of Health has said that several promising candidates may soon be tested. The Sabin Vaccine Institute, a non-profit organization, is collaborating with Rwandan authorities on the outbreak, and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative is also involved. A team that developed the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine at the University of Oxford has begun a trial of a Marburg vaccine candidate in the UK using similar technology. Meanwhile, Rwandan authorities are monitoring around 300 contacts of known cases. Approximately 70% of confirmed cases are healthcare workers from two hospitals in the capital, Kigali, although cases have been reported in seven of the country's 30 districts. In addition to spreading in healthcare settings, the disease can also spread at funerals, where physical contact with the deceased is common in some cultures, said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia.

**Rwanda's Marburg Virus Outbreak: 80% of Cases are Healthcare Professionals**
According to the Minister of Health of Rwanda, Sabin Nsanzimana, around 80% of the 36 confirmed cases of the Marburg virus in the country are healthcare professionals. 'It's a very characteristic feature of outbreaks because many of them proliferate in medical facilities (...). They are the first to be affected by these viruses because they treat sick people in different contexts,' Nsanzimana explained in a joint online press conference with the Director of the African Union's health agency, Jean Kaseya. Rwanda has reported 36 cases and 11 deaths from Marburg since announcing the outbreak last Friday, Nsanzimana recalled, celebrating that five patients tested negative for the virus on Wednesday. 'We will do a second test in a few days to confirm it,' Nsanzimana said. Since the first case was confirmed in a patient admitted to a hospital in Kigali and who has since died, Rwandan health authorities have tracked over 400 contacts who have tested negative for the virus or show no symptoms. 'We will stop this outbreak before it affects other parts of the country or beyond,' Nsanzimana assured. Kaseya called on CDC Africa partners to support Rwanda, saying '(the Marburg virus) can quickly become a regional and continental problem (...). We don't want another outbreak,' he said, referring to the mpox outbreak, which has 34,297 cases (6,806 confirmed) and 866 deaths since the beginning of 2024 in 16 African Union member states, including Rwanda, the only country to have started vaccination against this virus. Rwanda will soon begin clinical trials of vaccines and treatments to address the outbreak, as there is currently no proven vaccine or specific treatment. This is the first time the Marburg virus has been detected in Rwanda, a highly infectious viral hemorrhagic fever of the same family as Ebola. Africa was the scene of two Ebola outbreaks last year: one in Equatorial Guinea, which caused 17 confirmed cases, including 12 deaths; and another in Tanzania, with at least nine cases (eight confirmed and one probable) and six deaths. Before that, there were cases in other countries such as Ghana, Guinea-Conakri, Uganda, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya and South Africa. To prevent its spread, authorities have recommended reinforcing hygiene and avoiding close contact with people showing symptoms of the disease, which include high fever, severe headaches, muscle pains, vomiting and diarrhea. This disease is as deadly as Ebola and is estimated to have killed over 3,500 people in Africa. Like Ebola, the Marburg virus causes sudden hemorrhages and can cause death in a few days, with an incubation period of 2 to 21 days and a mortality rate of up to 88%. Fruit bats are the natural hosts of this virus, which when transmitted to humans can be transmitted through direct contact with fluids such as blood, saliva, vomit or urine. The disease was detected in 1967 in the German city of Marburg - the origin of its name - by laboratory technicians who became infected when investigating monkeys brought from Uganda.

**Marburg Virus Suspicions in Hamburg Not Confirmed**
The suspicion of Marburg virus in two people in Hamburg has not been confirmed. The tests were negative, according to the Social Authority. One of the two individuals had recently worked in a hospital in Rwanda, where people infected with the virus were being treated. Both individuals will continue to be monitored. The medical student with contact to an infected person will be observed until the end of the incubation period of up to 21 days. He will be isolated in a special area of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) for the next few days, followed by home isolation under the supervision of the responsible health authority. The companion will also be observed at the UKE over the weekend. There was no risk to fellow travelers during the return journey from Rwanda via Frankfurt to Hamburg by train and plane. The Marburg virus is not airborne, like COVID-19 or influenza viruses, but is transmitted through close contact with severely ill people or their bodily fluids, as stated by the Robert Koch Institute. Normal encounters with people in public and private spaces do not pose a risk. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Marburg virus causes high fever and symptoms such as muscle pain, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and bloody vomiting. In previous outbreaks in Africa, 25-90% of those infected died. Since 1967, there have been no cases of the disease in Germany, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The virus is named after the German city of Marburg, where laboratory staff became infected with the virus in 1967 while working with infected monkeys. As a precaution, the two individuals in Hamburg have been in contact with doctors since their return from Rwanda.

**Marburg Virus Outbreak in Rwanda: A Concern for Healthcare Workers**
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been no outbreaks of the Marburg virus in Germany since 1967. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids of infected individuals, such as blood, and not through the air. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days. The Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNITM) states that the Egyptian fruit bat is a reservoir and transmitter of the Marburg virus. Recently, an outbreak of Marburg fever occurred in Rwanda, resulting in the deaths of 10 patients, with 29 cases confirmed as of October 1, according to Health Minister Sabin Nsanzimana. The 19 current patients, mostly medical staff, are isolated. Tropenmediziner Maximilian Gertler from the Berlin Charité notes that it is not surprising that healthcare workers are primarily affected, as the infection starts with non-specific symptoms that can be mistaken for malaria or a flu-like illness. 'The perfidious thing about the infection is that it starts with very non-specific symptoms, such as those that can also be caused by malaria or a flu-like illness,' Gertler says. 'When dealing with these diseases, one is always tempted to quickly take blood samples as a healthcare worker or medical professional in the emergency room.' However, this increases the risk of virus transmission.

**Marburg virus kills nine in Rwanda**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has confirmed 27 cases of Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) and nine deaths in Rwanda as of September 30, 2024. The outbreak was declared by the Ministry of Health on September 27, 2024. The Africa CDC stated, 'Most of the cases are health care workers. Over 297 contacts have been registered and are under follow-up.' The Ministry of Health is working to contain the virus through enhanced preventive measures, contact tracing, and isolation of cases. The Africa CDC has dispatched a team of experts to aid in response efforts and is collaborating with neighboring countries to address cross-border aspects of the outbreak. There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for MVD, so supportive therapy should be initiated immediately for any individuals presenting with the disease. The Minister of Health of Rwanda, Sabin Nsanzimana, will join the Africa CDC Press Briefing on Thursday, October 3, to discuss Rwanda's efforts in curbing the Marburg virus.'

**CDC Statement on Marburg Virus Disease Cases in Rwanda**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are aware of 26 cases of Marburg virus disease in Rwanda, according to the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Rwanda. The CDC is in contact with health officials in Rwanda and the surrounding region. As of now, there have been no reported cases of Marburg virus disease in the United States related to this outbreak, and the risk of cases in the general population in this country is low. The CDC has a long-standing presence in Rwanda, having established an office there in 2002. The CDC office in Rwanda works closely with the government to strengthen health systems and prevent infectious diseases, including training scientists through the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP). The CDC has also worked with Rwanda to implement the US Presidential Plan for Emergency Assistance for HIV/AIDS Relief and the Presidential Malaria Initiative, co-implemented by USAID. These investments and collaborations have strengthened basic capacities that can also be used to respond to this outbreak. The CDC is currently coordinating with the entire US government, including working with the Rwandan ambassador and team on the ground, to address critical public health challenges in the country. The CDC also has a long-standing relationship of trust with the Ministry of Health of Rwanda. The CDC has offered additional support to Rwanda, sending experts to help with the country's investigation and response to the outbreak.
