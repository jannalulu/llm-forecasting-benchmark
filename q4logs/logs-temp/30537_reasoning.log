2024-11-28 13:13:59,841 - INFO - Question: Will the lowest temperature recorded in Miami, FL over the entire month of December 2024 never be lower than the highest temperature recorded in Anchorage Alaska for the month?
2024-11-28 13:13:59,842 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30537:
To approach this forecasting question, let's follow the systematic approach outlined:

1. **Reference and Base Rates**: Historically, in the past five years, Miami's lowest December temperature was 47°F in 2020, while the highest Anchorage temperature was 45°F in the same month of that year. This suggests there's generally a narrow gap when the event could have occurred in the recent past.

2. **Split into Sub-problems**:
   - **Miami December Temperatures**: Consider typical December lows. Historical data suggest temperatures can dip into the 40s. The current climatic conditions, such as La Niña, could lead to anomalies.
   - **Anchorage December Temperatures**: Anchorage's highest December temperature is likely to remain lower than typical Miami lows, given high temperatures rarely break into the mid-40s.

3. **Current News and Trends**: 
   - Warm weather trends globally, indicating possible higher temperatures in Anchorage, which might exceed past highs closer to global warming forecasts.
   - Cold air mass forecasted to affect Miami, suggesting potential lower temperatures than usual.

4. **Strike Balance Between Inside and Outside Views**:
   - The inside view from recent weather forecasts for each location suggests potential deviations from the norm.
   - The outside view considers the broader historical patterns, which show these specific conditions in Miami and Anchorage aligning closely.

5. **Causal Forces**: 
   - **Miami**: Influenced by seasonal patterns, La Niña typically brings warmer conditions, conflicting with incoming cold air trends.
   - **Anchorage**: Anchorage's trend towards warmer winter peaks should also be considered against typical seasonal patterns.

6. **Extrapolate Trends Linearly**: 
   - Increasing likelihood of unusual warmth in Anchorage vs. cooler trends in Miami discussed in news reports.

7. **Degrees of Doubt**: 
   - Consider the possibility of extremes in both locations, factoring in global reports of exceptionally warm years.

8. **Confidence Balancing**: 
   - The probability must recognize both historic outcomes and recent anomalies, neither dismissing current forecasts nor historical frequency.

9. **Error Analysis**:
   - Past underestimations of weather anomaly impacts may lead to correcting biases toward extreme events taking precedence.

**Prediction**: The forecast will consider that while unusual La Niña conditions may elevate Anchorage temperatures and a cold spell in Miami might lower Miami's temperatures more than anticipated, their typical bounds likely hold.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

2024-11-28 13:13:59,855 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30537:
Let me break this down carefully:

1. Historical Pattern Analysis:
- In the past 5 years, this has not occurred, though came close in 2020 (Miami low: 47°F, Anchorage high: 45°F)
- This provides a base rate suggesting this is relatively rare

2. Current Weather Patterns & Forecasts for December 2024:
- Multiple sources indicate La Niña conditions are likely (57% chance) by end of 2024
- La Niña typically brings warmer and drier conditions to South Florida
- Recent articles predict warmer than normal temperatures for South Florida through winter
- Miami recently experienced lows in the 50s, suggesting capability of reaching these temperatures
- A cold front brought temperatures to mid-50s in November 2024

3. Specific Location Analysis:
Miami:
- Recent forecasts suggest warmer than average winter
- La Niña influence points to higher minimum temperatures
- Multiple sources indicate above-normal temperatures expected

Anchorage:
- Arctic weather patterns showing volatility
- Global warming trends affecting Alaska temperatures
- Limited specific forecasts for December 2024

4. Key Factors:
Positive factors (supporting occurrence):
- La Niña keeping Miami warmer
- General warming trends
- Forecasts of warmer winter for Florida

Negative factors (against occurrence):
- Historical precedent shows this hasn't happened in 5 years
- Cold fronts can still reach Miami
- Anchorage can experience warm spells

5. Risk Assessment:
- The requirement for Miami's lowest temperature to exceed Anchorage's highest is quite demanding
- Even with warming trends, winter temperature variations make this unlikely
- Historical pattern suggests low probability

Given the evidence, particularly the historical pattern and the demanding nature of the condition, while acknowledging warming trends and La Niña influence, this remains a low probability event.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.40%, with 18.30% being the most likely. Probability: 18.30%

2024-11-28 13:14:28,153 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30537:
To forecast whether the lowest temperature recorded in Miami over December 2024 will be higher than the highest temperature recorded in Anchorage, I will break the problem into several smaller components and examine the evidence in the context of previous data and current trends.

**Base Rate Analysis:**
1. **Historical Temperature Comparisons:** Past data suggests that Miami rarely dips below freezing even in winter, with lows typically between the 50s and 60s °F during December. Anchorage, on the other hand, can experience highs in the 30s during December, but reaching or exceeding 50°F is rare. This creates a base expectation that Miami's lows are usually higher than Anchorage's highs.
2. **Recent Comparatives:** The information provided indicates that, while rare, there have been close calls, like in December 2020, when Miami's lowest was 47°F, and Anchorage's highest was 45°F. This suggests that while infrequent, the temperature gap can close in certain conditions.

**Current Weather Influences in 2024:**
1. **Global and Regional Weather Patterns:** The articles indicate the likelihood of a La Niña, which might induce slightly different weather patterns. Despite this, the NOAA suggests that South Florida will experience a warmer and drier winter than average, reducing the chance of extremely low temperatures in Miami.
2. **Forecasted Cold Fronts:** A cold front is expected to bring temperatures to possibly sub-50°F levels during November in Miami, suggesting vulnerabilities to lower temperatures as an unusual cold spell from the Arctic affects much of the U.S., seen in the Washington Post article.

**Anchorage's Temperature Pattern:**
1. **Forecasts and Historical Temperature Records:** Anchorage's December temperatures show that highs exceeding 45°F would be notably unusual, though not impossible under certain warming trends attributed to broader climate change.

**Global Warming Context:**
1. **Record High Global Temperatures in 2024:** The globals trend indicates a warmer planet overall, which may affect both Miami and Anchorage's typical weather patterns, possibly moderating extremes in both cold and warm directions, which tends to increase warmer anomalies.

**Conclusion:**
Given the available data, literature, and current climate conditions, the probability suggests that Miami's lowest recorded temperature in December 2024 will likely remain higher than Anchorage's highest. However, the presence of Arctic cold fronts introduces some uncertainty.

**Clashing Causal Forces:**
1. *Supporting "Yes":* Historical temps, predicted La Niña effects, current forecasts for warmer/drier Miami, historical precedent where Miami temps are typically higher.
2. *Supporting "No":* Recent polar cold spell, past close calls in 2020, unpredictability in extremes due to climate change.

To balance this evidence:
- Base rates favor the event.
- Anomalous conditions slightly adjust predictions towards uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 85.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.

2024-11-28 13:14:55,423 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30537:
To begin assessing the probability of this event occurring, we need to examine the base rates for similar events and consider the relevant information provided. 

### Base Rates and Historical Data
1. **Recent Years**: We know that in the past five years, the event has not occurred, but it came close in 2020 when Miami's lowest was 47°F and Anchorage's highest was 45°F. This indicates that the temperature range is close, but Miami generally retains a higher lowest temperature than Anchorage's highest.

2. **Miami December Temperatures**: Miami is known for its warm climate even in December. Historical minimums rarely dip below 50°F according to climatological norms. Articles suggest potential cold snaps, but these are unlikely to fall below these historical norms.

3. **Anchorage December Temperatures**: Anchorage's climate is much colder, with highs often near or below freezing in December. Historical data support that it's unlikely for Anchorage to have very high temperatures during this month.

### News Analysis and Current Context
1. **Cold Weather Incoming**: News articles describe a cold air mass affecting the Eastern United States, potentially reaching Florida. This could suggest slightly colder lows in Miami, but given the region's general climate, extremely cold temperatures remain unlikely.

2. **Miami Weather Forecasts**: Articles indicate temperatures in the 50s but potentially dipping close to typical cold snaps, around mid-40s, might be the lowest. 

3. **Anchorage Weather Forecasts**: Anchorage, being in Alaska, will have a characteristically colder December. It's unlikely for the highest temperature to reach much above the mid- to high-40s, potentially challenging Miami's coldest days only if unusual warming occurs.

### Predictions from Models and Expert Analysis
- **Climate Trends**: Articles predicting warmer and drier winter for South Florida and a La Niña indicate higher likelihood of warmer than usual winter periods in Florida, adding confidence that Miami will not drop substantially below its typical low ranges.
  
- **Global Warming Context**: General data displays a warming trend globally, possibly affecting the severity of each locale’s temperatures, but in context, Miami's relatively warm lows compared to Anchorage's highs during December keeps the historical pattern probable.

### Probabilistic Estimate

Based on historical data, current forecasts, and the statistical likelihood, we conclude the following probabilities:

- **Anchorage reaching a temperature higher than Miami's lowest is unlikely**, but slight variations around that threshold (e.g., a few degrees) are what history suggests are possible. However, given the cold spell across the USA and the global warming context generally keeping Miami's lows above Anchorage's highs, the probability skews towards Miami's lowest staying above Anchorage's highest.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To begin assessing the probability of this event occurring, we need to examine the base rates for similar events and consider the relevant information provided. 

### Base Rates and Historical Data
1. **Recent Years**: We know that in the past five years, the event has not occurred, but it came close in 2020 when Miami's lowest was 47°F and Anchorage's highest was 45°F. This indicates that the temperature range is close, but Miami generally retains a higher lowest temperature than Anchorage's highest.

2. **Miami December Temperatures**: Miami is known for its warm climate even in December. Historical minimums rarely dip below 50°F according to climatological norms. Articles suggest potential cold snaps, but these are unlikely to fall below these historical norms.

3. **Anchorage December Temperatures**: Anchorage's climate is much colder, with highs often near or below freezing in December. Historical data support that it's unlikely for Anchorage to have very high temperatures during this month.

### News Analysis and Current Context
1. **Cold Weather Incoming**: News articles describe a cold air mass affecting the Eastern United States, potentially reaching Florida. This could suggest slightly colder lows in Miami, but given the region's general climate, extremely cold temperatures remain unlikely.

2. **Miami Weather Forecasts**: Articles indicate temperatures in the 50s but potentially dipping close to typical cold snaps, around mid-40s, might be the lowest. 

3. **Anchorage Weather Forecasts**: Anchorage, being in Alaska, will have a characteristically colder December. It's unlikely for the highest temperature to reach much above the mid- to high-40s, potentially challenging Miami's coldest days only if unusual warming occurs.

### Predictions from Models and Expert Analysis
- **Climate Trends**: Articles predicting warmer and drier winter for South Florida and a La Niña indicate higher likelihood of warmer than usual winter periods in Florida, adding confidence that Miami will not drop substantially below its typical low ranges.
  
- **Global Warming Context**: General data displays a warming trend globally, possibly affecting the severity of each locale’s temperatures, but in context, Miami's relatively warm lows compared to Anchorage's highs during December keeps the historical pattern probable.

### Probabilistic Estimate

Based on historical data, current forecasts, and the statistical likelihood, we conclude the following probabilities:

- **Anchorage reaching a temperature higher than Miami's lowest is unlikely**, but slight variations around that threshold (e.g., a few degrees) are what history suggests are possible. However, given the cold spell across the USA and the global warming context generally keeping Miami's lows above Anchorage's highs, the probability skews towards Miami's lowest staying above Anchorage's highest.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

Let me break this down carefully:

1. Historical Pattern:
- In the past 5 years, this has not occurred, though it came close in 2020
- The 2020 example (Miami low: 47°F, Anchorage high: 45°F) gives us a useful reference point

2. Current Climate Conditions:
- Multiple sources indicate 2024 is set to be the hottest year on record globally
- A La Niña pattern is expected to emerge by year's end, which typically brings:
  * Warmer and drier conditions to South Florida
  * Potentially colder conditions to Alaska

3. Specific December 2024 Forecasts:
- For Miami:
  * Reports predict warmer than normal temperatures
  * Recent cold front brought lows only to mid-50s
  * La Niña influence suggests higher minimum temperatures
- For Anchorage:
  * Limited specific forecasts for December
  * Arctic patterns suggest potential for cold temperatures
  * La Niña could bring colder than normal conditions

4. Recent Trends:
- Miami has been experiencing record warmth
- Global warming trends continue to push temperature extremes
- South Florida winter forecast indicates above-average temperatures

5. Risk Analysis:
- For this to occur, Miami's lowest December temperature would need to stay above Anchorage's highest
- Even in a warming climate, cold fronts can still bring significant temperature drops to Miami
- Anchorage can experience relatively mild days even in December

Given that:
- This hasn't happened in recent years
- Even in a record warm year, cold fronts can still reach Miami
- The margin needed (Miami low > Anchorage high) is quite challenging
- But warming trends and La Niña influence provide some possibility

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%

To address this forecasting task accurately, I'll break it down into a series of tractable sub-problems, weighing evidence carefully based on historical data, current trends, and various forecasting principles.

1. **Historical Base Rates**: Historically, the temperature in Miami during December rarely drops below freezing and is typically warmer compared to Anchorage, which is well-known for its colder climate. Over the last five years, similar conditions have approached but not exceeded each other, supporting a high likelihood that Miami's lowest temperature will be higher than Anchorage's highest.

2. **Latest Weather Patterns and Predictions**: Recent articles suggest an intrusion of a cold mass impacting South Florida, leading to some of the lowest expected temperatures around the mid-50s (Fahrenheit) for Miami. On the other hand, predictions and historical data for Anchorage during December indicate that high temperatures could range into the 30s (Fahrenheit), which could pose a potential risk of overlap with historically low Miami temperatures during such cold fronts.

3. **Global Climate Context**: 2024 is set to be the hottest year on record. A warmer global climate typically leads to higher average temperatures across various locations, potentially skewing both Miami and Anchorage temperatures above their historical norms, but the extreme cold front could be significant in this calculation for Anchorage. Similarly, predictions of a La Niña event suggest potential warmer than average conditions in South Florida, though this event is described as weak.

4. **Statistical Considerations**: The probability of Miami’s lowest December temperature being lower than Anchorage’s highest seems quite small based on the data and trends. However, occasional overlaps in recent years warrant consideration of existing cold fronts and cold records, which the articles note could push Miami's temperatures to unusual lows for the region.

5. **Balance of Evidence**: Considering most underlying factors (historical data, absence of extreme cold snap in Miami similar enough to prior overlaps in recent years, general warming trends countered by temporary cold fronts), both a historical and empirical perspective assign relatively low probabilities to the overlap where Miami's minimal dips below Anchorage's maximal temperatures in a given December.

My analysis considers these elements together, leading to a well-grounded predictive judgment:

My Prediction: Between 83.00% and 94.00%, but 89.00% being the most likely. Probability: 89.00%.

To address this forecasting task accurately, I'll break it down into a series of tractable sub-problems, weighing evidence carefully based on historical data, current trends, and various forecasting principles.

1. **Historical Base Rates**: Historically, the temperature in Miami during December rarely drops below freezing and is typically warmer compared to Anchorage, which is well-known for its colder climate. Over the last five years, similar conditions have approached but not exceeded each other, supporting a high likelihood that Miami's lowest temperature will be higher than Anchorage's highest.

2. **Latest Weather Patterns and Predictions**: Recent articles suggest an intrusion of a cold mass impacting South Florida, leading to some of the lowest expected temperatures around the mid-50s (Fahrenheit) for Miami. On the other hand, predictions and historical data for Anchorage during December indicate that high temperatures could range into the 30s (Fahrenheit), which could pose a potential risk of overlap with historically low Miami temperatures during such cold fronts.

3. **Global Climate Context**: 2024 is set to be the hottest year on record. A warmer global climate typically leads to higher average temperatures across various locations, potentially skewing both Miami and Anchorage temperatures above their historical norms, but the extreme cold front could be significant in this calculation for Anchorage. Similarly, predictions of a La Niña event suggest potential warmer than average conditions in South Florida, though this event is described as weak.

4. **Statistical Considerations**: The probability of Miami’s lowest December temperature being lower than Anchorage’s highest seems quite small based on the data and trends. However, occasional overlaps in recent years warrant consideration of existing cold fronts and cold records, which the articles note could push Miami's temperatures to unusual lows for the region.

5. **Balance of Evidence**: Considering most underlying factors (historical data, absence of extreme cold snap in Miami similar enough to prior overlaps in recent years, general warming trends countered by temporary cold fronts), both a historical and empirical perspective assign relatively low probabilities to the overlap where Miami's minimal dips below Anchorage's maximal temperatures in a given December.

My analysis considers these elements together, leading to a well-grounded predictive judgment:

My Prediction: Between 83.00% and 94.00%, but 89.00% being the most likely. Probability: 89.00%.

Let me break this down systematically:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Historical data suggests this has not occurred in the past 5 years
- In 2020, Miami's lowest was 47°F and Anchorage's highest was 45°F, coming close but not meeting the criteria

2. Current Weather Patterns & Forecasts:
- La Niña is expected to emerge by end of 2024 (57% chance)
- This typically brings warmer and drier conditions to South Florida
- Recent cold front brought temperatures to mid-50s in Miami in November
- Multiple sources predict warmer than average winter for South Florida
- Miami forecast shows temperatures likely staying above 50°F

3. Specific Evidence Supporting Higher Probability:
- La Niña conditions typically keep Miami temperatures higher
- 2024 is predicted to be the hottest year on record globally
- South Florida winter forecast indicates warmer than normal conditions

4. Specific Evidence Supporting Lower Probability:
- News of a brutal cold air mass moving towards eastern US
- Cold front bringing temperatures to mid-50s in Miami recently
- Historical precedent shows this hasn't happened in past 5 years

5. Key Considerations:
- Only need one day in December where Anchorage's high exceeds Miami's low
- Miami's winter lows typically occur in early morning hours
- Strong cold fronts can still bring brief but significant temperature drops
- Anchorage can experience occasional warm spells due to chinook winds

Given these factors, this seems unlikely but not impossible. The combination of La Niña and record global temperatures provides some upward pressure, but historical patterns and recent cold fronts suggest caution. The fact that this hasn't occurred in the past 5 years, even in similar conditions, is particularly telling.

To forecast whether the lowest temperature recorded in Miami, FL, over the month of December 2024 will never be lower than the highest temperature recorded in Anchorage, AK, for the month, I need to analyze various aspects. 

**Base Rates and Historical Context**

Historically, there have been instances where Miami's December temperatures dipped to around 47°F and Anchorage's highs peaked around 45°F, such as in December 2020. However, these occurrences have been rare and have not happened in the past five years. This suggests a low probability base rate for Miami's minimum being lower than Anchorage's maximum.

**Current Weather Predictions and Trends**

1. **Miami Weather Patterns:**
   - **Cold Spells and Cold Fronts:** Recent news articles indicate an unseasonable cold front moving toward southern Florida, with Miami possibly experiencing lower temperatures ranging from the 40s to 50s in early December 2024. 
   - **Predicted Seasonal Outlook:** Based on the impact of a weak La Niña, there is an expectation for a warmer and drier winter in Florida. Even with short-term cold spells, the chronic absence of extreme cold due to La Niña suggests a higher minimum baseline relative to historical records.
   - **Climatic Trends:** The year 2024 is projected to be the warmest on record globally, potentially impacting Miami's climate, leaning toward warmer temperatures.

2. **Anchorage Weather Patterns:**
   - **Polar Weather Events:** With moves of cold Arctic air masses and potential warming tendencies under climate change models, there's a potential for increased temperature anomalies. However, it is unlikely to see drastically high December temperatures in Anchorage given historical data.
   - **Normal Temperature Dynamics:** Typically, Anchorage in December experiences frequent lows well below freezing, with occasional warm spikes that don't typically exceed the low-40s. Current projections do not indicate significant upward deviations from this pattern.

3. **Long-term Warming Trends:** Global warming trends underscore escalating temperatures which affect cold spells' severity and duration worldwide, affecting baseline temperatures more so than extreme temperature records in the north vs. the south USA.

**Reference Classes and Statistical Support**

Given the historical base rates and present climatic trends coupled with the predicted meteorological patterns, this scenario remains unlikely. Most external forecast institutions like Metaculus might provide insights. Without available probabilities directly from other forecasters, I must closely infer them. Trends favor Miami consistently having higher lowest temperatures than Anchorage's highest in December unless otherwise disrupted by exceptionally rare climatic anomalies.

**Balance of Factors**

1. **Evidence against:** Historical maximum December temperatures in Anchorage under 45°F, expected mild warming trends due to climate effects.
2. **Evidence for:** Anomalous weather conditions bringing unseasonable cold spells, albeit rare in affecting Miami to relevant extents in comparison to Anchorage.

My estimated probability takes into account these dynamics, aiming to balance competing narratives while leveraging historical insights. 

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

2024-11-28 13:15:37,207 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30537:
To forecast whether the lowest temperature recorded in Miami, FL, over the month of December 2024 will never be lower than the highest temperature recorded in Anchorage, AK, for the month, I need to analyze various aspects. 

**Base Rates and Historical Context**

Historically, there have been instances where Miami's December temperatures dipped to around 47°F and Anchorage's highs peaked around 45°F, such as in December 2020. However, these occurrences have been rare and have not happened in the past five years. This suggests a low probability base rate for Miami's minimum being lower than Anchorage's maximum.

**Current Weather Predictions and Trends**

1. **Miami Weather Patterns:**
   - **Cold Spells and Cold Fronts:** Recent news articles indicate an unseasonable cold front moving toward southern Florida, with Miami possibly experiencing lower temperatures ranging from the 40s to 50s in early December 2024. 
   - **Predicted Seasonal Outlook:** Based on the impact of a weak La Niña, there is an expectation for a warmer and drier winter in Florida. Even with short-term cold spells, the chronic absence of extreme cold due to La Niña suggests a higher minimum baseline relative to historical records.
   - **Climatic Trends:** The year 2024 is projected to be the warmest on record globally, potentially impacting Miami's climate, leaning toward warmer temperatures.

2. **Anchorage Weather Patterns:**
   - **Polar Weather Events:** With moves of cold Arctic air masses and potential warming tendencies under climate change models, there's a potential for increased temperature anomalies. However, it is unlikely to see drastically high December temperatures in Anchorage given historical data.
   - **Normal Temperature Dynamics:** Typically, Anchorage in December experiences frequent lows well below freezing, with occasional warm spikes that don't typically exceed the low-40s. Current projections do not indicate significant upward deviations from this pattern.

3. **Long-term Warming Trends:** Global warming trends underscore escalating temperatures which affect cold spells' severity and duration worldwide, affecting baseline temperatures more so than extreme temperature records in the north vs. the south USA.

**Reference Classes and Statistical Support**

Given the historical base rates and present climatic trends coupled with the predicted meteorological patterns, this scenario remains unlikely. Most external forecast institutions like Metaculus might provide insights. Without available probabilities directly from other forecasters, I must closely infer them. Trends favor Miami consistently having higher lowest temperatures than Anchorage's highest in December unless otherwise disrupted by exceptionally rare climatic anomalies.

**Balance of Factors**

Let me break this down systematically:

1. Historical Pattern Analysis:
- The background information indicates this has not occurred in the past 5 years
- In 2020, Miami's lowest was 47°F and Anchorage's highest was 45°F, coming close but not meeting the criteria

2. Current Climate Context:
- Multiple articles indicate 2024 is set to be the warmest year on record globally
- A La Niña pattern is expected to emerge by December 2024, which typically brings:
  * Warmer and drier conditions to South Florida
  * Colder conditions to Alaska

3. Specific December 2024 Forecasts for Miami:
- Several articles mention a warmer winter forecast for South Florida
- The November 2024 cold front brought temperatures only to the mid-50s
- Seasonal forecasts suggest above-average temperatures

4. Specific December 2024 Forecasts for Anchorage:
- Limited specific forecasts for December
- The formation of La Niña typically brings colder conditions to Alaska
- Arctic regions are showing significant temperature anomalies

5. Risk Analysis:
Pro-occurrence:
- Record warm year globally
- Warmer winter forecast for Miami
- La Niña typically keeps Miami warmer

Against occurrence:
- Historical precedent shows this hasn't happened in 5+ years
- Cold fronts can still reach Miami (as shown in November)
- Even in a warm year, brief cold snaps are possible
- Anchorage can experience winter warm spells

Given that this event hasn't occurred in the past 5 years despite close calls, and considering the competing factors of record warmth but also the possibility of cold fronts, I need to weight this relatively low but higher than historical precedent would suggest due to the exceptional warmth of 2024.

  * Warmer and drier conditions to South Florida
  * Colder conditions to Alaska

3. Specific December 2024 Forecasts for Miami:
- Several articles mention a warmer winter forecast for South Florida
- The November 2024 cold front brought temperatures only to the mid-50s
- Seasonal forecasts suggest above-average temperatures

4. Specific December 2024 Forecasts for Anchorage:
- Limited specific forecasts for December
- The formation of La Niña typically brings colder conditions to Alaska
- Arctic regions are showing significant temperature anomalies

5. Risk Analysis:
Pro-occurrence:
- Record warm year globally
- Warmer winter forecast for Miami
- La Niña typically keeps Miami warmer

Against occurrence:
- Historical precedent shows this hasn't happened in 5+ years
- Cold fronts can still reach Miami (as shown in November)
- Even in a warm year, brief cold snaps are possible
- Anchorage can experience winter warm spells

Given that this event hasn't occurred in the past 5 years despite close calls, and considering the competing factors of record warmth but also the possibility of cold fronts, I need to weight this relatively low but higher than historical precedent would suggest due to the exceptional warmth of 2024.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%
