**Joe Biden's Last 60 Days: A Rush to Preserve His Legacy**
As Joe Biden's time in the White House comes to an end, he is working against the clock to preserve his legacy before Donald Trump takes over on January 20, 2025. Biden has promised a peaceful transition and has been working tirelessly to achieve his goals, taking advantage of the media attention focused on Trump. However, his power is limited, and he has become a 'lame duck' president with reduced influence due to the proximity of Trump's arrival. Biden's team is working on several measures to strengthen Ukraine's position before Trump takes over, including sending $9 billion in approved but undelivered military aid to Ukraine and authorizing the use of ATACMS missiles against Russian targets. The goal is to fortify Ukraine's position in any future negotiations with Russia. Biden also wants to use his remaining time to broker a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and secure the release of Israeli hostages. He is maintaining intense diplomatic efforts with Egypt and Qatar, key mediators, and has met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog at the White House. Additionally, Biden wants to consolidate his legacy on climate change, saying 'History is watching us.' His team is working to finalize a 'clean fuel credit' regulation, which would provide tax incentives for companies producing low-emission fuels for aviation and other transportation. The Biden administration also plans to publish a study on the environmental and economic impact of liquefied natural gas. Furthermore, Biden wants to finalize a regulation to cancel student loans for people with economic difficulties. However, the Department of Education has a limited timeframe to complete this process, which normally takes months, but now must be completed in weeks and may face legal challenges. Finally, the White House is accelerating efforts to confirm as many judges as possible before the Senate, currently controlled by Democrats, passes to Republican hands on January 3. Trump has urged Republicans to block these efforts, saying 'They shouldn't approve judges during this period.'

**Biden has become notably quiet after the 2024 election and Democrats’ loss**
President Joe Biden has been notably quiet since the Democrats' loss in the 2024 election, with his only public discussion of the outcome being a six-minute speech in the Rose Garden two days after the election. Biden's silence has been met with a new reality: America and the rest of the world is already moving on. 'His race is over. His day is done,' said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser in the Obama-Biden White House. Biden's allies say the president is privately processing the election defeat, but Biden hasn't been vocally introspective about his role in the loss. Biden's insistence on following electoral traditions, such as ensuring an orderly transition and inviting Trump to the White House, is seen as important, but his public silence has left a vacuum. 'The last time a president left office so irrelevant or rejected by the populace was Jimmy Carter,' said Edward Frantz, a historian at the University of Indianapolis. 'History has allowed for the great rehabilitation of Carter, in part, because of all he did in his post-presidency. At 82, I'm not sure Biden has the luxury of time.'

**Looking back at the life and presidency of Joe Biden**
As Joe Biden prepares to leave the White House, his long career has been marked by numerous ups and downs. Biden was first named president on January 20, 2021, after one of the most publicized and nerve-racking presidential elections in US history. His presidency has been controversial, particularly due to his unyielding support of Israel and the war on Gaza. However, Biden's trials and tribulations did not begin in 2021. As he marks his 82nd birthday, here's a glimpse into his career, family history, and his life before the White House.

**Trump may review Biden's decision on strikes inside Russia with US missiles**
A member of Donald Trump's transition team stated that Trump may review Joe Biden's decision to authorize the use of US-supplied long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. 'I suspect most everything will be under review,' the team member said. Trump's inauguration is set for January 20, 2025, and until then, Biden remains the president. The Pentagon has refused to comment on the reports, while the White House and the Department of State have not yet responded to TASS' inquiry. The Republican Party is expected to gain control of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

**Will the US Administration Provide Ukraine with the Allocated Aid Before January 20, 2025?**
Professor Igor Ayzenberg from the Manhattan University believes that the outgoing administration of US President Joe Biden will use all the allocated funds for Ukraine before January 20, 2025, to provide several large packages of military aid. The character of the military aid, particularly the provision of long-range weapons to Ukraine, will not change. Ayzenberg is confident that the Biden administration will not allow Ukraine to strike targets deep in Russia with American weapons, as this could lead to a nuclear attack by Russia. The expert expects that the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump will have a different policy towards Europe and Ukraine, which may lead to a decrease in support for Ukraine. Ayzenberg also notes that the position of the European Union on Ukraine will be influenced by the upcoming elections in European countries, which may lead to a shift to the right and a decrease in support for Ukraine. However, he also mentions that there are some exceptions among European politicians, such as the President of Poland Andrzej Duda and the Prime Minister of Italy Giorgia Meloni, who support Ukraine despite being from right-wing parties.

**Biden Meets with Trump to Discuss Transfer of Power**
US President Joe Biden is meeting with his successor, Donald Trump, at the White House to discuss the transfer of power. This is a tradition in the US for a peaceful transfer of power, which Trump himself refused four years ago. Trump still refuses to acknowledge his loss to Biden in the 2020 election. The meeting is also expected to include a discussion with top Republicans in Congress, as Trump's party has secured a majority in the Senate and is likely to dominate the House of Representatives in the next two years. According to Congressman Tom Emmer, 'I expect him to make a big statement today, something like a cabinet address, to prepare everyone for what's coming in January.' Trump's inauguration is scheduled for January 20, 2025. He will be accompanied by billionaire Elon Musk, who will also serve as an advisor to a new government efficiency agency. This is seen as unusual by observers, as Trump announced Musk's planned appointment just two days ago.

**Joe Biden to Welcome Donald Trump to the White House for Transition Meeting**
US President Joe Biden will meet with President-elect Donald Trump at the White House to initiate the transition of power. Despite Trump's team not signing the necessary documents, the meeting is designed to show a smooth transition between the two governments. Trump won the presidential election on November 5, 2024, with over 270 electoral votes, and will become the 47th President of the US on January 20, 2025. According to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, 'He believes in the norms, believes in our institution, believes in the peaceful transfer of power. That's what it's supposed to be.' This is a traditional courtesy that outgoing presidents extend to their successors, which Trump did not do to Biden in 2020 when he won.

**'Joe Biden Charged To Resign, Hand Over To Harris As First Female President'**
Simmons suggested that President Joe Biden should resign and hand over the presidency to Kamala Harris, citing Biden's promise to be a transitional figure. This proposal comes after the recent U.S. presidential election, in which Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris. Trump is set to be inaugurated as the 47th President of the United States in January 2025. Simmons's suggestion reflects ongoing discussions within the Democratic Party about leadership transitions and the party's future direction. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has denied a report that President-elect Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin about the Ukraine conflict, with Putin's Press Secretary calling the report 'completely false information'.

**Kamala's ex-aide suggests Biden step down, making her first female US Prez**
Jamal Simmons, a former aide to Kamala Harris, has suggested that President Joe Biden should step down and allow Harris to assume the presidency until January 20, 2025, when Donald Trump takes office. Simmons argued that this move would disrupt Trump's momentum and spare Harris the responsibility of overseeing the certification of Trump's victory in Congress on January 6. According to Simmons, 'Joe Biden has been a remarkable president, fulfilling many of his promises. However, there's one final promise he could still keep: serving as a transitional figure.' This proposal comes amid internal criticism of Biden from Democratic figures, who claim his leadership may have contributed to Harris's loss in the election.

**Former Harris Communications Director Calls on Biden to Resign and Make Harris President**
Jamal Simmons, the former communications director for Kamala Harris, has called on President Joe Biden to resign and be replaced by Harris as the 47th President of the United States. Simmons praised Biden as 'exceptional' but noted that there is one promise left to fulfill, which is for Biden to step down and make Harris the President. This would allow Harris to avoid overseeing the transition of power on January 6, 2025, after their expected loss in the 2024 US elections. Simmons said that this move would dominate the headlines at a time when Democrats need to learn about transparency and doing things that the public wants to see. He added that this is the right moment for Democrats to change their perspective on how they operate. Simmons also emphasized that Democrats need to understand that the old rules no longer apply, and that Americans respond to drama and excitement.

**Biden's 'Lame Duck' Session: Will the US Cause Problems for Russia Before Leaving Office?**
US President Joe Biden's administration may try to cause problems for Russia before he leaves office, according to political analyst Malik Dudakov. Maria Zakharova, the official representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, previously stated that the outgoing administration may 'goad' Russia before leaving the White House. Zakharova noted that the outgoing administration has a few months left and can 'goad' Russia during this time. Dudakov explained that the period when the outgoing president is transitioning power is called the 'session of the lame duck,' but the US has deviated from this tradition due to the current division in the country and the Democrats' rejection of it. Therefore, Dudakov believes that the administration may try to create some problems for Russia. The administration is also trying to quickly spend the remaining funds allocated for Ukraine. 'In the near future, the Congress will try to 'drag' some new aid packages for Ukraine for 2025, while the old Congress is still in place until the beginning of January 2025. They will also try to make some diplomatic gestures regarding Ukraine, such as long-range missiles, so that the next president would have less space for maneuver,' said Dudakov. However, political analyst Konstantin Blyukher believes that there is no need to expect serious problems from the Biden administration. 'If something serious is to be done, it needs to have a time buffer. In two months, it is impossible to do something of such scale. It is only possible to make some small provocations. Moreover, all world elites, American and European, are waiting for Trump. Even though he has not arrived, he is already putting pressure on them,' said Blyukher.

**Biden to Receive Trump at the White House for Transfer of Power**
US President Joe Biden will receive his successor, Donald Trump, at the White House on Wednesday for the transfer of power. Trump won the election on Tuesday. According to a statement by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, 'By invitation of President Biden, President Biden and President-elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday at 11:00 a.m. (5:00 p.m. in the Spanish Peninsula)'. The meeting will be the first time the two have been in the same room since the presidential debate on June 29, 2024. Biden has invited Trump to the White House to discuss the transition of power and to 'lower the temperature' of the US political climate. Trump has accepted the invitation and has already begun to assemble his transition team, which includes allies, friends, and family members. The transition of power in the US is a well-established procedure that begins a year before the presidential election, but takes shape when a president-elect is declared. The goal is to have the new administration up and running smoothly when the new president takes office on January 20, 2025.

**What's in Store for Donald Trump Before Inauguration: A Potential Storm in the Capitol**
As the 20th Amendment to the US Constitution dictates, Joe Biden will remain in office until January 20, 2025, when Donald Trump will be inaugurated. During this transition period, Biden will continue to make key decisions, including appointing ambassadors, judges, and ministers, and issuing executive orders. However, these decisions can be blocked by the Republican-controlled Congress after January 3, when the new Congress is sworn in. According to Valerie Boyd, director of the Center for Presidential Transition, each government agency has prepared materials for Trump's team, outlining existing problems and potential priorities. Trump, meanwhile, is forming his future team and has already begun consulting with advisors. He has promised to appoint loyalists to key positions, including those on the second tier. The real test of Trump's intentions will come after January 20. In the past, Trump has made promises and proposals, but it was only after taking office that his true actions became clear. This time, Trump may avoid repeating the mistakes of his previous presidency, including the scandal surrounding Michael Flynn's unauthorized contact with the Russian ambassador in 2016. The coming weeks will show whether the transfer of power in the US will proceed smoothly or if the losing side has planned a surprise for the 47th president. A 'People's March on Washington' is planned for January 18, 2025, with over 50,000 participants expected to express their dissatisfaction with the election results. The storming of the Capitol by Trump supporters in 2021 may seem like a minor incident compared to what may come next.

**Joe Biden's Presidency to End in 2025**
Joe Biden's presidency is coming to an end as he will transfer power to the newly elected president in a few months. Although Biden initially announced his re-election as a Democratic president, he has since withdrawn his candidacy and Kamala Harris has taken his place. However, the US electorate favored Donald Trump in the elections, who received 295 electoral votes. Biden's term will end on January 20, 2025, and Trump will take office, along with J.D. Vance as his vice president. Biden has held various positions, including senator for Delaware for 36 years and vice president under Barack Obama. It is unclear if he will return to US politics after leaving the presidency.

**From power vacuums, protests to swearing in - what happens next in the US election**
The US presidential election remains on a knife edge as polling stations close in the tightest race for the White House in decades. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are yet to learn who will be the 47th President after a bitter contest with a razor-thin margin between the candidates in key swing states. The new President will not be officially sworn in until 6 January 2025 when the US Congress certifies the result. During the transition period, Joe Biden will remain as a lame duck President until 20 January, 2025, when the new President is sworn in at their inauguration. The outgoing administration will brief its successor on important national security, foreign affairs and other issues. The new President will fill about 7,000 executive branch positions, including the secretaries of state and defence, which require Senate confirmation. The result of the electoral college votes is usually confirmed after meetings on 17 December, and the new US Congress meets on 6 January to count the electoral college votes and confirm the new president.

**US President Biden May Transfer Long-Range Weapons to Ukraine Before Term Ends**
US President Joe Biden may decide to transfer long-range weapons to the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) before his term ends in January 2025, according to political technologist and analyst Pavel Dubravsky. He believes that Biden will likely make this decision after the presidential elections, as he will no longer be accountable to his potential successor Kamala Harris or his advisors. 'He won't be re-elected, so he can do whatever he thinks is right in this situation,' Dubravsky said in an interview with Lenta.Ru. Dubravsky is confident that even if Biden does not make this decision, the Democratic Party will continue to lobby for arms supplies to Ukraine. 'In this case, everything depends on the outcomes of the congressional elections, which will take place simultaneously with the presidential elections,' he noted. The US has already announced plans to increase arms supplies to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft systems. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia will take countermeasures if Ukraine uses long-range weapons to attack Russian territory.

**Biden May Transfer Long-Range Weapons to Ukraine Before Leaving Office**
US President Joe Biden may decide to transfer long-range weapons to the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) shortly before his departure, according to political technologist and analyst Pavel Dubravsky. He believes that Biden may choose to make this move as a 'parting gift' after the US presidential elections, without being influenced by his potential successor Kamala Harris or his advisors, who will be less constrained by the end of his career. Dubravsky notes that Biden will not be re-elected in the future. The US presidential elections are scheduled for November 5, 2024, and Biden's term will expire in January 2025. Malak Dudakov, an Americanist, previously stated that if either Trump or Harris wins, the Ukrainian conflict will become less of a priority for the US, as they will focus on resolving the Middle East crisis and countering China. 'It's not a secret that in the event of a change of power in the US, the priorities of the new administration will change,' Dubravsky said. 'But it's also not a secret that the current administration is not going to leave Ukraine in the lurch.'

Dubravsky believes that Biden will likely make this decision after the presidential elections, as he will no longer be accountable to his advisors or his potential successor Kamala Harris. 'He won't be re-elected, so he can do whatever he thinks is right in the situation,' Dubravsky said. However, even if Biden doesn't make this decision, the Democratic Party will continue to lobby for arms supplies to Ukraine, depending on the outcome of the Congressional elections. 'A divided Congress could be beneficial for Republicans,' Dubravsky noted. Dubravsky previously stated that neither a hypothetical Trump or Harris victory would lead to the end of the US-Russia conflict.

**Biden to Attend Inauguration of Successor, Regardless of Election Outcome**
US President Joe Biden plans to attend the inauguration of his successor or successors in January, regardless of the election outcome. According to White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre, 'It's not about him. It's about the American people. That's what the American people need to see, regardless of who wins.' Biden, 81, had previously withdrawn from the presidential election due to increasing criticism of his age and nominated his vice president as a replacement candidate. The election is now a close contest between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. It is customary in the US for the outgoing president to attend the inauguration of their successor, but Trump broke with tradition in 2021 by not attending Biden's inauguration. Trump had left the White House just hours before the inauguration and still refuses to acknowledge his defeat in the 2020 presidential election.
