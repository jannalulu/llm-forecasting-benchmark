**Brazilian Real Hits New Record Low Against US Dollar**
The Brazilian real has hit a new record low against the US dollar, with the dollar selling at R$ 6,267, the highest nominal level in history. Analysts attribute the surge to fears that the government's proposed spending cuts will be watered down in Congress, as well as the reduction of interest rates in the US by the Federal Reserve. Minister of Finance Fernando Haddad attempted to downplay the situation, stating that the dollar will stabilize in the coming months due to a temporary economic uncertainty. However, his words were not heeded by the market. Haddad explained, 'We have a floating exchange rate that, in this moment of uncertainty, reflects a climate of uncertainty. This makes the exchange rate fluctuate.' Despite the positive economic indicators, such as a 2.9% growth in GDP in 2023 and a predicted 3.39% growth in 2024, the high dollar is a concern, as it will impact the purchasing power of Brazilian citizens. The government is facing criticism from economists and market operators, with only 4% of financial agents approving of the Ministry of Finance's management, according to a recent survey.

**The Lone Star State is soaring America's future will be made in Texas**
Texas is experiencing a surge in population and economic growth, with the potential to become the most populous state in the US. The state's young and diverse population, with a strong focus on high-tech industry and multiculturalism, could be a model for rebuilding America. However, this success is ironic given Texas's history as a bastion of conservatism and slavery. As former governor and senator Wilbert 'Pappy' O'Daniel once said, 'Texas had become New York's most valuable foreign possession'. Despite its past, Texas is now a hub of progress and innovation, with many people fleeing California to settle there. If Texas can overcome its conservative tendencies, it could be a beacon for a brighter future for the US.

**CNI projects 3.5% GDP growth in 2024 and 2.4% in 2025**
The Brazilian Confederation of Industry (CNI) presented its report 'Economia Brasileira 2024-2025' on Tuesday (17), projecting a 3.5% increase in the country's GDP (PIB) in 2024, more than double the previous estimate of 1.7%. In 2025, the growth is expected to slow down, but still reach 2.4% by the end of the year. According to Mário Sergio Telles, superintendente of Economy at CNI, 'This is the third consecutive year of growth above 3%, which is surprising.' The main reason for this positive outcome is the labor market, which has seen an increase in employment and real income since 2022. 'This was the big surprise compared to our forecast at the end of 2023,' Telles said.

**New Uncertainties Underlie Near-Future Economy as New Administration Implements Policies**
The UCLA Anderson Forecast predicts that the U.S. national economy will outshine its global peers, but with GDP growth expected to fall below 2% due to the impact of new economic policies implemented by the Trump administration. The policies, including tariffs on Mexico and Canada, mass deportations, and tax cuts, will raise prices and create labor shortages, leading to lower GDP growth. The California economy is also expected to grow more slowly than previously forecast, with the state's economy expected to grow at about the same rate as the country's in 2025 and 2026. The forecast anticipates a rise in wages due to labor shortages, and a recovery in the housing sector, but notes that the private sector's prospect of building out of the housing affordability problem over the next three years is nil.

**FORECLOSURE FILINGS EASE NATIONWIDE IN NOVEMBER 2024 AMID SEASONAL INFLUENCES**
According to ATTOM, a leading curator of land, property data, and real estate analytics, foreclosure filings in the US decreased by 9% from last year and 5% from the prior month, with a total of 29,390 properties with foreclosure filings in November 2024. The slight decline is attributed to seasonal influences. States with the highest foreclosure rates were Nevada, Florida, and Connecticut, with one in every 2,941, 3,047, and 3,210 housing units, respectively, having a foreclosure filing. The greatest number of foreclosure starts were in Texas, Florida, California, and New York, while the greatest number of completed foreclosures were in California, Texas, New York, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. Foreclosure completions increased by 21% from last year, with 3,089 U.S. properties repossessed through completed foreclosures (REOs) in November 2024.

**New economic stats out for Austin; What will 2025 yield?**
The Austin metro's real GDP grew by 4.5% in 2023, reaching $207.47 billion, according to the latest federal data. This growth rate is solid, but lower than the 9.6% increase in 2022. Alan McKnight, chief investment officer for Regions Bank, called the growth rate 'very solid' and noted that it's well above the country's real GDP growth rate for 2023. However, uncertainty surrounding national economic policies, particularly under the incoming Trump Administration, may impact the economy in 2025. McKnight declined to make a 2025 prediction, citing the need for clarity on policy decisions and their effects on the economy. He noted that any new tariffs or immigration policies could have an inflationary impact, potentially affecting companies and consumers. Despite this uncertainty, McKnight expects Austin to continue to boast a stronger than average economy, driven by companies and people relocating to the area.

**Texans are on the move -- But they're not going far**
Around 3.36 million Texas residents relocated within the state in 2023, the highest number of any state in the U.S., according to a report from Texas Realtors. This figure represents a strong desire by many Texans to remain in Texas. The state's population surged over the past few years, with a 1.6 percent annual growth rate, the third highest in the U.S. In 2023, around 612,000 people moved to Texas from other states, while 479,000 people moved out, resulting in a net inflow of about 133,000 people. California was the top state for people moving to Texas, with 94,000 people, while California also had the most people leaving Texas, with 39,000. Texas Realtors chair Jef Conn said, 'Texas is a great place to live, with our wide variety of locations, quality of life, and thriving economy.' The state's economy grew by five percent in real GDP terms in the fourth quarter of 2023, above the U.S. figure of 3.4 percent.

**California, Florida, and the Great Migration: Why Residents Are Leaving and Where They're Going**
A recent report using US Census data showed the top states for internal migration in 2023, with California, Florida, New York, Texas, and Illinois leading the list. The reasons behind this trend include job opportunities, cost of living, tax policies, and personal preferences related to climate or lifestyle. California's high migration rate can be attributed to its high cost of living, particularly in metropolitan areas like Los Angeles and San Francisco, where housing prices exceed the national average. Additionally, the state's strict tax policies have motivated many to seek more accessible alternatives. However, California is not only losing residents but also attracting thousands from other states, demonstrating a constant migratory exchange. Florida remains an attractive destination due to its warm climate and lack of state income tax, but some residents have noted challenges related to housing accessibility and the increase in natural disasters like hurricanes. Texas's diverse economy and favorable tax policy have traditionally been attractive factors, but the rapid growth of cities like Austin and Dallas has increased the cost of living, prompting some to seek less densely populated states. New York and Illinois are seeking a better quality of life, with New York losing 483,523 people in 2023, with the most popular destinations being Florida, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The COVID-19 pandemic intensified this trend, allowing many New Yorkers to move to more affordable places without losing their jobs. According to Voronoi, Florida's popularity is due to its warm climate, but others have chosen to stay close by moving to neighboring states like New Jersey.

**Global Real Wage Growth Expected to Reach 15-Year High in 2024**
According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), the global real wage growth rate is expected to be 2.7% in 2024, the highest in over 15 years. However, most regions' real wages are still lower than before the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting the ongoing erosion of people's purchasing power due to rising living costs. ILO Secretary-General Gilbert Houngbo said, 'If this trend is confirmed, it would be the largest increase in over 15 years...However, this positive trend is not shared equally by all regions.' The report found that emerging economies grew faster than advanced economies in 2023, with a 6% increase in real wages in G20 emerging economies, compared to a 0.5% decline in G20 advanced economies. The growth rate of real wages varies significantly across regions, with Central Asia and the Middle East experiencing the highest growth rate of 17.9%, followed by Eastern Europe at 9.3%, and the Asia-Pacific region at 2.9%. However, the Asia-Pacific region's growth rate is heavily influenced by China, and excluding China, the growth rate is expected to be only 1.5%. In contrast, Latin America and the Caribbean region is expected to grow by 1.5%, North America by 0.3%, Africa by 0%, and the Arab States by -0.1%.

The US GDP growth rate for the third quarter was revised to 2.8%, the same as the initial value, with personal consumption expenditure strong, business equipment investment expanding, and exports and government spending accelerating. However, housing investment and construction investment were relatively weak, indicating that high interest rates are still having a suppressing effect.

**Trump's Tariffs: Texas and Michigan, the Most Affected**
According to Corporación Actinver, if President-elect Donald Trump imposes additional tariffs on Mexico, the states of Texas and Michigan will be the most affected. This is because they receive 44.5% of Mexico's exports, with Texas receiving 30% and Michigan receiving 14.5%. José Ramón de la Rosa, subdirector of analysis at Actinver, stated, 'If there are additional taxes, American companies will pay more for products.' De la Rosa also mentioned that other states receiving a large number of Mexican goods include California, Illinois, and Tennessee. He also noted that migrants arriving in the US are not taking jobs from citizens, but rather filling labor gaps. 'Migrants are helping the US labor market to be adequately staffed for various tasks,' he said. Actinver's economic forecasts for Mexico predict a dollar exchange rate of 20-20.50 pesos for 2024 and 20.30 pesos for 2025. The organization also estimates a GDP growth rate of 1.4% for 2024 and 1.5% for 2025.

**This sport was the fastest-growing outdoor activity last year**
Bicycling saw a 26.6% increase in popularity in 2023, making it the fastest-growing outdoor recreation activity. Outdoor recreation generated $1.2 trillion for the U.S. economy last year, with California, Florida, and Texas being the top states. The growth in bike riding can be attributed to environmental awareness, health and fitness, urban congestion, improved bike paths, cost efficiency, and the proliferation of e-bikes. Jessica Turner, president of the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable, said, 'Millions are flocking to the outdoors.' The number of participants increased across demographics and activities, with a record 175.8 million Americans participating in outdoor recreation in 2023, up 4.1% over the year before. Boating/fishing saw the largest increase with $36.8 billion in value added in 2023, followed by RVing, hunting/shooting/trapping, motorcycling/ATVing, and winter activities. California had the largest share of its economy related to outdoor recreation at $81.5 billion, with Hawaii having the largest share of its economy related to outdoor recreation at 6.3% of its GDP.

**New York, other blue states losing out to ‘vibrant’ lower-cost regions as migration trend continues, data shows**
According to new data from the Census Bureau, high-tax states like New York, California, and Illinois are losing population to lower-cost regions like Texas, Florida, and North Carolina. Experts warn that this trend, which has been ongoing for several years, is here to stay. Ana Bozovic of Miami Analytics stated, 'I do not see a reversal: there will be no mass reverse migration back to high-tax states.' Mark Perry of the American Enterprise Institute attributed the decline to 'higher tax burdens and unfriendly business climates.' He described red states like Florida as 'more economically vibrant, dynamic and business friendly.' The data showed that New York lost 179,000 more people than it gained in 2023, with the largest number of leavers choosing Florida as their destination. California lost a quarter million-plus people, with over 50,000 moving to Texas, including billionaire Elon Musk.

**Economic Slowdown in Mexico: BBVA Report Predicts 1.2% Growth Rate in 2024**
According to the BBVA report, the economic slowdown in Mexico is reflected in all 32 states, with a predicted growth rate of 1.2% in 2024, down from 1.3% in 2023. The report attributes this slowdown to a weak domestic demand, reduced job creation, decreased public spending, and a decline in demand for durable goods in the US. BBVA Research predicts that Mexico's GDP will grow by 1.2% in 2024 and 1.0% in 2025. The report notes that the states with the highest growth rates in 2024 will be Nayarit and Hidalgo, with 1.9% each, followed by Baja California Sur with 1.8%. However, these states had much higher growth rates in 2023, with 5.3%, 4.5%, and 5.2% respectively. On the other hand, Campeche is expected to experience a 0.2% decline in its state GDP in 2024, compared to a 2.5% growth rate in 2023. The states with the lowest growth rates in 2024 are Durango, Oaxaca, and Tlaxcala, with 0.6%, 0.7%, and 0.7% respectively. The report also notes that the growth in some states in 2023 was driven by large infrastructure projects such as the Dos Bocas refinery and the Tren Maya. However, these projects are expected to slow down in 2024, leading to a decline in investment and employment in states such as Tabasco, Yucatán, Campeche, Quintana Roo, and Oaxaca. 'The reduction in growth in 2024 is significant in all states,' the report states. 'By the end of 2024, the state-level outlook is more gloomy, given the weakness of domestic demand, moderate investment, and the decline in public spending, as well as the high interest rates that persisted in the first half of the year,' it adds.

**California and Texas Lead in Attracting Foreign Direct Investment in the United States**
According to a report by the Department of Commerce, California and Texas ranked among the top states in the United States for attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in 2023. Missouri led the indicator, but its value was not disclosed due to confidentiality requirements. California came in second with $12,800 million, followed by New Jersey with $12,100 million and Texas with $10,100 million. The total FDI inflow for 2023 was $148,800 million, according to preliminary statistics published by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. California's economy, the largest in the U.S., accounted for 14% of the country's GDP in 2023 and was ranked as the fifth-largest economy in the world at the end of 2023. The state's economy is diversified, with sectors such as technology, commerce, entertainment, manufacturing, government, tourism, construction, and services. Texas, on the other hand, relies heavily on key industries, including oil and gas, chemical production, and technology equipment manufacturing. California's Silicon Valley and access to venture capital and a large pool of tech workers make it an attractive destination for technology investment. Texas's infrastructure, including its ports and extensive network of roads, highways, and railroads, adds to its appeal. Additionally, the state's strong business ecosystem and proximity to Mexico make it an attractive location for multinational companies looking to expand into the North American market.

**Six Mexican States Lead Economic Growth in Second Quarter 2024**

These states were Oaxaca, with a 5.1% increase; Durango, with a 3.8% increase; Coahuila and Baja California, with a 3.5% increase each; and Guerrero, with a 2.8% increase. In contrast, the states that recorded the largest declines in economic activity were Tabasco, with a 3.3% decrease; Campeche, with a 3.2% decrease; Hidalgo, with a 2.5% decrease; Sinaloa, with a 1.4% decrease; and the Mexico City, with a 0.7% decrease. At an annual rate, the states with the most growth were Durango, with a 7.7% growth; Colima, with a 6.8% growth; Oaxaca, with a 6.0% growth; Quintana Roo, with a 5.9% growth; Yucatán, with a 4.1% growth; and Zacatecas, with a 4.1% growth.

**California is losing more workers than any other state**
California is experiencing a net loss of workers at a faster rate than any other state, according to a new report by the National Association of Realtors (NAR). In the third quarter of 2023, nearly 87,000 professionals left the state for new career opportunities, surpassing job inflows of about 69,000. The most popular states for California workers to move to are Texas, Arizona, Washington, Nevada, and New York. The NAR attributed the exodus to high housing costs, high state income taxes, and a high cost of living. However, experts predict that the trend may shift in 2024 as companies adopt hybrid work arrangements and adjust salaries based on employee location. 'California's once-dominant appeal as the 'land of opportunity' is starting to erode as workers seek more sustainable living and working conditions elsewhere,' said Sam Taylor, a business consultant. California's cost-of-living is among the highest in the country, with rent costs alone exceeding 30 percent of a person's income in many cities. 'In contrast, states like Texas and Florida, which have lower housing costs, better job opportunities, and a more manageable lifestyle, are attracting these same workers, allowing them to stretch their income further while enjoying a lower-stress environment,' Taylor added.

**Illinois holds second-worst unemployment rate in the nation**
Illinois has the second-worst unemployment rate in the nation, tied with California at 5.3% in September 2024, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The state's unemployment rate exceeds the national average of 4.1% and is higher than any neighboring state. Illinois saw job growth of 35,400 since September 2023, but this growth rate ranked 47th among all states at 0.58%. The state's slow economic growth and high unemployment are attributed to an unfriendly business environment resulting from high taxes and a constantly mismanaged budget. Illinois has the highest state and local tax burden in the Midwest and levies the second-highest corporate income tax in the nation. To improve its economic situation, Illinois must focus on strengthening its fiscal position, removing regulatory burdens, and providing real tax relief to workers and job creators.
