**Temer: Brazil Not Prepared for 4-Day Workweek**
Former President Michel Temer stated on Monday (25) that Brazil is not prepared for a 4-day workweek and 3-day weekend schedule. He believes that Brazilians are not concerned about this and that people would look for another job to occupy the three days off. Temer said, 'I think Brazil is not yet prepared for this [4-day workweek]. It's not possible. I remember in 1997, 1998, when I was first president of the Chamber, there was a movement to reduce working hours from 44 to 40 hours. It lasted almost a year, but didn't work out. I even proposed reducing it to 42 hours, but it wasn't possible.' According to Temer, the measure would be 'unhelpful' for the national business sector, as it would heavily burden companies. He also stated, 'This 4-day workweek won't work in Brazil. I don't think it's the right time to think about it. I don't even think workers are concerned about it. If it happens, I think workers will find another job for the other three days,' Temer said.

**The 6x1 Workday: A Disguised Slave Regime that Affects Women**
The proposal to end the 6x1 workday has gained attention in Brazil, after a growing pressure on social media and organized protests by social movements. The proposal was finally sent to the National Congress. However, the reality is that the 6x1 workday should have been abolished much earlier. The 6x1 workday is a disguised slave regime that takes away the fundamental right of workers to have a healthy, balanced, and dignified life. There is no time for self-care, studying, resting, hobbies, or even being with family. This workload overload is not just a matter of time, but of quality of life. The arguments that eliminating this model would compromise the economy are false, just like the case of the CLT or the 13th salary. According to IBGE data, around 11 million single mothers live in Brazil, who often have to work incessantly to support their children, but end up not being able to offer the attention and care that children need. This problem is even more serious for single mothers, who represent a significant portion of women in Brazil. The PEC that puts an end to the 6x1 workday is not just a change in the work regime, but an opportunity to reverse a structure of exploitation and ensure that women can seek a balance between their professional and personal lives. Quality of life should be the priority, not excessive work. This is a cause that involves the entire society, but directly affects women, who have been overloaded with the double workday.

**Brazil Postpones New Rules on Sunday and Holiday Work in Commerce Sector**
The Brazilian government has announced the postponement of new rules on working on Sundays and holidays in the commerce sector, originally planned for 2024, to 2025. The decision highlights the challenges of balancing the demands of employers, workers, and union representatives in a context where the 2021 norm, which exempted union intervention, generated controversy. The extension of the implementation deadline emphasizes the importance of dialogue and articulation among the different stakeholders to promote legislation that is fair to all sectors. The new rules aim to provide workers with more rest and time for their personal lives, which may result in higher job satisfaction and lower absenteeism rates. However, they may also increase costs for companies, particularly those that rely on weekend and holiday work, and require restructuring of operations. The implementation of the new rules is expected to intensify negotiations between unions and companies, seeking to find a balance between workers' rights and business needs.

**Gisela Simona Supports PEC Vida Além do Trabalho, Advocates for Broad Debate**
Federal Deputy Gisela Simona (União Brasil) supports the PEC Vida Além do Trabalho, which aims to end the 6x1 work schedule and replace it with a 4x3 schedule. She advocates for a broad debate with the Federal Government, parliamentarians, the business sector, industries, and workers to find a 'middle ground'. According to Simona, the current 6x1 model is 'exhausting' for Brazilians, but any change must be carefully considered to avoid harming the country's economy. She suggests that a 5x2 schedule might be more acceptable, but notes that any reduction in working hours must be balanced with measures to avoid negative impacts on businesses and employment. 'We need to find a way for Brazil to find the best solution,' Simona said. 'The 6x1 schedule is exhausting, but there's a fear that a 4x3 schedule could burden businesses and lead to unemployment, which we don't want.' The proposal has been criticized by right-wing parliamentarians, who see it as an attempt to 'lock in' and gain national visibility. Simona believes that the PEC will undergo adjustments to avoid any imbalance and that discussions may drag on.

**Brazilian Workers Demand a Shorter Workweek: A Proposal to Abolish the 6x1 Schedule**
A proposed constitutional amendment (PEC) by federal deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL-SP) aims to abolish the 6x1 work schedule, which consists of six days of work and one day of rest. The PEC has already gathered the required number of signatures and will begin to be processed in the Chamber of Deputies. Some economists, such as Pedro Gomes, professor of economics at the University of London, argue that a four-day workweek would be more beneficial for the economy. However, many business leaders and politicians are opposed to the proposal, citing concerns that it would increase costs and lead to job losses. Supporters of the PEC, including Luiz Marinho, Minister of Labor and Employment, argue that the current 6x1 schedule is 'cruel' and that a shorter workweek would improve the lives of workers. 'It's a text that will bring dignity and quality of life to Brazilian workers,' said Erika Hilton. 'The truth is that there is a lot of economic value in leisure time,' added Pedro Gomes.

**Proposal to End 6x1 Work Schedule in Brazil**
A proposal to end the 6x1 work schedule, which consists of six days of work and one day of rest, has been put forward by federal deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL-SP). The proposal, which is based on an initiative from the Movimento Vida Além do Trabalho (VAT), aims to abolish the current 44-hour workweek, which has been in place since the 1988 Constitution. This is a reduction from the 48-hour workweek that was in place from 1943 to 1988, as established by the Consolidação das Leis do Trabalho (CLT). According to Hilton, 'the measure proposes to end the 6x1 work schedule, which has been in place for decades.'

**Brazilian Protesters Demand End to 6x1 Work Schedule**
Protesters in various cities across Brazil, including São Paulo, Brasília, Manaus, Fortaleza, Rio de Janeiro, and Recife, demanded an end to the 6x1 work schedule on Friday (15/11). The protests were organized by the Movimento Vida Além do Trabalho (VAT) and have gathered nearly 3 million signatures in an online petition in support of the change. The proposed amendment to the Constitution (PEC) suggests a maximum 36-hour workweek and four days of work per week. So far, 134 deputies have signed the proposal, which aims to end the 6x1 schedule. According to Priscila Araújo Kashimira, leader of the movement, the 6x1 schedule hinders young people's ability to balance work and studies, limiting access to higher education institutions.

**Brazilian Workers Demand End to 6x1 Work Schedule**
The Vida Além do Trabalho (VAT) movement, founded by Rick Azevedo, organized protests across Brazil on November 15, 2024, demanding the end of the 6x1 work schedule. The protests were held in various cities, including Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Brasília. In her speech, Rick Azevedo stated, 'The 6x1 work schedule is a slave-like, inhumane, exploitative system that ends the lives of workers, especially mothers.' Erika Hilton, a PSol deputy, emphasized the importance of the movement, saying, 'The struggle of the worker will bring down the 6x1 schedule in this country. It's not the politicians who will make this change, it's the workers.' The movement aims to reduce the work schedule to 36 hours a week without salary reduction and has already gained support from various politicians and social movements.

**Prohibiting the 6x1 work schedule is good for the country? YES**
A debate about ending the 6x1 work schedule (six consecutive days of work followed by one day of rest) has mobilized millions of workers in Brazil. The proposal, led by federal deputy Luiza Erundina (PSOL-SP), aims to eliminate the exploitative model of work and has gained support from over 230 deputies. A petition organized by Rick Azevedo's Movimento Vida Além do Trabalho (VAT) has reached nearly 3 million signatures. According to a DataSenado survey, 51% of the population supports reducing the workday to four days without salary loss, and 67% see the relationship between quality of life and salaries as a major challenge. The proposal aims to address the unsustainable model of work that has led to financial losses of R$ 13 billion per year due to work-related accidents. Opponents argue that the reduction of the workday would negatively affect small and medium-sized employers, but Erundina argues that this is a 'purely economic' view that ignores the real impact on workers' lives, health, and professionalization.

**Brazilian Protesters Demand End to 6x1 Work Schedule**
Protesters across the country gathered on Friday, November 15, to demand an end to the 6x1 work schedule, which consists of six days of work and one day of rest. The protests were called by the Movimento Vida Além do Trabalho (VAT) in support of a proposed amendment to the Constitution, which would limit the workweek to 36 hours and four days. The proposal, led by Deputy Erika Hilton, has gained traction, with over 3 million signatures collected online. According to the VAT, the current 6x1 schedule is a major cause of physical and mental exhaustion among workers, as well as hindering their ability to spend time with family and friends, engage in physical activities, or pursue hobbies. With the added pressure from the protests, the number of deputies who have signed the proposal has increased from 60 to 134 in just one week. Priscila Araújo Kashimira, a leader of the protest, emphasized that young people are particularly affected by the 6x1 schedule, as it makes it difficult for them to balance work and studies. She also shared how the schedule has impacted her own relationship with her mother, who was also present at the protest.

**Brazilian Protesters Demand End of 6x1 Work Schedule**
Protesters gathered in Cuiabá, Brazil, on November 15, 2024, to demand the end of the 6x1 work schedule. The event was part of a nationwide movement, with similar protests taking place in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte. The 6x1 schedule, which involves working six days a week, has been widely discussed in Brazil since a proposal to reduce the workweek to 36 hours without reducing salaries was presented by federal deputy Erika Hilton. According to Erika, 194 parliamentarians have signed the proposal, but it still needs to be approved by the Comissão de Constituição, Justiça e de Cidadania (CCJ) and the Plenário da Câmara. 'We need to work together to make this happen,' said Erika. 'It's not just about reducing the workweek, it's about improving the quality of life for workers.'

**Brazilian Workers Demand End of 6x1 Work Schedule**
On Friday, November 15, several cities in Brazil will hold protests to demand the end of the 6x1 work schedule, which requires six consecutive days of work for only one day of rest. The mobilization is led by the Movimento Vida Além do Trabalho (VAT), created by elected councilor Rick Azevedo (PSOL-RJ), and aims to support the Proposed Constitutional Amendment (PEC) that seeks to transform the work model in Brazil, allowing for a shorter and more balanced workday. According to Márcio Ayer, president of the Sindicato dos Comerciários do Rio de Janeiro, the end of the 6x1 schedule is necessary for the dignity and health of workers. 'The 6x1 schedule is incompatible with the dignity of workers, as it does not allow any possibility of balance between work, personal life, rest, and self-care,' he said. Adilson Araújo, president of the Central dos Trabalhadores e Trabalhadoras do Brasil (CTB), emphasizes that the end of the 6x1 schedule and the reduction of the weekly workday can bring significant benefits to the economy and society as a whole. 'This is a strategic objective that stimulates the economy, increases work productivity, and reduces the incidence of occupational diseases such as burnout,' he said. Experiences from other countries, such as the United Kingdom, show that a shorter workweek can be a viable solution for Brazil. 'We have seen that healthier and happier workers are more productive, which generates a virtuous cycle for the entire economy,' said Ayer. Erika Hilton highlights that the proposal seeks a four-day workweek, which, according to her, 'reflects a global movement towards more flexible work models for workers, recognizing the need to adapt to new market realities and demands for better quality of life for workers and their families.'

The debate on social media has been about the PEC (Proposta de Emenda à Constituição) to ban the 6×1 work schedule. On November 13, 2024, the first step was taken with the 171 valid signatures, starting the process in the Câmara dos Deputados. Erika Hilton, the author of the PEC, said, 'Estamos na ofensiva. Mas a nossa luta apenas começou.' (We are on the offensive. But our fight has just begun.) The proposal aims to reduce the number of working days per week, and alternative schedules are being studied, including the 5×2 and 4×3 schedules, which are viable under Brazilian labor law. The 4×3 schedule is valid in countries such as: [no specific countries are mentioned in the article]. The PEC has received little more than a hundred 'yes' votes, and the popular pressure has been a significant factor in changing the course of the vote.

**Celebrities Weigh in on the Proposed End of the 6x1 Work Schedule in Brazil**
The proposal to end the 6x1 work schedule, which requires a day off every six days of work, has been presented to the Brazilian Congress by federal deputy Erika Hilton. The proposal has gained support from several celebrities and influencers, including Luana Piovani, Jade Picon, Carlinhos Maia, Felipe Neto, and Valesca Popozuda. Luana Piovani stated, 'It's impossible that people who are rich don't have empathy, compassion, and generosity towards those who are not.' Jade Picon said, 'I believe that everyone has the right to a more dignified life, with leisure time, mental health, and balance.' Carlinhos Maia emphasized, 'No one is a slave to anyone, and employers need to understand that a happy employee is a productive one.' Felipe Neto criticized the Minister of Labor's stance on the issue, saying, 'It's shameful to wash your hands and say that this should be treated in conventions and agreements.' Valesca Popozuda stated, 'This schedule is detrimental to any human being's quality of life and mental health.' She also added, 'Those who are against the end of the 6x1 schedule should try working on Saturdays and Sundays for minimum wage and bringing their lunch from home.' The proposal has already gained over 200 signatures and is awaiting a vote in Congress.

**End of 6x1 work schedule? PEC proposes 4-day workweek and 36-hour limit**
A proposal to end the 6x1 work schedule, where employees have only one day off, has been debated on social media, from Twitter to Instagram, and LinkedIn. However, this is not the only common work schedule in the Brazilian labor market today. The change in the weekly work schedule is proposed in a Constitutional Amendment Bill (PEC) initiated by federal deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL-SP), who adopted the banner of the Vida Além do Trabalho (VAT) movement, which gained strength on social media last year. The VAT was founded by Rick Azevedo, elected city councilor in Rio. The text suggests adopting a four-day workweek and reducing the legal limit of 44 hours of weekly work to 36 hours, without changing the maximum daily load of eight hours and without reducing salaries. Maria Lucia Benhame, a labor law attorney and specialist in Labor Law, explains that the 6x1 schedule mainly affects workers in the commerce and some service sectors, such as hotels, bars, and restaurants, with a 7h20 workday in six days and one day off. According to data from the General Registry of Employees and Unemployed (Caged), there are 10.5 million workers in the commerce sector alone, the second-largest employer in the country. However, in other sectors, there are specific schedules. The attorney details that in the industry, for example, schedules have become increasingly 'creative': 'I've seen factories with weekly schedules that alternate, with 6x3, 6x2, and 6x1, for example. And in the logistics sector, there are cases of 4x4 schedules, at the demand of the workers themselves.' In other sectors, the schedule is not by day, but by hours worked. This is the case of healthcare workers or security services, who often work 12 hours and have 36 hours off.

**Zema calls 6x1 work schedule discussion 'a waste of time'**
Minas Gerais Governor Romeu Zema stated that the discussion about the 6x1 work schedule, which may be debated in the Brazilian Congress, is 'a waste of time' and 'dispensable'. Zema emphasized the importance of free negotiation between employers and employees, saying that the country is one of the most regulated in this regard. He also stated that 'nobody is forced to marry, to tolerate things they don't agree with. You should have contracts, case by case.' Zema believes that responsible people who fulfill their contracts are what matters, not laws. This statement follows the liberal economic line of his party. The discussion about the 6x1 work schedule has gained momentum in Brazil, particularly with the 'Vida Além do Trabalho' (Life Beyond Work) movement, which criticizes the schedule for causing exhaustion and affecting workers' health and well-being. The movement proposes more time off for workers to rest, have leisure time, spend time with family, and take care of their health. The proposal aims to abolish the 6x1 schedule and reduce the maximum working hours from 44 to 36 hours per week, with a four-day workweek.

**Brazil's '6x1' Work Schedule Under Fire as Proposals for 36-Hour Workweek Gain Momentum**
The '6x1' work schedule, where employees work 6 days a week and have 1 day off, has been a topic of debate in Brazil. The Vida Além do Trabalho (VAT) movement has been pushing for the end of this schedule, and a proposal for a 36-hour workweek with 4 days off has been presented to the National Congress. The proposal, presented by Deputy Erika Hilton, has gained 134 signatures in just one week, and is now close to the 171 signatures needed to begin the legislative process. The proposal aims to reduce the workload and improve the quality of life for employees, who are often forced to work long hours without adequate rest. Deputy Reginaldo Lopes has also presented a similar proposal, which would reduce the workweek from 44 to 36 hours over a period of 10 years. The debate around the 6x1 schedule has been ongoing for years, with some arguing that it is a form of 'prison' for workers, while others argue that it is necessary for the economy. The Central Única dos Trabalhadores (CUT) and the Central dos Sindicatos Brasileiros (CSB) have been advocating for the reduction of the workweek to 40 hours, while the Confederação Nacional do Comércio de Bens, Serviços e Turismo (CNC) has expressed concerns about the potential impact on businesses. 'The imposition of a reduction in working hours without a corresponding reduction in salaries will directly affect the operational costs of companies,' said the CNC. Deputy Amom Mandel has expressed concerns that the end of the 6x1 schedule could harm the economy, but is open to being convinced otherwise. 'The proposal is not for the end of the 6x1 schedule, but for the establishment of a 4-day workweek,' he said. '80% of formal jobs in Brazil come from micro or small businesses, my people.' Minister of Labor and Employment Luiz Marinho has defended the idea of treating the 6x1 schedule in collective bargaining agreements, where employers and workers negotiate the terms of the contract. 'The ministry considers that a reduction in working hours to 40 hours per week is fully possible and healthy, when resulting from collective decision-making,' he said. 'The MTE has been following the debate closely and understands that this is a topic that requires the involvement of all sectors in a detailed and in-depth discussion, considering the specific needs of each area.'

**Alckmin says 6x1 work schedule reduction is 'a trend worldwide'**
Brazilian Vice President Geraldo Alckmin stated that the reduction in the 6x1 work schedule, with six days of work and one day of rest, is 'a trend worldwide'. Alckmin made this comment during a press conference after speaking at the COP 29 in Baku, Azerbaijan. He noted that 'As technology advances, you can do more with fewer people and have a shorter workday'. However, Alckmin emphasized that the Brazilian government has not yet discussed the proposal to abolish the 6x1 schedule. He also stated that 'this is a debate that belongs to society and the Parliament', without clarifying whether the government will support or oppose the proposal made by federal deputy Erika Hilton, which aims to reduce the weekly working hours from 44 to 36. The proposal has already gained the support of 134 federal deputies, out of the 171 needed to move forward in the legislative process.

**Brazilian Deputies Push for End to 6x1 Work Schedule**
A proposed amendment to the Brazilian Constitution (PEC) to end the 6x1 work schedule has gained 134 signatures from federal deputies. The proposal, led by Erika Hilton (PSOL), aims to reduce the weekly work hours from 44 to 36 hours, without changing the 8-hour daily schedule. This would provide more quality of life and balance between personal and professional life for workers. The PEC has already gathered more than half of the necessary signatures, with notable signatories including Tabata Amaral (PSB-SP), André Janones (Avante-MG), and Duda Salabert (PDT-MG). According to Tabata Amaral, she decided to sign the proposal after discussing it with her team, saying, 'Before signing or presenting any project, I analyze with my team its economic and social impacts. It's my way of working, and it wasn't different with the PEC against the 6x1 scale.' André Janones emphasized the need for more deputies to sign the PEC, stating, 'The 6x1 scale is anti-human. People stop existing, they don't have a day to go to the cinema, read a book, dedicate themselves to their family, play with their children, or walk a dog. Life becomes working to exist, and existence becomes work.' Duda Salabert also called for the end of the 6x1 scale and more dignity for workers, saying, 'I was one of the first parliamentarians to sign the PEC to end the 6x1 shift because I believe that human dignity should come before profit. In the current scale, the worker has only 1 day of rest per week. This is unacceptable.'

**Proposal to Change 6x1 Work Schedule Gains Momentum in Brazil**
A proposal to change the 6x1 work schedule (six days of work and one day of rest per week) has gained momentum in Brazil. The proposal, presented by Erika Hilton (PSOL-SP) on May 1st, aims to end the 6x1 schedule and adopt a 36-hour workweek, divided into four days. The proposal has the support of over 130 parliamentarians, but still needs 171 signatures from the 513 members of the House to move forward. The proposal would alter Article 7 of the Constitution, which currently limits the workweek to 44 hours. The change would allow for shorter workweeks and more days off, as seen in other countries. However, the proposal faces resistance from some sectors. According to Marcos Vinícius Nascimento, a lawyer, the proposal could increase employability but also burden employers with more formal employment costs. 'It increases employability, but may burden the employer, who will have more charges with formal employment,' he said. The list of parliamentarians who have signed the proposal includes members from various parties, such as PSOL, PT, PCdoB, PDT, PSB, PV, and UNIÃO.

**Bolsonaro Family Rejects End of 6x1 Work Schedule, but Supports Eternal Rest for Themselves**
The Bolsonaro family and the PL (Liberal Party) bloc have rejected the end of the 6x1 work schedule, calling it a 'threat' to Brazilian tradition. They argue that the 6-day workweek and 1-day rest schedule is what keeps the country on track. However, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who refuses to support the proposed amendment by Erika Hilton, seems to support a lighter work schedule for himself and his family, the 0x365, a lifestyle with eternal rest - except for the 'hard work' of destroying the country, according to his critics.

**Brazilian Proposal to End 6x1 Work Schedule Sparks Debate**
A proposal to end the 6x1 work schedule, which allows for six days of work followed by one day of rest, has been gaining attention in Brazil. The proposal, introduced by federal deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL-SP), aims to modify the Constitution to establish a maximum of 8 hours of work per day and 36 hours per week, distributed over four days. This would effectively end the 6x1 schedule. The proposal has been met with both support and opposition, with some arguing that it would improve working conditions and productivity, while others claim it would lead to job losses and increased costs for businesses. The proposal is currently in the process of collecting signatures and has not yet been voted on by Congress.

**Brazil's 6x1 Work Schedule Under Fire: A Proposal to End the Exploitation**
The 'Vida Além do Trabalho' (VAT) movement has been pushing for the end of the 6-day workweek and 1-day weekend, known as the 6x1 schedule. The movement has gained traction, with 134 lawmakers signing a proposal to amend the Constitution and establish a maximum 36-hour workweek and 4-day workweek in Brazil. The proposal, led by Deputy Erika Hilton, aims to end the 6x1 schedule, which she argues is a form of 'prison' that takes away workers' right to spend time with their families, care for themselves, and pursue other opportunities. The proposal has received support from labor unions, but has also faced criticism from business groups and some lawmakers, who argue that it would increase costs and harm the economy. The proposal needs 171 signatures to move forward in the Chamber of Deputies and 308 votes to pass in two rounds of voting. 'This is a matter of dignity for workers,' said Erika Hilton. 'The 6x1 schedule is a form of exploitation that affects the quality of life of employees, compromising their health, well-being, and family relationships,' added the petition online. 'It's time for the country to adopt a 4x3 or 5x2 model, without reducing salaries,' said Deputy Reginaldo Lopes. 'The 6x1 schedule is a prison, and it's incompatible with the dignity of workers,' argued Erika Hilton. 'The reduction of the workday to 40 hours is possible and healthy when it results from collective decision-making,' said Minister Luiz Marinho.

**Proposal to End 6x1 Schedule Sparks Debate**
A proposal by federal deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL-SP) to end the 6x1 schedule, which allows for six days of work and one day of rest per week, has sparked controversy on social media. The intention is to replace the current 44-hour weekly schedule with 36 hours, resulting in four days of nine hours or five days of 7.2 hours. According to Hilton, the reason for the difference in productivity between Brazilians and Americans is not due to the Brazilians being better, but rather the quality of education. 'It is because they are better? No, it is because of the quality of education,' Hilton said.

**Brazilian Proposal Aims to End 6x1 Work Schedule and Improve Workers' Quality of Life**
A proposal to end the 6x1 work schedule, which requires workers to work six days a week and have one day off, has gained momentum in Brazil. The proposal, led by the VAT (Vida Além do Trabalho) movement, aims to reduce the workweek to four days and three days off, without affecting salaries or benefits. The proposal, presented by federal deputy Érika Hilton (PSOL-SP), has already been signed by 71 of 513 deputies, and needs the support of 171 deputies and 27 senators to be presented to Congress. According to the proposal, the change aims to provide Brazilian workers with more time off and improve their quality of life, without compromising salaries and benefits. The VAT movement has mobilized public support through a petition, which has already gathered over 1.3 million signatures. 'It is well known that the workweek in Brazil often exceeds reasonable limits, with the 6x1 work schedule being one of the main causes of physical and mental exhaustion of workers. The abusive work hours imposed by this work schedule negatively affect the quality of life of employees, compromising their health, well-being, and family relationships,' said the petition. The 6x1 work schedule is widely used in sectors that operate every day, such as commerce, supermarkets, and pharmacies. The proposal aims to align the workweek in Brazil with more modern models adopted in other countries, where the weekly rest period is longer.
