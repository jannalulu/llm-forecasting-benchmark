**No Hope for Lithium Price Recovery in 2025: Why**
Despite recent signs of recovery in the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) market, driven by government intervention and targeted economic policies, the global lithium market remains in a state of surplus. This has significant implications for the industry internationally. The local prices of lithium carbonate in China have increased both on the spot market and in futures, but the global lithium market remains in surplus.

**Lithium Carbonate Demand Disagreement Remains**
The demand for lithium carbonate in December has been relatively stable, with prices rising. However, the market's visibility for future demand is low, leaving room for lithium prices to fluctuate. In the current environment of a non-dormant demand season, it is recommended to hold long positions cautiously. The current spot price of battery-grade lithium carbonate has risen to 7.54 yuan/ton. The production volume of lithium carbonate in China last week increased by 742 tons to 14,507 tons. The CIF prices of lithium spodumene concentrate from Australia and Brazil have risen by $45 and $65 per ton, respectively, to $845 and $840 per ton. The prices of domestic lithium spodumene concentrate with 5-5.5% Li2O content have increased by 300 yuan/ton, while the prices of domestic lithium mica concentrate with 2.0-2.5% Li2O content have increased by 85 yuan/ton. The profit margins of smelting (purchasing spodumene) and smelting (purchasing mica) have remained neutral, increasing by 694 yuan/ton and 1622 yuan/ton, respectively. The profit margins of 523-type ternary materials and 811-type ternary materials have decreased by 1800 yuan/ton and 225 yuan/ton, respectively. The production rates of ternary materials have decreased to 47.37%. The inventory of smelting plants has decreased by 1598 tons to 34,152 tons, and the total inventory (including warehouse receipts) has decreased by 1670 tons to 1,090,530 tons.

**Have lithium prices bottomed yet?**
The price of lithium carbonate has fallen by 88% from its peak in November 2022, from CNY 597,500 to CNY 72,500. The top 5 lithium-producing countries are Australia, Chile, China, Argentina, and Brazil. In 2024, production levels in Canada are estimated to be 3,400 metric tons, which is just under 2% of global supply. The demand for lithium is expected to increase due to the growth of Electric Vehicle (EV) sales, from 10 million units in 2022 to a projected 17 million units this year. The International Energy Agency sees sales of 30 million units in 2025 and 70 million units in 2030. Research into alternative battery technologies, such as sodium-ion and solid-state batteries, could reduce lithium demand. The pricing outlook for 2025 and 2026 is between US$11,000 and US$20,000, and for 2030, it is between US$10,000 and US$15,000. Recent lower prices have caused issues, with Arcadium Lithium pausing investment in two of its expansion projects. Lithium stock prices have risen off their lows but are still down 70% or more since all-time highs.

**Lithium Carbonate Long-Term Contract Price May Increase Amid Market Rumors and Overseas Mining Reductions**
Market rumors suggest that Sichuan has held a meeting to discuss increasing the price of lithium carbonate long-term contracts. According to a report by Green Futures, major manufacturers are planning to renegotiate their long-term contracts, aiming to reduce the proportion of long-term contracts and increase the proportion of spot and warehouse deals. A representative from Salt Lake Shares stated that there was indeed a meeting, but it was 'more like an annual conference' organized by the industry association. The representative also stated that the price of lithium carbonate is influenced by multiple market factors, and other factors have little impact. Regarding long-term contract prices, the representative stated that they do not sign long-term contracts, and currently, few lithium carbonate producers sign long-term contracts, resulting in large price fluctuations. Representatives from Yaxing Group and Shengxin Lithium Industry stated that they were not aware of the meeting and did not receive any information about the potential price increase. Overseas mining companies have announced plans to reduce production, with Australian mines reducing their lithium spodumene production expectations for 2025. In addition, the price of battery-grade lithium carbonate has risen by 6.6% from November 1 to November 15, driven by strong demand and supply. The price of lithium carbonate futures has also risen, with the main contract closing at 82,500 yuan/ton on November 20, up 0.67% from the previous day. According to SMM statistics, the current inventory of lithium carbonate is 109,100 tons, with 34,200 tons in refining factories, 29,500 tons in downstream companies, and 45,400 tons in other storage. The inventory pressure on lithium salt factories is not significant, and there is a possibility of small-scale stockpiling or purchasing in the downstream market, which may lead to a short-term price increase. On the supply side, some overseas mining companies have announced plans to reduce production, which has raised concerns about the potential reduction in mineral resources. The domestic cloud mica lithium industry is facing challenges due to a lack of raw materials and the shutdown of major enterprises, resulting in a low operating rate. The production of salt lake lithium has been weakened due to winter-related issues with brine and freshwater usage. On the cost side, the downstream production situation has been good, and the upstream lithium salt factories have been price-competitive, with overseas mines also showing a strong price-competitive trend. The demand side has been driven by the implementation of the 'old-for-new' policy, the car manufacturers' year-end rush, and the increased demand for positive materials from battery manufacturers. The main energy storage field has also entered a peak delivery period, and the demand for next year has been pre-positioned, resulting in a 'slow season' phenomenon. However, the demand has exceeded expectations, with some manufacturers stockpiling materials due to the upcoming subsidy reduction, some due to the Spring Festival holiday, and some due to the year-end surge and the implementation of the new policy before it takes effect. This may lead to a depletion of next year's demand.

**Morning Paper's Debt Crisis and Lithium Carbonate Price Surge**
Morning Paper, a leading paper company, has announced that its debt has reached 18.2 billion yuan, accounting for 10.91% of its net assets. The company's main products, such as white cardboard, have seen a significant decline in prices, leading to severe losses. To reduce losses, the company has implemented production cuts and shutdowns, with 71.7% of its production capacity suspended. The company's chairman, Chen Hongguo, has resigned after 37 years of service, and his wife, Li Xueqin, has also resigned as vice president. The company's stock price has fallen to 3.78 yuan per share, with a total market value of 110.58 billion yuan. In contrast, the price of lithium carbonate has continued to rise, with the futures price increasing by 3.96% to 82650 yuan. Industry insiders attribute the rapid rebound in lithium carbonate prices to the fact that social inventory has entered a destocking cycle, and lithium salt factories and material factories have low inventory levels, with a demand for replenishment. According to a report by Zhongjin Securities, the lithium battery industry is expected to experience a supply-demand reversal in the second quarter of 2025, with domestic demand exceeding expectations, with 1.3 million new energy vehicles expected to be sold in 2024, a 36% increase from the previous year.

**Lithium Carbonate Prices Surge Amidst Shortage and Growing Demand**
The lithium carbonate market has seen a surge in prices, with a 10% increase in the past month. The price of lithium carbonate has risen from 72,000 yuan/ton to 79,200 yuan/ton. The increase is attributed to the shutdown of a lithium mine in Australia, which has led to a shortage of lithium carbonate. Additionally, the development of new energy vehicles has increased demand for lithium carbonate, leading to a surge in prices. According to Ningde Times, the company has successfully completed a trial run of lithium battery transportation by rail, which is expected to increase efficiency and reduce costs. The company believes that this development will further promote the growth of the lithium battery industry and contribute to the development of new energy vehicles. 'This is a significant milestone for the development of the lithium battery industry in China,' said an analyst. 'It will further drive the growth of the industry and promote the development of new energy vehicles.'

**Chinese Commodity Market Rises on November 19, Led by Lithium Carbonate**
The Chinese commodity market rose on November 19, with most varieties closing up, led by a 4% increase in lithium carbonate prices. Other commodities such as oil, urea, silver, asphalt, SC crude oil, low-sulfur fuel oil, and gold also rose by over 2%. However, a few varieties fell, including soda ash, which fell by over 1%. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 16.85 points, or 1.21%, to 1408.34.57. The China Securities Index rose 23.01 points, or 1.21%, to 1923.85. According to Shanghai Nonferrous Network (SMM), the upcoming materials procurement will drive the lithium price to continue its rebound. However, the market still expects a long-term oversupply of lithium, which will limit its price rebound. The international oil price rebounded overnight, boosting the domestic oil and gas sector. SC crude oil rose by over 2% to end its five consecutive days of decline. The demand for lithium is expected to be strong in the short term, but the market still expects a long-term oversupply of lithium. The gold and silver prices rose by over 2% to close above 610 yuan/ct and 7800 yuan/ct, respectively. The soda ash price fell by over 1% due to weak demand and oversupply in the market.

**Electric Device Industry: Australian Mine Shutdowns and Exceeding Lithium Battery Production in December**
The electric device industry is experiencing a surge in demand due to the combination of Australian mine shutdowns and exceeding lithium battery production in December. The price of lithium carbonate has risen. In November, Australian mines frequently reported shutdowns, including Pilbara's decision to close the Nungaju mining and processing plant, which reduced FY25 production guidance from 820,000 tons to 720,000 tons, and BaldHill's 150,000 tons of lithium concentrate production capacity shutdown. Additionally, lithium battery materials exceeded production expectations in December, with supply and demand both favorable, resulting in a 6.6% increase in battery-grade lithium carbonate prices from November 1 to November 15.

**Lithium Carbonate Prices Surge 5% as Demand and Supply Dynamics Shift**
On November 19, the main contract of lithium carbonate opened high by about 2%, and then surged by over 5% during the day, closing at a 3.96% gain. Lithium mining stocks also followed the trend, with Tianqi Lithium, Rongke Shares, and Ganfeng Lithium among others hitting the daily limit. According to Shanghai Nonferrous Metals Network, the SMM battery-grade lithium carbonate price reached 78,513 yuan/ton, up 301 yuan/ton from the previous working day. The battery-grade lithium carbonate price range was 77,200-80,300 yuan/ton, with an average price of 78,750 yuan/ton, up 300 yuan/ton from the previous working day. The industrial-grade lithium carbonate price range was 74,750-75,500 yuan/ton, with an average price of 75,250 yuan/ton, up 400 yuan/ton from the previous working day. Shanghai Nonferrous Metals Network attributed the price increase to the current demand-driven stimulus and the overseas news of a mine reduction in production. A research report by East Money Futures on November 17 stated that the Australian Bald Hill lithium mine's planned maintenance and reduced 2025 shipment volume drove the lithium price surge, but domestic supply remains in surplus, with high inventory levels making it difficult for prices to maintain a strong upward trend. In terms of fundamentals, the lithium carbonate weekly production rate rebounded slightly, remaining at an absolute high level, while salt lake production continued to decline. Phosphate iron lithium production may continue to rise in November, while ternary materials may decline slightly. Overall, demand remains resilient, although inventory continues to decline, remaining at an absolute high level. However, the overall supply elasticity remains good, with no factors driving prices to continue rising. Downstream consumption is good, but not enough to drive prices to continue rising. It is expected that prices will remain within the range and continue to fluctuate. An industry insider also stated, 'Lithium carbonate is unlikely to break through the previous high point, unless a new supply disruption occurs. However, the overall price center will shift upward.'

**Lithium Carbonate Prices Soar as Industry Sees Supply-Demand Reversal**
The lithium carbonate main contract surged by 4% intraday, closing at 82,700 yuan/ton. According to a report by CITIC Securities, the lithium battery industry is expected to experience a supply-demand reversal for the first time in three years in the second quarter of 2025. Domestic demand for electric vehicles is better than expected, with a predicted 13 million units sold in 2024, a 36% increase year-over-year. With the 'trade-in for new' subsidy driving sales, the forecast for 2025 is 15.6 million units, a 20% increase year-over-year. Additionally, driven by a 50% increase in energy storage, the predicted demand for lithium battery installations in 2025 is 1.814 GWh, a 22% increase year-over-year. With supply-side prices having bottomed out after two years of decline, it is expected that the industry will see a supply-demand reversal by the end of the year and in the second quarter of 2025, entering a price stabilization phase.

**Lithium Price Begins to Recover, but Surplus Looms in 2025**
The price of lithium has started to recover due to the increase in demand for Chinese electric vehicles and cuts in supply. However, analysts warn that it is still likely that there will be a surplus of the metal for batteries in 2025. The spot prices of Chinese lithium carbonate have risen by around 8% since the end of October and are now at a three-month high. The futures prices on the Guangzhou exchange have risen by 13% so far this week. 'The expansion of Chinese subsidies to encourage people to change their old cars has helped the initial rebound of the metal, which is crucial for the energy transition. Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers are on track to meet ambitious annual sales targets, while inventory replenishment activity is picking up,' said Bloomberg. It is also speculated that the electoral victory of Donald Trump may encourage Chinese battery manufacturers to buy lithium before a possible trade war. 'The demand for lithium carbonate in November has been stronger than market expectations for a typically slow year-end season,' said China Futures Co analyst Zhang Weixin. The Chinese subsidies have served as an incentive and battery manufacturers are rushing to export before trade barriers are imposed, he explained. China's recent stimulus measures seem to have boosted consumer confidence, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights battery metals team director Leah Chen. 'Several cathode manufacturers have returned to the market to replenish inventories that have gradually decreased over the past few months,' she noted. On the supply side, a prolonged decline in the lithium market this year has led to mine closures or cost reductions in Australia, China, and other countries. It's worth noting that prices remain stagnant at levels that are less than a fifth of the peak at the end of 2022. According to CRU Group, 190,000 tonnes of lithium mine capacity have been reduced since the end of 2023, and 50,000 tonnes of projects have been delayed. As a result, the consultant reduced its supply forecast by 14% for next year, explained battery markets analyst Cameron Hughes.

**Lithium Prices Remain Low, Battery Cell Prices Continue to Fall**
Lithium prices remain low, while battery cell prices continue to fall. The spot price of battery-grade lithium carbonate was 72,000-75,000 RMB/TM as of October 31, with an average price of 73,000 RMB/TM, a 4.8% decrease from the previous month. The CIF price of Chinese lithium spodumene concentrate (SC6) was 735-790 USD/TM, averaging 763 USD/TM, a 4.1% decrease from the previous month. The price of battery-grade lithium carbonate failed to surpass the 80,000 RMB/TM threshold, hitting a low in early October. The price began to recover slightly as it approached 70,000 RMB/TM by the end of the month, with the monthly price range remaining at 70,000-79,000 RMB/TM. Influenced by the price of lithium carbonate, the average price of lithium spodumene concentrate (SC6) continued to fall, and upstream miners offered price concessions in the midst of market sentiment for low prices. Lithium prices fell below the early October threshold of USD 800 / TM and continued a slight decline. Lithium producers are trying to maintain prices, with a minimum cost of RMB 70,000 / TM for battery-grade lithium carbonate, limiting the decrease in the short term. As the high season for cathode material production and battery cell manufacturing comes to an end, downstream inventory accumulation intentions may weaken gradually. Given that it is unlikely that demand will sustain growth by the end of the year, the short-term increase in lithium prices does not see sufficient momentum. Although lepidolite producers have reduced production, lithium extraction from spodumene and brine continues to grow, limiting the overall impact on battery-grade lithium carbonate production. The supply of battery-grade lithium carbonate continues to increase, and the total supply remains higher than the current downstream demand. If the price of battery-grade lithium carbonate stabilizes at 70,000 RMB/TM, lower-grade mines may see more cuts or production interruptions due to cost considerations. However, as capacity elimination takes time, lithium carbonate prices will continue to hover around the minimum. By early November, the pressure of excess supply may hinder the rebound of battery-grade lithium carbonate prices. The downward trend of lithium spodumene concentrate prices will also affect lithium carbonate prices. Lithium carbonate prices will continue to face pressure with the subsequent commissioning of low-cost brine pool projects and may experience new declines. The average price of LFP cells in China has fallen to 0.03 RMB/Wh. LFP cell prices in China are still at a minimum in October. As of October 31, the price range after taxes for 280 Ah LFP cells was 0.25-0.35 RMB/Wh, with an average price of 0.30 RMB/Wh, a 3.2% decrease from the previous month. The price range for 314 Ah LFP cells was 0.26-0.35 RMB/Wh, with an average price of 0.31 RMB/Wh, a 6.2% decrease from the previous month. Most level 2 and level 3 cell manufacturers have seen their lowest prices for cells fall below 0.03 RMB/Wh. The price range after taxes for 100 Ah LFP cells was 0.31-0.37 RMB/Wh, with an average price of 0.34 RMB/Wh, a 1.4% decrease from the previous month, a decreasing gap. 314 Ah cells have been adopted in multiple energy storage projects. As production increases and demand grows, 314 Ah and 280 Ah cells do not see a price gap from the fourth quarter. By the end of January 2024, the average prices after taxes for 280 Ah and 100 Ah LFP cells were 0.42 RMB/Wh and 0.44 RMB/Wh, respectively, a decrease of nearly 29% compared to October, reflecting the fierce price war for LFP cells this year. Despite the lower costs of energy storage cells due to the decline in material costs and the improvement in production processes, some manufacturers' lower prices are approaching or below the current production costs of cells. Even without making a profit, they continue to try to secure orders for key projects that must be installed and connected to the grid by the end of the year. In the midst of price competition, downstream customers also pose increasingly stringent demands on delivery schedules, project performance, and product quality. In addition to seeking the lowest possible costs, cell manufacturers have begun to seek multifaceted developments, as reducing prices to secure orders may no longer be sustainable.

**Lithium Carbonate Price Falls 7.12% Amid High Inventory**
The price of lithium carbonate (LC2501) fell by 7.12% on November 15, closing at 78,300 yuan/ton. The current high inventory continues to suppress the upward space of the price. According to Mysteel data, the average price of battery-grade lithium carbonate on November 15 was 80,000 yuan/ton, down 2,000 yuan/ton from the previous trading day. Zhang Weixin, an analyst at Zhongsheng Jintou Futures, believes that the price of lithium carbonate has returned to its basic level, and the current high inventory continues to suppress the upward space of the price. Wu Jiang, an analyst at Guotai Anshin Futures, believes that the price of lithium carbonate has risen in line with the macro direction, but the current situation is not conducive to the continuation of the price rise. He believes that the price of lithium carbonate will still lack a sustained upward basis, and the price will likely be weak and volatile around 75,000 yuan/ton. Zhang Weixin also believes that the price of lithium carbonate will still lack a sustained upward basis, and the price will likely be weak and volatile around 75,000 yuan/ton. 'The price of lithium carbonate has risen to 85,000 yuan/ton, and the original cost support and supply out-clear logic no longer applies. If the price wants to maintain a high level, it must have demand growth as support, and the supply and demand relationship will only be slightly imbalanced or balanced.'

**Lithium in Nascent Rebound, But Long-Term Outlook Is Bleak – by Annie Lee (Bloomberg News – November 14, 2024)**
Lithium prices have seen a mini-revival due to increased demand from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers and supply cuts. Chinese lithium carbonate spot prices have risen 8% since late October, reaching a three-month high. Analysts caution that despite the uptick, there is still likely to be a surplus of lithium in 2025. The rebound is attributed to an expansion in Chinese subsidies encouraging people to trade in older cars, as well as speculation that Chinese battery makers are stockpiling lithium ahead of a potential trade war following Donald Trump's election win.

**Going Into Earnings, Is Albemarle Stock a Buy, a Sell, or Fairly Valued?**
Albemarle's stock is considered undervalued by Morningstar, with a 5-star rating and a long-term fair value estimate of $225 per share. The company's lithium business is expected to remain its largest, with prices expected to rise in 2025 after falling to cyclically low levels in 2024. Albemarle has a cost advantage in lithium carbonate production due to its brine assets in Chile and in bromine production due to its assets in the Dead Sea and Arkansas. The company is in good financial health, with a net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.1 times, but faces risks including volatile lithium prices, execution risk in ramping up lithium production, and political risk in Chile. 'We award Albemarle a narrow moat based on its strong and durable cost advantage in lithium and bromine production,' Morningstar said. 'We expect lithium prices will rise in 2025.'

**TRADE REVIEW: Asian lithium demand to slow in Q4 on seasonal lull; prices to be rangebound**
Asian lithium demand is expected to slow down in Q4 due to a seasonal lull and ample supply, with prices likely to be rangebound at Yuan 70,000-80,000/mt ($9,897-$11,310/mt). Chinese lithium carbonate prices ranged between Yuan 70,500/mt and Yuan 90,000/mt throughout Q3, with consumers adopting a wait-and-see approach due to fluctuating lithium futures contract prices. Term contract negotiations for the new year are expected to take place in Q4, but the demand outlook for 2025 remains unclear. According to Alice Yu, lead analyst at Commodity Insights, 'The outlook for China's PEV industry remains uncertain, with lithium demand and PEV sales unlikely to sustain growth momentum in the near term, given consumer affordability challenges and a slowdown in rolling out more affordable vehicle models.'

**Lithium Market Update: Q3 2024 in Review**
Lithium carbonate prices declined in Q3 2024, starting at $12,999 per metric ton and shedding 22% by September 10, hitting a three-year low of $10,019. Despite this, market watchers view Q3 as a price stabilization period, with prices trending upwards in the first weeks of Q4. Lithium producers scaled back output and expenditures due to slower demand growth, particularly from the EV sector. Chemical prices remained stable, while spodumene prices fell due to delayed response to chemical price declines. EV sales climbed in September, with global sales topping 1.7 million units, a new monthly record. The US and Canada saw steady growth, while Europe's numbers shrunk. Tariffs on Chinese EVs and lithium-ion batteries are set to increase, but domestic automakers are more interested in EV import tariffs. The US Department of Energy has offered funding support to domestic auto sector and lithium projects. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence forecasts a supply shortage starting as early as 2025, with several significant investments in future supply made during Q3.

**Argentina's Lithium Exports Double, but Revenue Decreases**
Argentina's lithium exports have doubled, but the revenue from these exports has decreased. According to the Bolsa de Comercio de Rosario (BCR), the prices of lithium carbonate have recovered 'scarcely' to below $10,000 per ton. The BCR report stated, 'The current situation in the lithium industry brings its challenges.' Despite the decline in prices, the local lithium chain continues to grow in production. In 2023, the chain's exports grew by almost 30% year-over-year, and in the first eight months of 2024, the export volume increased by over 53% compared to the same period last year. However, when measured in dollars, the exports decreased by 35% compared to the same period in 2023. The total exports of lithium carbonate from January to August 2024 amount to around $358 million, which is far from the $550 million of the previous year. The BCR calculated that the volume exported in the first eight months of 2024, valued at the average export prices of 2023, would have represented $763 million. China has become the main destination for Argentine lithium, with its participation increasing from 43% in 2023 to 69% in the first eight months of 2024. The BCR anticipates that the dynamic automotive industry in China will lead to a greater exchange and investments between Argentina and China in the future.

**Exporting Lithium Generates Fewer Dollars**
The current state of the lithium industry presents its challenges. As we highlighted a few months ago, the series of factors that led to lithium carbonate prices reaching over $80,000 per ton in 2022, began a downward trend in 2023, with international prices falling by 82% by early 2024. Today, prices have only slightly recovered, with values below $10,000 per ton. 'The situation of the lithium industry brings its challenges,' they added.

**[SMM Analysis] Analysis of LiPF6 Price Changes in September**
In September 2024, the price of lithium carbonate, a key raw material in the battery industry, began to rebound after a decline. The price of battery-grade lithium carbonate increased by 1.3% from 74,650 yuan/mt to 75,650 yuan/mt, while industrial-grade lithium carbonate rose by 1.5% from 70,450 yuan/mt to 71,500 yuan/mt. As a result, the price of LiPF6, an important electrolyte material for lithium batteries, also increased by 1.7% from 53,950 yuan/mt to 54,875 yuan/mt. Although there was a slight increase in market prices in September, the overall market remained relatively stable, reflecting the market's uncertainty about future demand and the cautious attitude of producers in price adjustments. The Shanghai Metals Market notes that future price trends should be closely monitored in light of the global economic situation and changes in industry supply and demand to better grasp market dynamics.

**High Voltage: Lithium sentiment is up but prices are still under pressure**
Lithium sentiment has increased due to supply cuts by CATL, but prices remain under pressure. According to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, prices for lithium chemicals have fallen 23.3% from the start of the year and 80% in 2023. Despite this, UBS predicts 11-23% upside on lithium carbonate for the rest of 2024. Analysts at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said, 'In the week to 25 September, lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate prices in China remained mostly flat as supply was sufficient to meet demand growth.' However, Shanghai Metals Market analyst William Gu expressed doubts that the announcement of a stimulus package by the Chinese government would support lithium prices in the longer term. Benchmark's weekly cobalt assessment was also rough, with cobalt sulphate prices down 0.9% WoW and 14.7% YTD, reaching a historic low since 2017. Panoramic Resources, the owner of the failed Savannah nickel mine, has been taken over by major investor Zeta Resources, but investors will receive nothing in the deal.

**Lithium Price Drop: A Sign of Market Saturation?**
The lithium market, crucial for the production of electric vehicle batteries, is experiencing a significant decrease in prices due to an excess of supply and lower-than-expected demand. According to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, the price of lithium carbonate in Asia fell to $12,500 per metric ton in mid-July 2024, the lowest level since the company began publishing weekly prices in early 2023. The decrease represents a 3.8% drop compared to the previous week and a drastic reduction from the $43,000 per ton recorded a year ago. The increase in lithium production, driven by the transition to clean energy, has disrupted the balance between supply and demand in this expanding sector. The overproduction has resulted in a surplus of inventories, particularly in China, which leads both in lithium refining and battery cell production. Analysts at Citi predict a 14.0% increase in global lithium demand this year, but the supply will rise by 18.0%, exacerbating the mismatch. Tony Ottaviano, CEO of Liontown Resources, described the market conditions as 'very, very tough'. However, the company has secured supply contracts with Tesla, Ford, and LG Energy Solution, which could provide some stability in the midst of market volatility. The excess supply is intensified by seasonal factors. In Qinghai Province, China, producers extracting lithium from salt lakes are increasing production due to better evaporation rates during the hot months. This seasonal increase in production puts even more pressure on prices, which are already at historically low levels. At a global level, lithium prices have fallen to their lowest levels in three years, following a two-year period of growth that drove prices to record highs and motivated new investments in mining. Despite its adverse effect on producers, some analysts consider the price drop as an opportunity to rebalance the market. Experts at Citi predict that lithium futures could decline by an additional 15% to 20% before starting to recover, possibly from next year if confidence in electric vehicles increases. Additionally, the Biden administration has set an ambitious goal to achieve commercial fusion energy in a decade, which could affect future demand for lithium and other battery materials.
