To forecast whether the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the NICS will exceed 2.4 million for November 2024, let's break down the problem:

**Reference Classes and Historical Data**:
1. **Base Rates**: Historically, NICS checks have shown significant fluctuation month to month, typically influenced by political events, legislation changes, societal unrest, or notable incidents.
2. **Recent Trends**: There were 1,302,857 background checks in October 2024, which is a 5% decrease from the previous year. This provides a baseline that reflects declining year-over-year numbers just the month before, though October had an increase of 200,000 checks from September 2024.

**Factors Specific to November 2024**:
- **Washington State Complication**: An outage in Washington State delayed processing background checks, leading to a backlog. This disruption is significant as Washington is a populous state with considerable demand for firearms.
- **Accelerating Processing**: The Washington situation is being remedied with efforts to catch up on batches of outstanding checks. However, this may not be enough to entirely compensate for the lost time, which is crucial for the monthly total.
- **Broader Economic and Political Climate**: There is a trend of heightened firearm purchases historically linked to political discussions about gun control. Although there are efforts from the Biden administration announcing enhanced background checks which might have suppressed some potential purchases, demand remains relatively elevated compared to historical averages.
   
**Resolving Forces**:
- **Negative Force**: The Washington State backlog and related delays pose a significant barrier to achieving over 2.4 million checks.
- **Positive Force**: Ongoing political pressures and discussions around potential new gun control measures could spur purchases, particularly in the lead-up to potential legislative changes.
   
**Balancing Inside and Outside Views**:
Given these factors, the obstacle presented by the Washington State backlog leans heavily towards under 2.4 million, yet broader national dynamics keep in place some pressure towards elevated numbers. However, the recent downward trending numbers, combined with the specific challenges like the Washington delay, provide a tempered expectation.

**Linear Extrapolation and Degrees of Doubt**:
Extrapolating from October's numbers would keep estimates conservative, particularly factoring the impact of the Washington disruption and factoring in a typical late-year seasonal spike. However, these are tempered by strong existing checks and balances in the system, potentially impacting December and later months more.

**Probabilistic Forecast**:
Given the combined weights of historical and specific factors for November 2024, including adjustments for the Washington delays, the incentives for purchasing before potential regulatory changes, and Octoberâ€™s downtrend, there remains skepticism about surpassing 2.4 million:
- **My Prediction**: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

2024-11-20 13:14:52,978 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30276:
Let me break this down systematically:

1. Historical Pattern Analysis:
- NICS checks typically show seasonal patterns with increases in November/December
- The articles mention 1.3M checks in October 2024, up 200K from September 2024
- Data shows 63 straight months of over 1M background checks

2. Recent Trends:
- There's a slight downward trend in 2024 compared to 2023 (October 2024 was 5% down from October 2023)
- However, October 2024 was still the fifth-best October on record
- Year-over-year monthly numbers have begun trending upward since July 2024

3. Current Contextual Factors:
- Upcoming 2024 election causing increased firearms interest
- Recent Washington state background check system outage creating backlog
- Biden administration's enhanced background check measures
- Declining violent crime rates potentially reducing urgency for purchases

4. Key Considerations:
+ Positive factors for exceeding 2.4M:
- Historical seasonal increase in November
- Election-related surge potential
- Backlog from Washington state system outage
- Growing trend since July 2024

- Negative factors:
- Overall declining trend from 2023
- Enhanced background check restrictions
- Lower crime rates reducing urgency
- Economic factors affecting discretionary spending

5. Analysis:
The combination of seasonal patterns, election-year dynamics, and the Washington state backlog suggest November 2024 will see significant volume. However, the broader declining trend and enhanced restrictions create some downward pressure. The 2.4M threshold appears achievable given historical patterns and current circumstances.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 75.80%, with 70.50% being the most likely. Probability: 70.50%.

To forecast the likelihood of November 2024 FBI firearms background checks initiated through the NICS exceeding 2.4 million, I'll methodically use a series of logical and statistical evaluation steps:

1. **Historical Base Rate Analysis**: 
   Analyze past trends to understand how often NICS checks exceeded 2.4 million in past November months. November usually sees a spike due to Black Friday sales and holiday shopping, though specific data is needed for precise estimations.

2. **Current Trends and Context**: 
   Background checks have seen decreased trends post the 2020 surge but are starting to rise since mid-2024. This suggests a potential increase in comparison to recent months.

3. **External Factors**:
   - **Legislation**: Recent gun control measures may reduce overall sales, as seen by the data pointing to fewer sales due to enhanced background checks.
   - **Market Demand**: Gun suppressor demand is at an all-time high, suggesting some segments in the firearms market are thriving.
   - **Political Climate**: Potential gun law changes hinted by Democratic leadership may spur a temporary rise in gun purchases due to fear of future regulations, adding complexity.

4. **Clashing Causal Forces**:
   The rise in suppressor sales may not directly reflect increased background checks, but the political push for legislation might increase sales soon after due to fear of restrictions. Additionally, the Washington state shutdown is a regional factor but could underscore technical vulnerabilities leading to instability in data reporting.

5. **Recent News Updates**:
   - The issues in Washington state's background check systems caused significant localized disruption, yet the quick clearing of backlogs suggests a temporary blip rather than a sustained impact. Still, a notable regional slowdown in firearms transactions during early November could dampen numbers slightly.

6. **Judgment on Evidence**:
   Weighing these factors, the historical precedent for large spikes during November due to consumer patterns like holiday buying is potent, but counterbalanced by potential impacts of regulations and the Washington disruption.

7. **Probabilistic Reasoning**:
   Balancing the aforementioned factors while considering historical volatility in firearms check numbers leads to a nuanced estimate. Calibration and resolution methods dictate assigning probabilities based on these multifaceted data points rather than oversimplifying the outcome to the occurrence of past events only.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

Let me break this down systematically:

1. Historical Context:
- NICS checks typically show seasonal patterns with increases in November/December
- Background checks have been trending down since 2020 peak but still above pre-2020 levels
- October 2024 had 1.3M checks, up from September but down 5% year-over-year

2. Recent Developments:
- Washington state system outage caused backlog of ~700 checks/day for 2 weeks
- Enhanced background check requirements for under-21 buyers
- Political context with upcoming election and gun control debates
- Overall trend shows declining gun violence/sales in 2024

3. Positive Factors for Exceeding 2.4M:
- Washington state backlog being processed
- Seasonal holiday buying pattern
- Political uncertainty driving purchases
- Historical November increases

4. Negative Factors:
- Overall downward trend in gun sales since 2020
- Enhanced background check requirements slowing processes
- October numbers show continued year-over-year decline
- Economic factors may limit discretionary purchases

5. Analysis:
- Starting from October's 1.3M, typical seasonal increase would need to be substantial
- Washington backlog adds perhaps 10,000 checks
- Historical patterns suggest November increase but likely not enough to reach 2.4M
- Recent trends and enhanced requirements suggest continued moderation

6. Balancing Evidence:
- While seasonal factors will drive increases, the magnitude needed (nearly double October) seems unlikely
- Recent trends and regulatory environment suggest continued moderation
- Political factors may drive some increase but unlikely enough to reach threshold

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To forecast whether the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the NICS will exceed 2.4 million for November 2024, let's analyze the situation:

1. **Historical base rates**: Historically, NICS background checks have shown a trend of surging in specific situations, such as election years or when there is heightened public discourse on gun regulations. The surge in 2020 was particularly notable, with numbers recently trending downward after the pandemic. However, starting in July 2024, year-over-year monthly numbers have begun trending upward again. It is also notable that the number of checks typically rises towards the end of the year.

2. **Recent trends and comparison**: The latest available data from October 2024 suggests there were 1,302,857 background checks. While this number is lower than the same month in 2023, it is a considerable increase over the preceding month, indicating a resurgence of interest in firearm purchasing.

3. **Factors influencing November 2024 checks**: Despite the recent upward trend, the news articles report several challenges that could impact the number. Washington state's background check system faced a significant outage in November 2024, causing backlogs and slowing down processes, though it is now back online. This disruption could affect the total counts for November 2024, depending on how quickly the backlog is resolved. Additionally, ongoing political developments around gun control measures may influence consumer behavior, potentially increasing demand.

4. **External influences and causal forces**: On one hand, Democrats' commitment to pursuing gun control measures could stimulate increased purchases as people may look to buy firearms ahead of potential regulations. On the other hand, the enhanced background checks and improved legislation enacted under the Biden Administration may slightly dampen the increase in checks by disqualifying certain purchases.

5. **Resolution probability assessment**: Given the historical pattern of increased checks towards the year-end and the political climate, coupled with the recovery from Washington state's backlog, it seems probable that the numbers may exceed 2.4 million, though the uncertainty remains due to recent disruptions and the slightly lower checks seen in October 2024 compared to the previous year.

To balance these considerations, weighing historical surges with recent events, a cautious yet optimistic probability seems appropriate:

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

2. **Recent trends and comparison**: The latest available data from October 2024 suggests there were 1,302,857 background checks. While this number is lower than the same month in 2023, it is a considerable increase over the preceding month, indicating a resurgence of interest in firearm purchasing.

3. **Factors influencing November 2024 checks**: Despite the recent upward trend, the news articles report several challenges that could impact the number. Washington state's background check system faced a significant outage in November 2024, causing backlogs and slowing down processes, though it is now back online. This disruption could affect the total counts for November 2024, depending on how quickly the backlog is resolved. Additionally, ongoing political developments around gun control measures may influence consumer behavior, potentially increasing demand.

4. **External influences and causal forces**: On one hand, Democrats' commitment to pursuing gun control measures could stimulate increased purchases as people may look to buy firearms ahead of potential regulations. On the other hand, the enhanced background checks and improved legislation enacted under the Biden Administration may slightly dampen the increase in checks by disqualifying certain purchases.

5. **Resolution probability assessment**: Given the historical pattern of increased checks towards the year-end and the political climate, coupled with the recovery from Washington state's backlog, it seems probable that the numbers may exceed 2.4 million, though the uncertainty remains due to recent disruptions and the slightly lower checks seen in October 2024 compared to the previous year.

To balance these considerations, weighing historical surges with recent events, a cautious yet optimistic probability seems appropriate:

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To forecast whether the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the NICS will exceed 2.4 million for November 2024, let's analyze the situation:

1. **Historical base rates**: Historically, NICS background checks have shown a trend of surging in specific situations, such as election years or when there is heightened public discourse on gun regulations. The surge in 2020 was particularly notable, with numbers recently trending downward after the pandemic. However, starting in July 2024, year-over-year monthly numbers have begun trending upward again. It is also notable that the number of checks typically rises towards the end of the year.

Let me break this down systematically:

1. Historical Context:
- NICS checks have shown consistent seasonal patterns, with November typically higher than October due to Black Friday sales
- October 2024 had 1.3M checks, up 200K from September 2024
- The trend since 2020's peak has been generally downward, but with recent upticks

2. Current Factors Supporting Higher Numbers:
- Approaching presidential election (similar to 2016 pattern mentioned)
- Recent discussion of Democrat gun control measures
- Seasonal increase expected for Black Friday sales
- Recent trend showing monthly increases since July 2024

3. Current Factors Supporting Lower Numbers:
- Overall downward trend since 2020 peak
- October 2024 showed 5% decrease from October 2023
- Recent Washington state background check system issues might affect national numbers

4. Specific Evidence:
- Last reported monthly number (October 2024): 1.3M
- Historical trend shows November typically significantly higher than October
- Presidential election dynamics similar to 2016 mentioned
- Recent increase of 200K from September to October 2024

5. Analysis:
- Starting from October's 1.3M base
- Historical November increase + Black Friday effect typically adds 40-50%
- Election year effect could further boost numbers
- Recent month-over-month growth trajectory
- System issues in Washington state might slightly dampen numbers

6. Calculation:
- 1.3M base + typical November increase (~50%) = ~1.95M
- Additional election year boost and current growth trajectory
- Accounting for some dampening effects from system issues
- Historical patterns suggest exceeding 2.4M is unlikely but possible

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 35.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To forecast whether the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the NICS will exceed 2.4 million for November 2024, I'll break down the situation using historical trends, recent events, and statistical analyses.

**Reference Class and Base Rate Analysis:**
1. **Historical Trends:** Historically, since the 21st century, the trend in firearms sales in the U.S. has risen significantly, peaking around 2020. Recently, since July 2024, there has been an upward trend in year-over-year monthly numbers. This suggests an underlying demand trend that could influence the November 2024 numbers.

2. **Base Rates:** Typically, the base rate of surpassing 2.4 million checks per month would be relevant; however, monthly numbers fluctuated widely due to various socio-political factors influencing gun sales (e.g., elections, civil unrest, legislation changes). Reviewing pre-2020 data, such levels weren't frequently surpassed, but the post-2020 period adjusted these expectations upwards.

**Inside View & Recent Developments:**
1. **Washington State Incident:** Recent cyberattacks and system outages in states like Washington have delayed background checks. Although the backlog has been worked through quickly once systems were restored, there were impacts during a critical buying period.

2. **Political Climate & Legislation:** There is an ongoing emphasis from the government on gun control measures, which historically tend to increase firearms purchases, as individuals anticipate future restrictions. 

3. **Current Month Data:** October 2024 saw 1,302,857 checks, which is a decrease compared to the previous month but reflects a rise from September 2024, suggesting an upward trend as the year-end approaches.

4. **Market and Economic Context:** Despite specific market disruptions (e.g., global supply chain issues, firearm industry struggles), there's underlying robustness in demand.

5. **External Forecasts or Reference Points:** In the absence of explicit forecasts from FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus relative to this precise metric, I'll rely on data trends and historical sequelae relevant to similar years.

**Forecast:**
Based on the current trajectory and external factors, including the resolution of systemic operational issues like the Washington state backlog, the underlying rising trend, and pre-election dynamics, it's reasonable to anticipate demand to be strong. However, risks persist in extrapolation due to potential further market disruptions or socioeconomic shifts.

**Balancing Over- and Under-reaction:**
While recent news articles suggest disruptions, the recovery appears fast, indicating a high probability of normalcy in operational checks affecting non-trivial firearm purchases this month. 

**Conclusion:**
After thorough analysis, I estimate the likelihood that checks will exceed 2.4 million for November 2024 as follows:

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

3. **Current Month Data:** October 2024 saw 1,302,857 checks, which is a decrease compared to the previous month but reflects a rise from September 2024, suggesting an upward trend as the year-end approaches.

4. **Market and Economic Context:** Despite specific market disruptions (e.g., global supply chain issues, firearm industry struggles), there's underlying robustness in demand.

5. **External Forecasts or Reference Points:** In the absence of explicit forecasts from FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus relative to this precise metric, I'll rely on data trends and historical sequelae relevant to similar years.

**Forecast:**
Based on the current trajectory and external factors, including the resolution of systemic operational issues like the Washington state backlog, the underlying rising trend, and pre-election dynamics, it's reasonable to anticipate demand to be strong. However, risks persist in extrapolation due to potential further market disruptions or socioeconomic shifts.

**Balancing Over- and Under-reaction:**
While recent news articles suggest disruptions, the recovery appears fast, indicating a high probability of normalcy in operational checks affecting non-trivial firearm purchases this month. 

**Conclusion:**
After thorough analysis, I estimate the likelihood that checks will exceed 2.4 million for November 2024 as follows:

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To forecast whether the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the NICS will exceed 2.4 million for November 2024, I'll break down the situation using historical trends, recent events, and statistical analyses.

**Reference Class and Base Rate Analysis:**
1. **Historical Trends:** Historically, since the 21st century, the trend in firearms sales in the U.S. has risen significantly, peaking around 2020. Recently, since July 2024, there has been an upward trend in year-over-year monthly numbers. This suggests an underlying demand trend that could influence the November 2024 numbers.

2. **Base Rates:** Typically, the base rate of surpassing 2.4 million checks per month would be relevant; however, monthly numbers fluctuated widely due to various socio-political factors influencing gun sales (e.g., elections, civil unrest, legislation changes). Reviewing pre-2020 data, such levels weren't frequently surpassed, but the post-2020 period adjusted these expectations upwards.

Let me break this down systematically:

1. Historical Context:
- 57+ consecutive months of over 1M NICS checks (as of late 2024)
- October 2024 had 1.3M checks (5% decrease from Oct 2023)
- Yet October 2024 was still the fifth-best October on record

2. Seasonal Patterns:
- November typically sees higher numbers than October due to:
  * Black Friday sales
  * Holiday shopping season
  * Hunting season
  * Historical pattern of increased sales

3. Current Factors Supporting Higher Numbers:
- Political tension ahead of 2024 election transition
- Democrats' stated intentions on gun control
- Recent system outages in Washington state creating backlog
- Seasonal shopping patterns

4. Factors Supporting Lower Numbers:
- Overall downward trend since 2020 peak
- Some economic constraints on consumer spending
- Recent decline in October numbers year-over-year

5. Specific Evidence:
- Recent news shows increased federal focus on background checks
- Surge in suppressor demand indicates continued strong firearms market
- Washington state backlog (~700 checks/day) will add to November numbers
- Political climate similar to 2016, which saw high numbers

6. Analysis:
- November 2023 was approximately 2.5M checks
- Given the 5% YoY decline seen in October, but factoring in:
  * Seasonal uplift
  * Political factors
  * Backlog effects
- A reasonable estimate would be slightly above 2.4M

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 75.50%, with 70.25% being the most likely. Probability: 70.25%

To conduct a forecast on whether the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the NICS will exceed 2.4 million for November 2024, we need to consider several factors from historical data and current trends.

### Base Rates and Historical Trends
1. **Past Data on NICS Checks**: Historically, gun sales and hence background checks have shown clear patterns often driven by political events, economic factors, and social issues. Post-2020, there appears to have been a structural increase in the number of background checks due to increased social unrest and changes in political climates affecting gun regulation discussions.

2. **Recent Trends**: The data mentions that starting from July 2024, there's been an upward trend in year-over-year checks. This suggests a potential increase in demand that could contribute towards exceeding 2.4 million checks.

### Distinctive Current Situations
1. **Washington State System Outage**: There has been a two-week delay in processing background checks in Washington, which was handling approximately 700 checks per business day prior to the outage. Given that the system was restored in mid-November, there will be a surge in numbers, but this may not be enough to significantly impact the national total.

2. **Political Climate and Gun Legislation**: Statements from political leaders regarding stricter gun regulations (such as banning certain types of firearms) typically lead to increased gun purchases as people react pre-emptively to potential restrictions.

3. **Seasonal Effects**: November typically sees a rise in firearm purchases due to holiday gift-buying and hunting season, which could push NICS checks higher.

### Comparison Classes
- The check numbers in October 2024 were reportedly the fifth-best for that month historically. November usually sees higher numbers due to the mentioned factors.

### Adjustments
- Despite potential surges from backlogged Washington State checks, this is likely balanced by the overall national trends such as increased demand due to policy threats, seasonal effects, and recent trend spikes.

### Conclusion
By analyzing the balance between political, social, and economic factors, while considering historical and seasonal trends, it's reasonable to predict that the number of background checks could indeed exceed 2.4 million for November 2024, but itâ€™s not a certainty. 

**My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 75.00%, but 67.50% being the most likely. Probability: 67.50%.**

- Despite potential surges from backlogged Washington State checks, this is likely balanced by the overall national trends such as increased demand due to policy threats, seasonal effects, and recent trend spikes.

### Conclusion
By analyzing the balance between political, social, and economic factors, while considering historical and seasonal trends, it's reasonable to predict that the number of background checks could indeed exceed 2.4 million for November 2024, but itâ€™s not a certainty. 

**My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 75.00%, but 67.50% being the most likely. Probability: 67.50%.**
2024-11-20 13:15:51,310 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30276:
To conduct a forecast on whether the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the NICS will exceed 2.4 million for November 2024, we need to consider several factors from historical data and current trends.

### Base Rates and Historical Trends
1. **Past Data on NICS Checks**: Historically, gun sales and hence background checks have shown clear patterns often driven by political events, economic factors, and social issues. Post-2020, there appears to have been a structural increase in the number of background checks due to increased social unrest and changes in political climates affecting gun regulation discussions.

2. **Recent Trends**: The data mentions that starting from July 2024, there's been an upward trend in year-over-year checks. This suggests a potential increase in demand that could contribute towards exceeding 2.4 million checks.

### Distinctive Current Situations
1. **Washington State System Outage**: There has been a two-week delay in processing background checks in Washington, which was handling approximately 700 checks per business day prior to the outage. Given that the system was restored in mid-November, there will be a surge in numbers, but this may not be enough to significantly impact the national total.

2. **Political Climate and Gun Legislation**: Statements from political leaders regarding stricter gun regulations (such as banning certain types of firearms) typically lead to increased gun purchases as people react pre-emptively to potential restrictions.

3. **Seasonal Effects**: November typically sees a rise in firearm purchases due to holiday gift-buying and hunting season, which could push NICS checks higher.

### Comparison Classes

2024-11-20 13:15:51,328 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30276:
Let me break this down systematically:

1. Historical Pattern Analysis:
- NICS checks typically show seasonal increases in November/December
- Last reported October 2024 had 1,302,857 checks, up 200,000 from September
- Current trend shows 63 straight months of over 1 million checks

2. Recent Contextual Factors:
- Washington state system outage in early November creating backlog of ~700 checks per day
- Enhanced background check requirements for under-21 buyers
- Political environment: heightened gun control discussion ahead of election

3. Key Evidence For Exceeding 2.4M:
- Seasonal holiday buying pattern
- Building political tension around gun control
- Backlog from Washington state system outage
- Historical November increases

4. Key Evidence Against Exceeding 2.4M:
- October 2024 numbers (1.3M) were 5% lower than 2023
- Overall downward trend since 2020 peak
- Recent reports of declining gun violence may reduce panic buying
- Economic factors might limit discretionary purchases

5. Recent Trends:
- Year-over-year monthly numbers trending upward since July 2024
- But absolute numbers still significantly below peak years

6. Analysis:
The combination of seasonal patterns, political tensions, and the Washington backlog suggest an increase from October's 1.3M, but reaching 2.4M would require nearly doubling October's numbers. While November typically sees increases, this magnitude of jump seems unlikely given current trends.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

- Recent reports of declining gun violence may reduce panic buying
- Economic factors might limit discretionary purchases

5. Recent Trends:
- Year-over-year monthly numbers trending upward since July 2024
- But absolute numbers still significantly below peak years

6. Analysis:
The combination of seasonal patterns, political tensions, and the Washington backlog suggest an increase from October's 1.3M, but reaching 2.4M would require nearly doubling October's numbers. While November typically sees increases, this magnitude of jump seems unlikely given current trends.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.
2024-11-20 13:15:51,328 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30276:
Let me break this down systematically:

1. Historical Pattern Analysis:
- NICS checks typically show seasonal increases in November/December
- Last reported October 2024 had 1,302,857 checks, up 200,000 from September
- Current trend shows 63 straight months of over 1 million checks

2. Recent Contextual Factors:
- Washington state system outage in early November creating backlog of ~700 checks per day
- Enhanced background check requirements for under-21 buyers
- Political environment: heightened gun control discussion ahead of election

3. Key Evidence For Exceeding 2.4M:
- Seasonal holiday buying pattern
- Building political tension around gun control
- Backlog from Washington state system outage
- Historical November increases

4. Key Evidence Against Exceeding 2.4M:
- October 2024 numbers (1.3M) were 5% lower than 2023
- Overall downward trend since 2020 peak
- Recent reports of declining gun violence may reduce panic buying
- Economic factors might limit discretionary purchases

5. Recent Trends:
- Year-over-year monthly numbers trending upward since July 2024
- But absolute numbers still significantly below peak years

6. Analysis:
