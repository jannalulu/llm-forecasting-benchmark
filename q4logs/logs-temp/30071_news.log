**Kalshi And Polymarket Shoot To The Top Of Apple's App Store Rankings Amid Election Euphoria - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)**

The growth was staggering, with Kalshi rising from 55th to 1st in the free app category and Polymarket jumping from 108th to 2nd in the same category. The surge in interest in predicting election outcomes drove the rankings, with both platforms allowing users to place bets on various election-related markets. Notably, a French 'Trump Whale' known as Theo netted almost $50 million on Polymarket following Trump's victory, while Harris' biggest backer, Redegen, lost around $6.7 million.

**Rising interest in election betting drives Kalshi, Polymarket to top Apple’s free app rankings**
Kalshi and Polymarket, two prediction markets, have topped the Apple App Store's free app downloads, pushing popular apps like ChatGPT and Google down the list. Kalshi, which operates under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), relaunched its 2024 presidential election betting market after a federal court victory. Polymarket, a decentralized peer-to-peer platform based on blockchain technology, has seen a jump in popularity despite operating without U.S.-based bets due to past regulatory challenges. According to Luana Lopes Lara, cofounder of Kalshi, 'prediction markets are the future.' Despite regulatory constraints, Polymarket's 2024 election contract recorded over $2.8 billion in wagers, while Kalshi's 2024 market generated a handle of under $300 million.

**The surge in election betting has catapulted Kalshi and Polymarket to the top of Apple's App Store**
Kalshi and Polymarket have reached the top of the Apple App Store due to a surge in election betting in the US presidential campaign. Kalshi, governed by the CFTC and legal for US citizens, held the number one spot, while Polymarket, available only to international bettors, had the number two spot. The two betting apps outranked popular smartphone apps like ChatGPT, TikTok, and Instagram. According to data from both websites, more than $4 billion worth of bets have been placed on Polymarket, compared to over $500 million for Kalshi. As of Tuesday afternoon, betting odds favor former President Donald Trump to win the Electoral College at 57% to 43% on Kalshi and 62% to 38% on Polymarket, and Vice President Kamala Harris to win the popular vote at 76% to 24% on Kalshi and 72% to 28% on Polymarket. However, the latest polling average from 538 has Harris leading 48% versus 46.8% for Trump. 'I think we're gunning for No. 1 for the entire App Store by Election Day, so the demand curve truly is exponential,' said Kalshi's CEO, Tarek Mansour, last month.

**Kalshi first, Polymarket fourth in financial category of Apple App Store on Election Day**
On Election Day, November 5, 2024, prediction platforms Kalshi and Polymarket reached top spots on the Apple App Store. Kalshi now ranks first in Apple's finance app category and third overall among free apps, while Polymarket is the fourth-highest ranking app in the finance app category. This represents both apps' highest placement to date, likely driven by interest in betting on election outcomes. Kalshi's market for the 2024 U.S. presidential winner, featuring former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, grew to $247 million, while Polymarket maintains $3.26 billion in total betting volume for the same market. Since launching in 2020, Polymarket has amassed $5.15 billion in cumulative trading volume. As a result of a federal court ruling, Kalshi was allowed to list election betting contracts in early October, after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sought to strictly regulate these 'event contracts.'

**Experts worry election-betting apps like Kalshi are skewed ahead of vote**
Experts are concerned that election-betting apps like Kalshi and Polymarket are skewed in favor of Donald Trump ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Despite the platforms' growing popularity, some economists worry that a handful of deep-pocketed investors can distort the odds, as seen in the case of a French national who spent over $45 million on bets that Trump will win. Polymarket has come under scrutiny for alleged flaws, including wash trading and a lack of transparency. In contrast, PredictIt, a platform that limits the number of users and position sizes, has shown more reliable odds, with Kamala Harris's chances exceeding Trump's for the first time in about a month. Experts debate whether prediction markets are better than models that use historical data to convert poll results into probabilities of the outcome, with some arguing that the biggest betting sites are too skewed in Trump's favor.
