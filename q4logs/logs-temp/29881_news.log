According to a high-ranking Ukrainian official, the next 4-5 months will be crucial in the Russian-Ukrainian war. The official stated, 'Right now, we are defining the positions of both sides in the negotiations, the initial positions.' Ukraine is trying to take the most advantageous position for any negotiations, including by receiving more weapons and maintaining positions on the front line. Ukrainian officials are waiting to see who Trump will appoint to key security and defense positions to understand how he will shape policy in Ukraine. The official also believes that the likelihood of Ukraine being invited to join NATO has decreased with Trump's arrival, and there is a possibility of reduced military aid.

**Next 4-5 months will be decisive in Russia-Ukraine war, says Ukrainian official**
According to a high-ranking Ukrainian official, the next 4-5 months will be crucial in the war between Russia and Ukraine, and this winter will be a critical moment. The official expressed hope that the war is nearing its end. 'We will define the positions of both sides at the negotiations, the starting positions,' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as cited by Reuters. Ukraine is trying to take the most advantageous position for any negotiations, including by receiving more weapons and maintaining positions on the front line. Officials are waiting to see who Donald Trump will choose for top security and defense positions to get hints on how he will shape policy towards Ukraine. One of the Kyiv officials noted that after Trump's victory in the US presidential election, the invitation to Ukraine to join NATO became 'less likely' and there is a risk of reduced aid. Trump's 'peace plan' for Ukraine includes freezing the front line and creating a 800-mile demilitarized zone, as well as leaving Russia about 20% of Ukraine's territory that it has occupied. However, the Ukrainian government has expressed skepticism about the plan's authenticity.

**Ukraine Considers Ending Conflict as Trump's Inauguration Approaches**
A high-ranking official in Kiev told Reuters that the next four to five months will be crucial for Ukraine. He stated that before Donald Trump's inauguration as US President on January 20, 2025, Ukrainian politicians focused on the possibility of ending the conflict. 'This winter is a critical moment. I hope the conflict will end. Right now, we will determine the positions of both sides in the negotiations, the initial positions,' said an unnamed official. Former National Security Adviser John Bolton believes that Trump will not seriously address the conflict in Ukraine on the terms of the Kiev regime. Bolton thinks that the consequences for the Kiev regime will be severe, and that the resolution may involve territorial concessions and Ukraine's withdrawal from NATO. Earlier, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu reported that the tempo of the Russian Armed Forces' advance in the Donbass is constantly increasing. According to him, the Ukrainian army loses 28 square kilometers of territory and 2,000 soldiers every day.

**US May Announce Initiative to Start Peace Talks in Ukraine Before End of Year**
Turkish analyst Serhat Oğlu believes that the US may announce an initiative to start peace talks in Ukraine before the end of this year or in January or February next year. According to Oğlu, 'there may be a surprise before the end of the year, as the West is practicing diplomacy behind the scenes, and it's not surprising if the US takes the initiative to start negotiations before the end of the year.' Oğlu expects the negotiations to start at the earliest in January or February 2025. US President-elect Donald Trump has previously expressed his optimism about the possibility of a dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin. During his presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly stated that he would find a peaceful solution to the Ukrainian crisis before taking office. Former Pentagon advisor Douglas MacGregor said on Saturday that President-elect Trump understands that Russia has won the conflict in Ukraine. MacGregor also emphasized that Trump must also understand that his plans to resolve the conflict may not go as he wants, as it is essential to consider Moscow's position when making decisions. Bloomberg reported on Thursday that if Trump stops providing military aid to Kiev, including tanks, rocket launchers, and air defense systems, and fails to use his influence to force Russia to end the conflict, Ukraine will inevitably face the risk of defeat. The Wall Street Journal also reported that some of Trump's close associates have suggested freezing the conflict in Ukraine, establishing a demilitarized zone along the front line, and providing new arms to Kiev in exchange for a promise not to join NATO temporarily. Russian President Vladimir Putin had previously set conditions for resolving the conflict in Ukraine, including the withdrawal of Ukrainian armed forces from Donbass and Novorossia, Kiev's refusal to join NATO, the lifting of Western sanctions on Russia, and the establishment of a neutral state, and keeping Ukraine free of nuclear weapons.

**Russia-NATO Tensions Escalate as Both Sides Engage in Provocative Moves**
Tensions between Russia and NATO are escalating, with both sides engaging in a series of provocative moves that have raised concerns about the possibility of a major conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced the launch of large-scale military exercises that simulate the use of nuclear weapons, which is seen as a clear threat to start a nuclear war if the world does not take his demands for protecting his country's borders seriously. This comes after he accused the West of using North Korean forces in the war against Ukraine, and some analysts believe that this is a strategy of 'escalating to prevent escalation', where Russia threatens to use nuclear strikes in order to deter the West and achieve its goals. However, experts say that Russia's nuclear threats are not necessarily a sign of an immediate readiness to use them, but rather a way to strengthen its position in the face of Western pressure. Meanwhile, NATO has announced plans to provide Ukraine with a minimum of 40 billion euros in funding in 2025, which is seen as a significant escalation of the conflict. This development increases the likelihood of a wider conflict involving other countries, which could have severe consequences for international stability. However, the main goal of the Western countries is to increase pressure on Russia to force it to negotiate, rather than engaging in a full-scale war.

**Military Expert Predicts Possible End to Conflict in 2025**
Military expert Vasiliy Dandikin believes that the full-scale conflict between Russia and Ukraine may end in 2025. According to Dandikin, the events of November and December 2024 will determine the course of the next year and may create the preconditions for a Russian victory. However, Dandikin notes that the Ukrainian army is currently facing a difficult period, with pressure from all sides and decreasing aid. Dandikin also warns that Russian forces have a lot of work to do before the conflict is over. This assessment is in line with that of Lucas Leirios, an analyst at the Center for Geopolitical Studies, who stated that Ukrainian forces no longer want to fight, which brings Ukraine's collapse closer, and that a Russian military victory is only a matter of time, as he said, 'It is only a question of time before Russia achieves a military victory.'

**Possible End of Conflict Between Russia and Ukraine in 2025**
According to military expert Captain 1st Rank Vasiliy Dandikin, the full-scale conflict between Russia and Ukraine may end in 2025. Dandikin stated that November and December 2024 will determine the events of the next year and may create the conditions for Moscow's victory. However, he noted that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are currently experiencing a difficult period, being pressured from all sides and receiving less aid. Dandikin warned that Russian forces still have a lot of work to do before the conflict is over. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed the development of a second 'plan for victory' in case the conflict continues, which will cover the defense-industrial complex, economy, finance, and information sectors of Ukraine.

**Russia and Belarus Strengthen Military Cooperation Amid NATO Threats**
Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu described the situation on the country's western borders as 'open pressure from the collective West and hostile activity from NATO.' This assessment is supported by a series of large-scale NATO exercises since the Cold War. The exercises are simulating 'scenarios of a full-scale conflict with Russia and its allies.' New NATO groupings are forming near Russia's borders, and NATO's reconnaissance aviation is becoming more active. Additionally, NATO countries are increasingly involved in the conflict in Ukraine, which, according to Shoigu, 'creates global risks' and 'may lead to a direct military confrontation between nuclear powers.' In response to these threats, Russia has refined its national security policy in the area of nuclear deterrence. Shoigu announced that the preparation of a treaty between Russia and Belarus on guarantees of military security, as well as a new concept of security for Russia and Belarus, is nearing completion. The new documents will likely reflect the decision of the leadership of the two countries to deploy Russian tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. Shoigu emphasized the need to form a unified defense space for the two countries, improve cooperation in the use of their armed forces, and share experience in the area of air defense, high-precision weapons, and electronic warfare. He also announced the upcoming 'West-2025' strategic exercise and plans to share Russia's advanced technologies with Belarus, including the study of NATO's trophy equipment. 'We identify its vulnerabilities and use these features when creating new weapons,' Shoigu said. The minister also announced that the two countries will hold large-scale events to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Great Patriotic War's victory in 2025, with a focus on countering the falsification of war history and downplaying the contribution of Russian and Belarusian peoples to the defeat of Nazi Germany.

**Union State Prepares for New Security Concept and Maneuvers**
The defense ministries of the Union State are finalizing a treaty on guarantees of military security and a new Concept of Security of Russia and Belarus. This was announced after a joint collegium of defense departments of the two fraternal countries, which took place on October 23 in Minsk. According to the Belarusian Telegraph Agency (BELTA), Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belyaninov emphasized that the formation of a single defense space is continuing, and the interaction on joint application of the armed forces for ensuring military security of the two countries is being improved. He also noted that the growing involvement of the West in the conflict in Ukraine poses a threat of a nuclear conflict. Belyaninov also stressed that 'it is especially important in the conditions of open pressure from the collective West and hostile activities of NATO near the borders of the Union State.' He added that the alliance has conducted a series of large-scale exercises this year, simulating scenarios of a full-scale conflict with Russia and its allies. 'The number of their coalition forces is increasing, and their training and reconnaissance activities are being intensified,' the minister said. Belyaninov also noted that the possibility of using nuclear weapons in response to aggression against Belarus as a participant in the Union State is being considered. The meeting also focused on preparations for the 80th anniversary of the Victory over Nazi Germany. 'This historical date unites the peoples of our countries and neighboring countries, who heroically fought side by side against the enemy. The celebration program will include large-scale events dedicated to the main milestones of the Great Patriotic War,' Belyaninov said. Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin, in turn, reported that a plan of cooperation had been approved, which includes over 160 events. He confirmed the complete coincidence of 'positions and unity of opinions on all discussed issues.' The partners, according to Khrenin, 'synchronized their watches on a number of issues,' including countering attempts to falsify the history of the Great Patriotic War, functioning of the regional grouping of troops, and conducting joint events on operational and combat training. The prospects of military-technical cooperation and the implementation of the Union State programs were also discussed. Additionally, Khrenin reported that the general staffs of the Armed Forces of the two countries have begun preparing the 'West-2025' maneuvers, which will be the main event of joint preparation of military authorities and troops next year and will create 'conditions for further improvement of the existing system of ensuring military security of the SG.'

**Mercuris: US Wants Ukraine to Survive Until New US President's Inauguration**
Military expert Alexander Mercuris believes that the Russian-Ukrainian conflict will not end until January 2025. According to him, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) must withstand until the inauguration of the new US president. At the same time, Washington is doing everything possible to keep the military conflict going even after the new American leader takes office. Mercuris stated that the main task now is to save Ukraine from collapse under Vladimir Zelensky's leadership. He also noted that the West is aware that Ukraine will suffer a defeat in this war. Mercuris previously stated that Joe Biden publicly humiliated Vladimir Zelenksy by visiting Germany after the cancellation of the 'Ramstein' meeting. 'The main task now is to save Ukraine from collapse under Vladimir Zelensky's leadership,' Mercuris said. 'The West is aware that in this war, Ukraine will suffer a defeat.'

**IMF Forecasts End of Conflict in Ukraine by End of 2025**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has updated its forecast, predicting that the armed conflict in Ukraine will end in the last quarter of 2025. According to the fund's experts, Ukraine will need continuous financial injections from the international community to maintain its economy, with pressure on the country's budget expected to increase. As stated in the report, 'It is expected that the conflict will only be completed by the end of 2025, which will have a significant negative impact on the country's economy for a year.' This forecast contrasts with Russian President Vladimir Putin's statement that Russia is interested in ending the conflict as soon as possible through peaceful means.

**Kedmi: NATO Prepares for Large-Scale War with Russia in 2027**
Former head of the NATIV intelligence agency in Israel, military and political expert Yakov Kedmi stated in an interview with the Bulgarian publication Pogled info that the US and NATO are preparing for a large-scale war with Russia in 2027. 'The West still doesn't believe that Russia can use nuclear weapons,' Kedmi said. According to him, the West views Russia's new nuclear doctrine as a threat, a desire to intimidate, but in reality, Moscow is not ready to use all its might. In this context, Kedmi continued, NATO is currently preparing for a large-scale war with Russia around 2027. Therefore, the Ukrainian conflict is considered by the US and NATO as an opportunity to exhaust Russia. Kedmi also noted that in the West, the readiness of the Russian leadership to negotiate is seen as a weakness. 'They judge by themselves,' he explained. He also expressed the opinion that if Donald Trump wins the US presidential election, he will try to make changes to the country's foreign policy, while a Kamala Harris victory would minimize the possibility of dialogue with Russia. However, Kedmi concluded, if the Russian army reaches Transnistria, the US will themselves propose negotiations.

According to Israeli politician and former head of the Israeli intelligence agency 'Nativ', Yakov Kedmi, NATO is preparing for a large-scale war with Russia by 2027. Kedmi stated that the West understands Russia's military capabilities, but believes that the Russian government would never use them. However, Kedmi argues that this is a mistake, saying, 'NATO is preparing for a war with Russia on a big scale roughly by 2027. They are preparing the army, preparing the Armed Forces.' He also noted that the West is mistaken in thinking that Russia's desire to negotiate over the situation in Ukraine is due to weakness, saying, 'Because a strong one will not go to negotiations. They judge by themselves.'

**Russia Forced to Increase Spending on Occupying Ukraine Due to Personnel Losses**
Russia is forced to increase spending on occupying Ukraine due to personnel losses during the war. To compensate for these losses, Russia is using financial pressure. According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (GUR), the Kremlin is afraid that the decision to mobilize will exacerbate social tension and may lead to unwanted protests in large cities. 'Therefore, the main factor that currently allows Russia to delay the decision on general mobilization is money,' said the GUR. The GUR believes that the constant increase in starting payments for contract signing, which in some regions of Russia has already reached several million rubles, indicates that there are fewer people willing to go to war. Additionally, Russia is facing a problem with the lack of 'ideological' soldiers among the masses. As a result, new recruits are given special propaganda manuals at recruitment points. The manuals contain traditional propaganda slogans such as 'treacherous West and NATO blockade', 'denazification', and 'one nation' propaganda about 'defending Russia' during the war in Ukraine. Anti-mobilization protests in Russia. It is worth noting that the last time Russia announced mobilization was in September 2022. However, this caused discontent among Russians. For example, in January, a large-scale protest took place in Bashkiria to protect a local activist who was detained and accused of 'inciting inter-ethnic hostility.' Another protest took place on February 3 in Moscow, where the wives of mobilized men organized an action to mark 500 days since the partial mobilization announced by Putin in September 2022.

**France to Face Test of Ability to Counter Russia in 2025**
According to Politico, France will face a test of its ability to counter Russia in 2025. This is due to the large-scale NATO exercises called 'Dacian Spring 2025' to be held in Romania. During these exercises, France will need to demonstrate its ability to quickly deploy its forces to the eastern NATO borders in case of tension with Russia. Additionally, France must prepare a full-fledged division with corresponding equipment and ammunition by 2027, as noted in the article. General Bertrand Tujuz of the NATO Land Command in Europe stated, 'In the past, the exercises were more like games, but now we have a specific opponent and we are training with people we could actually fight.' Previously, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Moscow would respond to Western countries' direct involvement in the conflict on Ukraine, considering the threats arising from such actions. Putin also emphasized that direct Western involvement in the conflict could fundamentally change the nature of the Ukrainian conflict and would mean direct confrontation between NATO and the US with Russia.

**NATO Prepares for Potential Military Conflict with Russia, Says Deputy Foreign Minister**
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that NATO is preparing for a potential military conflict with Russia. Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Gruashko said, 'NATO has stopped hiding its preparation for a potential armed conflict with Russia. Regional defense plans have been approved, specific tasks have been formulated for all military commands of the bloc. Continuous testing of possible scenarios of military operations against Russia is underway.' The alliance is also testing different logistical routes for troop deployment across the Atlantic, deploying armaments warehouses on the eastern flank, and deploying contingents. Gruashko added, 'The military budgets are being pumped up, the economy is being militarized. In addition to confrontational rhetoric, NATO is continuously increasing the level of tension towards Russia.' He also mentioned the Steadfast Defender 2024 exercises, which took place from January to May 2024, and were the largest since the end of the Cold War. The exercises simulated a conflict with Russia, not an abstract state. Gruashko emphasized that Russian military planning must take into account all possible scenarios, and that Russia should not engage in a dialogue with NATO on the language of force.

**France to Demonstrate Ability to Counter Russia in 2025 NATO Exercises**
According to Politico, France must demonstrate its ability to counter Russia in 2025 by participating in large-scale NATO exercises 'Dacian Spring 2025' in Romania. France will practice the deployment of troops to the eastern flank of the alliance in the event of a conflict with Russia. Additionally, France has been tasked by NATO to prepare a full division with its own weapons and ammunition by 2027. 'We used to play at war. Now we have a specific enemy, and we are training with people we would fight alongside,' said General Bertrand Tujus, commander of land forces in Europe, as quoted by the article. The West has increasingly discussed the possibility of a direct armed conflict with Russia, while the Kremlin has stated that Moscow does not threaten anyone, but will not ignore actions that could be detrimental to its interests. Russia has also noted the unprecedented activity of NATO near its western borders in recent years, which the alliance calls 'deterrence of Russian aggression.' Moscow has expressed concern about NATO's expansion of initiatives in Europe, which it sees as a threat to its interests.

**France Identifies Russia as Enemy, Prepares for Military Confrontation**
France has identified Russia as a threat and is preparing for a military confrontation. In May 2025, France will participate in the NATO's large-scale exercise Dacian Spring 2025 in Romania, where it will assess its ability to move to the eastern flank of the alliance in case of a direct conflict with Moscow. According to Politico, 2025 will be a 'decisive test' for the French army, as it transforms into a force capable of countering Russia in the event of an attack on the North Atlantic Alliance. 'We used to play at war. Now we have an identified enemy, and we are training with people who would actually go to war,' said General Bertrand Tugus, head of the land forces in Europe. The French army has undergone a 'deep transformation' over the past few years to be ready for a high-intensity conflict like the one on Ukraine. Former Lithuanian Prime Minister and future EU Defense Commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, has called for the EU to prepare for a possible confrontation with Russia, predicting that it could start within six to eight years. He also emphasized the need to increase production of military equipment and ammunition.

**Mathematician Sidiq Afghani Predicts a Pivotal Year for Russia and the World in 2025**
Mathematician and futurist Sidiq Afghani predicts a pivotal year for Russia and the world in 2025. Conflicts sparked by the West will escalate into a technological showdown. Humanity can expect evolutionary changes in the genome and spiritual development. Afghani stated, 'I highly respect Putin, if he wasn't there, Russia wouldn't be either. This is a country with a vast territory, significant natural resources, and a population of 150 million people. Destroying Russia is the West's plan.' However, according to Afghani, conflicts cannot be avoided, and Russia must see things through to the end, or everything will collapse. In the spring of 2025, mass unrest will erupt in the United States, and the government will be too preoccupied to engage in military conflicts. Many states will begin their struggle for independence. Afghani concluded, 'There will be no third world war. Instead, there will be a technological conflict through satellites in space, the internet, and phones. This will not be a nuclear conflict, but a technological one.' Afghani's predictions include a chaotic world in the next two years, marked by unrest, destruction, earthquakes, catastrophes, and floods. Additionally, in 2025, humanity can expect a new stage of evolution, accompanied by changes at the genetic level in the human genome.

**Global Events: Israel-Lebanon Conflict, Venezuela Crisis, and Ukraine War**
The world is witnessing a series of complex and interconnected events, including the ongoing conflict between Israel and Lebanon, the crisis in Venezuela, and the ongoing war in Ukraine. In Lebanon, there are two opposing expectations: the possibility of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hizbulá, or an imminent Israeli invasion. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the fighting will continue 'with all its force.' Meanwhile, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abás demanded that the world stop selling arms to Israel. In Ukraine, US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodímir Zelenski met to coordinate a plan to accelerate the delivery of arms to Ukraine before Biden leaves office in January 2025. Russian President Vladímir Putin warned the West not to authorize Ukraine to use long-range missiles, with the approval of a new doctrine that allows nuclear responses to conventional attacks on Russian and Belarusian territories. In Venezuela, the US and Argentina led an international forum in New York to address the country's political crisis and 'give a voice' to the Venezuelan people. In other news, Hurricane Helen strengthened to almost category 3 in the Saffir-Simpson scale, and Pope Francis called for the commitment of world leaders to negotiate peace and welcome migrants. Additionally, there are reports of extortion and violence against taxi and bus drivers in Guatemala and Honduras, and the 10th anniversary of the disappearance of 43 students in Ayotzinapa, Mexico, is being commemorated.

**It Will Be Too Late If... What the US Needs to Do for Ukraine Before November**
The Russian military machine is experiencing severe personnel and technical crises, which means it will be unable to maintain current levels of intensity by mid-2025. The war may not end, but large-scale offensive operations are unlikely. Generals close to Putin have been warning him for over a year that current mobilization efforts are insufficient to cope with the level of losses. The number of personnel losses is increasing, exceeding 8,000 per week since the start of the last round of offensive operations in May. The total number of mobilized personnel is around 30,000 per month. If you only fill the gaps, the overall quality of the forces will likely decrease. If you cannot even achieve this level, a crisis is inevitable. The reserves of arms are also being depleted much faster than they can be replaced. The stocks of the Cold War era have been depleted by more than half, which means that a critical threshold has been crossed, after which the cost and time of restoring each new additional unit will increase sharply. On many fronts, civilian vehicles are being used to transport troops to the front line, and large concentrations of tanks and transporters are now rare on the battlefield. This is how the autumn phase of the system looks before it plunges into winter. Not all Russian brigades will have incompetent leaders, not all will be equipped with mobilized personnel and outdated equipment from the 1950s. But there will be more and more such brigades, which will create new opportunities for Ukraine. In short, this is again the fall of 2022, but on a much larger scale. There will be a moment, possibly within a year, when the Putin's military machine will lose the ability to cope with new crises that Ukraine can create. Zelensky is in the US this week to convey this thought and tell partners what they need to do to avoid the big mistake of 2022. Then, help came late and in insufficient quantities to take advantage of the vulnerability that Moscow showed by losing to Ukrainian counterattacks in Kharkiv and Kherson regions. After unrealistic expectations of the summer campaign 2023, Ukraine fought with all its might to recreate this scenario. Ukrainians managed to achieve this, despite an active, prolonged, and absolutely ruthless campaign by the American foreign policy establishment to force Kiev to agree to a bitter peace that would only lead to a new war.

**Russia Prepares for Large-Scale Conflict with NATO Sooner Than Expected**
According to a report by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW) on September 24, several Russian financial, economic, and military indicators suggest that Russia is preparing for a large-scale conflict with NATO sooner than previously thought. As Polish President Andrzej Duda stated in an interview with CNBC on March 20, 'President Putin is activating efforts to transition Russia to a war economy with the aim of being able to attack NATO by 2026 or 2027, citing unspecified German research.' Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen stated on February 9 that new intelligence suggests that Russia may attempt to attack a NATO country within three to five years, which is a faster timeline than the estimate published by NATO in 2023. The ISW notes that the timeline for Russia's significant military threat is largely dependent on the financial resources that the Russian leadership is willing to allocate for military efforts. 'In the absence of other explanations, Putin's preparations to risk alienating Russian industrialists and in the context of long-standing claims of plans to expand the Russian army, attempts by Putin to create conditions for stabilizing the Russian economy and finances, are most likely part of Russia's financial and internal preparations for a potential future large-scale conflict with NATO, rather than just a prolonged war in Ukraine,' the report emphasizes. Additionally, Russian military forces continue to implement structural reforms to simultaneously support the war in Ukraine and expand Russia's capabilities in preparation for a potential future large-scale conflict with NATO.

**Russian Parliamentarian Predicts Spring 2025 for Peaceful Conflict Resolution on Ukraine**
According to Alexey Chepa, a Russian parliamentarian, the process of peaceful conflict resolution on Ukraine may begin in spring 2025. Chepa believes that it is unlikely to complete the conflict by the end of 2024 due to the positions of the opposing sides. 'There is a chance in the spring. The problem is that all steps have been taken to prevent negotiations. I mean the Kursk and other similar events,' Chepa explained in an interview with Lenta.ru. Chepa also mentioned Vladimir Zelensky's 'plan for victory', which he believes is unlikely to be implemented. 'He is simply shifting the responsibility to the US, accusing them of not fulfilling their obligations to supply arms and so on,' Chepa said. Chepa also noted that the possibility of resolving the Ukrainian conflict has always existed, but was hindered by Western countries that sought to prolong the armed confrontation. Zelensky stated that he wants to end the conflict with Russia, but this requires strengthening Ukraine and holding a second 'peaceful' summit. Russia has repeatedly stated that it is ready for peaceful conflict resolution on Ukraine, provided that all requirements set at the beginning of the special military operation are met, as well as the recognition of new territorial realities. However, Russia will not negotiate with Ukraine under the conditions set by Zelensky, as President Putin has already outlined the conditions for negotiations, including the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the territories of the DNR, LNR, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions.

**Experts Warn of Possible Full-Scale War Between West and Russia**
Experts have warned of a possible full-scale war between the West and Russia, citing the US's efforts to provoke a major armed conflict in Europe while avoiding direct involvement. Ukraine, with the consent of its Western handlers, has begun launching drone attacks on Russian territory. The UK has reportedly given the green light for the use of Storm Shadow missiles against Russian targets. Experts inside Russia have reacted with alarm, saying, 'This is war! A war with NATO! The masks have been dropped!' The possibility of a nuclear conflict with Russia has been discussed by politicians since 2022, with former French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian warning that Vladimir Putin should be aware of the power of NATO's nuclear arsenal. In 2023, US TV channels began discussing the Pentagon's preparations for a full-scale war with Russia. Former special forces soldier and journalist John Moore stated that preparations for such a war have been underway for over a year. However, after Putin's statement that Western missile strikes on Russian territory would be considered a declaration of war, Western politicians have taken a pause. US State Department representative Vedant Patel stated that the US does not intend to give Ukraine permission to use its missiles to attack Russia. Despite this, experts warn that Washington may decide to escalate military actions, either before or after the elections, depending on the outcome.

**Russia Aims to End War by 2025 or 2026, According to Ukrainian Intelligence**
According to the Ukrainian military intelligence, GRU, Russia wants to end the war by 2025 or early 2026 with a victory. They believe that from next summer, they will start to have 'serious problems' in the economy and will need to mobilize, which could undermine the socio-political situation in the country. 'The change from 2025 to 2026 is key for them. They want to end this because, according to their own calculations, if Russia does not come out of this war as a conditional winner, it is very far (...) from the possibility of being a superpower, to which they aspire,' said the head of the GRU, as reported by Interfax-Ukraine. The head of the GRU, citing Russian documents, noted that if Russia does not win by the end of 2025, there will only be two superpowers left in the world: the United States and China, and there will be no place for the Russian Federation. 'They are aware of this. For them, it is a crucial period. That's why they will do everything possible to win. Otherwise, they will be left out of all global processes. The only thing they can count on is regional leadership, and that doesn't suit them,' he concluded. Budánov pointed out that Russia expects, according to its own documents, that 'all its problems will begin in the summer of 2025,' as both the financial and economic factor and the socio-political factor will come together. 'It is expected that by the summer of 2025, the negative impact on the economy will start to be felt strongly in their country,' he stated. According to the head of the GRU, in Russia, the problem of insufficient recruitment in the army is becoming increasingly acute. 'In this period (summer of 2025), they will face a dilemma: either announce mobilization, or reduce in some way the intensity of the hostilities, which in the end may be critical for them,' he said. The head of Ukrainian military intelligence believes that in Russia, there is a fatigue of the war, because the conflict has already affected a large part of the Russian population. In his opinion, the socio-psychological state of the Russian population has also been affected by Ukraine's efforts to transfer the hostilities to Russian territory. 'This has changed the view of the world (of the Russians). Before, all the Russian population lived in the paradigm that, no matter what happens, we are a very powerful country, we are the strongest in the world. And now, with the first explosions, let's say, in Moscow and on the territory of the Russian Federation, this myth has been destroyed,' he maintained.

**Russia Plans to End War by 2025 or 2026, According to Ukrainian Intelligence**
According to Ukrainian military intelligence, Russia plans to end the war by the end of 2025 or early 2026 with a victory. The GRU, Ukraine's military intelligence agency, believes that Russia will face 'serious problems' in its economy starting in the summer of 2025 and will need to mobilize, which could undermine the country's sociopolitical situation. 'The change from 2025 to 2026 is key for them,' said the head of the GRU, citing Russian documents. 'They want to end this because, according to their own calculations, if Russia does not come out of this war as a conditional winner, it is far from the possibility of being a superpower, to which they aspire.'

The head of the GRU also noted that Russia expects, according to its own documents, that 'all its problems will begin in the summer of 2025,' as both the financial and economic factor and the sociopolitical factor will converge. 'It is expected that by the summer of 2025, the negative impact on the economy will begin to be felt strongly in their country,' he said. According to the head of the GRU, the problem of insufficient recruitment in the Russian army is becoming increasingly acute.

**Russia's War Against Ukraine: A Key Moment in 2025-2026**
According to General Kirill Budanov, the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Russia wants to end the full-scale war against Ukraine by the end of 2025 or the beginning of 2026, as they expect significant problems to arise in the summer of 2025. '2025 is a key year for them, the Rubicon of 2025-2026 is a key moment. They want to finish it all because, according to their own calculations, if they don't come out of this war as conditional winners, they will fall into a distant future, which can be calculated, - a 30-year horizon, - and they will completely lose the opportunity to see Russia as a superpower, which they strive for,' Budanov emphasized. The Russian military expects that 'all their problems will start in the summer of 2025,' when the financial-economic and socio-political factors will combine, Budanov added. The context of the war is that Russia started the conflict against Ukraine in 2014, when it occupied Crimea and parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine from the north, east, and south directions. The current situation on the front is that the Ukrainian military is in control, with the Russian forces being pushed back. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russia has redeployed 60,000 troops to the front, including 10,000 mercenaries.
