**Is the Era of Remote Work Coming to an End?**
Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, has announced that the company will end its hybrid work model, requiring administrative employees to return to the office full-time. Failure to comply may result in termination. This decision has been met with resistance from employees, with 73% of administrative staff reportedly seeking new jobs. The move has sparked debate about the future of remote work and its benefits. Nicholas Bloom, an economist from Stanford University, acknowledges that remote work can hinder learning, innovation, and communication, but also highlights its benefits for work-life balance and employee well-being. Other companies, such as Microsoft and Google, have stated that they will maintain a hybrid work model, but only if productivity remains high. The article suggests that companies should strive for a balance between employee satisfaction and productivity, rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all approach.

**Books: Rise, fall and rise of Masayoshi Son mirrors extraordinary era**
Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank Group, has a vastly different investment philosophy and personal style compared to Warren Buffett. However, as revealed in Lionel Barber's new biography, the two men met in 2017 when Son attempted to interest Buffett in SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund. The fund included companies with inflated valuations, such as WeWork, which was described by a SoftBank insider as 'feeding a monkey alcohol' due to its founder Adam Neumann's excessive spending and hype. Son's insistence on setting his sights higher led to the fund's downfall, mirroring the rise and fall of Son's own career. 'Masa' flew directly from Tokyo to Buffett's home in Nebraska to pitch the Vision Fund, showcasing his unique approach to business. According to Barber, Son's actions were a reflection of the extraordinary era in which he operates.

**Adam Neumann plots Flow's expansion in South Florida and Middle East**
Adam Neumann, former CEO of WeWork, is optimistic about the expansion of his latest venture, Flow, a community-focused residential property provider, in South Florida and the Middle East. Flow has already seen success in South Florida, with its two apartment buildings, Flow Miami and Flow Fort Lauderdale, almost entirely leased. Neumann plans to 'double down' on South Florida and Saudi Arabia, with potential locations in Jeddah and West Palm Beach. Flow's focus on community and technology allows it to charge a premium, with rents ranging from $2,223 to $5,000. Neumann believes that Flow's unique approach is not just about amenities, but about creating a 'feeling' of community. The company owns and manages its properties outright, unlike WeWork, and develops its technology in-house. Expansion plans include a new condominium property, Flow House, in Miami, and further expansion in the Middle East.

**Adam Neumann's New Venture: WorkFlow, a Competitor to WeWork**
Adam Neumann, the founder of WeWork, has launched a new company called Flow, which specializes in building, renting, and managing real estate. Flow has received $350 million in investments from Andreessen Horowitz and has a valuation of over $1 billion. Neumann has also created a new product called WorkFlow, which is a competitor to WeWork.

The company has already signed its first lease for an office space in Fort Lauderdale, and plans to expand to other locations. Neumann has learned from his past mistakes with WeWork, and is taking a more cautious approach with WorkFlow, saying 'we're not rushing, we're not trying to be the first, we're just trying to do it right'.

**Is Nike Laced Up and Ready to Go? | The Motley Fool**
Motley Fool analysts Jason Moser and Ricky Mulvey discuss various companies, including Nike, Tesla, and WeWork. Nike's recent earnings report showed a decline in revenue and a decrease in direct and digital sales. Jason Moser believes that Nike's strategy is the main issue, and that the company needs to focus on its wholesale relationships. Tesla's delivery numbers were slightly lower than expected, but the company's overall performance is still strong. Jason Moser notes that Tesla is a polarizing investment idea, and that CEO Elon Musk's behavior has increased the risk profile of the company. WeWork's founder Adam Neumann has introduced a new competitor to WeWork, called Flow, which is a more mature version of the company. Jason Moser is skeptical of Neumann's ability to succeed with this new venture. The conversation also touches on the importance of leadership and vision in companies that are trying to pivot or expand their business models.

**WeWork Expands in Mexico, Sees Growth in Nearshoring Trend**
WeWork, a multinational coworking space company founded in 2010 by Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey, has faced challenges in recent years. However, under the leadership of John Santora, the company has expanded to 629 locations worldwide. In Mexico, WeWork has 22 buildings, with 14 in Mexico City, 4 in Guadalajara, and 4 in Monterrey, totaling over 200,000 square meters and hosting 5,000 companies with nearly 30,000 employees. The company's first location in Mexico was in the Varsovia building in the Juárez neighborhood, and it has since expanded to other areas, including Reforma, Polanco, and Mitikah. WeWork's CEO in Mexico, Karen Scarpetta, notes that the company has seen a significant increase in occupancy, from 30% in 2020 to 75% in 2024. Scarpetta attributes this growth to the company's flexibility and the increasing trend of 'nearshoring,' where US companies are using Mexico as a hub for technological development. WeWork is expected to continue this trend, with estimates suggesting that the company's spaces could triple in the next few years. In 2025, WeWork plans to focus on consolidation and expansion in the Mexican market.

**Adam Neumann Launches New Company Workflow, Focused on Flexible Office Spaces**
Adam Neumann, the founder of WeWork, has launched a new company called Workflow, which offers flexible office spaces. Unlike WeWork, Workflow focuses on creating a calm and productive work environment, with luxurious furniture and artwork. Neumann's new company is part of Flow, a real estate company that he founded in 2022, which has received $350 million in funding from Andreessen Horowitz. Flow has four residential buildings in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Atlanta, and has also established a property management arm. Workflow will offer shared workspaces and private offices for rent, and has already signed its first deal with a tenant in Fort Lauderdale. Neumann has learned from his previous experience with WeWork, where he was ousted in 2019 after the company's IPO was delayed. He has vowed to take a more cautious approach with Workflow, saying 'we're not trying to be the biggest, we're trying to be the best.'

**WeWork's Adam Neumann Is Back -- and He's Launching a New Miami Condo Complex Called Flow House: See Inside the Luxury Units**
Adam Neumann, the founder of WeWork, is back in the real estate market with a new luxury condo complex in Miami called Flow House. The 40-story building, scheduled to open in 2025, will offer 466 upscale units for sale, each with expansive floor-to-ceiling windows, luxurious bathroom finishes, and custom lighting packages. Flow House aims to provide a sense of community and connection, with amenities such as a social lounge, yoga studio, and conference room. According to Neumann, 'We learned while building Flow over the last two years that the exact same needs faced by renters are also faced by owners in terms of lack of community and lack of connectivity.' The complex will also feature a lobby bar, 24-hour resident service, and access to food and beverage services. Neumann's company, Flow, earlier this year offered to buy WeWork for $650 million.

**Adam Neumann's New Venture Sounds a Lot Like WeWork**
Adam Neumann, the co-founder of WeWork, is starting a new service called Workflow, which offers coworking spaces with a more sophisticated aesthetic. According to Bloomberg, Workflow will operate within Neumann's real estate company, Flow, which focuses on luxury housing. Unlike WeWork, Workflow will rely on spaces within Flow's residential buildings, potentially reducing long-term lease expenses. Neumann stated, 'I am the kind of person who actually learns more from their mistakes than their successes,' and 'when people like being in a building, they stay.' Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm, has invested $350 million in Flow and expressed its support for Neumann, saying, 'For Adam, the successes and lessons are plenty and we are excited to go on this journey with him and his colleagues building the future of living.'

**Adam Neumann Is Launching a New Coworking Service That Isn't WeWork: 'I Had Time to Reflect'**
Adam Neumann, the co-founder of WeWork, is launching a new coworking service called Workflow, which is part of his broader real estate company, Flow. According to Neumann, 'I had time to reflect' on his past mistakes, including WeWork's failed IPO attempt and subsequent bankruptcy. Workflow differs from WeWork in its aesthetic and business model, relying on spaces within Flow's residential buildings to minimize long-term lease expenses. Neumann stated, 'when people like being in a building, they stay. When people stay, it increases occupancy and the value.' Flow received a $350 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz in 2022, which pushed its valuation above $1 billion. Neumann is also launching Flow House in Miami, a 466-unit condo complex with baseline prices starting at $450,000.

**WeWork co-founder launches sales for Miami Worldcenter condo (Photos)**
Flow, a real estate venture founded by Adam Neumann, former CEO of WeWork, has launched sales for its 40-story high-rise condo, Flow House Miami, in the Miami Worldcenter area. The 466 residences, ranging from 307 to 1,165 square feet, start at $450,000 for a studio and $600,000 for a one-bedroom. The project includes offices and flex work spaces by Workflow, a coworking venture by Neumann, as well as luxury amenities such as a yoga studio, spa, and resort-style pool. Construction on the site started in February 2022, after a $108 million loan was obtained, and is now under construction. Flow House Miami is located in the midst of Miami Worldcenter, a 27-acre mixed-use community.

**Adam Neumann's new startup is reworking WeWork's old business model**
Adam Neumann, the founder of WeWork, is launching a new coworking venture called Workflow, which will operate under his residential real estate company, Flow. Neumann has learned from WeWork's past struggles and is adopting a different business model, leasing out space in residential buildings that Flow already owns, and managing other spaces in partnership with landlords. This approach aims to avoid the vulnerabilities that contributed to WeWork's downfall. Neumann has stated that he is approaching his new venture with humility and a focus on community-building, saying, 'The lack of community and the disconnection that people feel is even more relevant today.' He has also emphasized the importance of listening and slowing down, lessons he learned from his past experiences. Workflow will rent office space to both Flow residents and outside companies, and Neumann has expressed confidence in the venture's potential for success.

**Adam Neumann Launches Workflow, a Coworking Service to Compete with WeWork**
Adam Neumann, co-founder of WeWork, is back in the coworking sector with a new project called Workflow. Four months after a failed attempt to re-buy his old company, Neumann launched Workflow, a coworking service that will directly compete with WeWork. According to Bloomberg, Workflow will focus on spaces in residential buildings that Neumann's real estate company, Flow, already owns or manages. This approach aims to avoid the long-term commitments associated with traditional leases. Neumann claims that Workflow is filling a gap in the market, driven by the growing demand for flexible workspaces post-pandemic. 'The lack of community and disconnection people feel is even more relevant today,' Neumann says, assuring that there is renewed demand for community-driven workspaces. Workflow is part of Flow, the real estate company Neumann founded in 2022, which has already received significant investments, including $350 million from venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz. Flow currently has four residential buildings in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Atlanta, and has expanded to international markets like Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The company is also starting to sell units in a condominium project in Miami. Flow's mission, according to Neumann, is to create connections between residents and provide easy access to amenities, which is extended to Workflow, offering integrated coworking spaces in its residential buildings. The goal is to blend living and working environments, with private offices and community coworking areas available to tenants and companies. Unlike WeWork, Neumann says he is approaching Workflow with more caution and discipline. 'I know my priorities because of what I've been through,' Neumann said, adding that his new approach is about 'slowing down' and listening more attentively. 'We're learning. We're not rushing.'

**Ghosts of the venture capital bubble haunt OpenAI's $229b moment**
The recent $229 billion funding round for OpenAI, led by Thrive Capital, has raised concerns about the speculative mania of the past. The company, which created ChatGPT, is not profitable and is expected to lose $5 billion this year. Despite this, investors such as SoftBank and Tiger Global Management have invested heavily in OpenAI, with SoftBank investing $500 million and Tiger Global Management investing $350 million. The deal has been compared to the failed investment in WeWork, which was led by SoftBank's Masayoshi Son. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, has portrayed the for-profit transition as a natural part of the organisation's evolution, but it has led to intense internal turmoil. The company's revenue is expected to climb to $11.6 billion in 2025, but it is still in the early stages of financial maturation. As Adam Neumann, the former CEO of WeWork, says, 'We're really not sure that we know the answer.'

Adam Neumann, co-founder of WeWork, is launching a competitor called Workflow, four months after a failed bid to buy back WeWork. Workflow aims to create a more adult version of WeWork, offering office space on flexible terms, but with a calm atmosphere and high-end design. Unlike WeWork, which signed long-term leases and relied on short-term leases for revenue, Workflow is building offices in residential buildings it owns or partnering with landlords to manage spaces. As Neumann said, 'Workflow is a more mature and sophisticated take on the coworking model.' Neumann's new venture is a direct challenge to WeWork, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June.

Flow plans to expand its US portfolio to six buildings by early 2025 and will oversee Canada Global's real estate activities outside of Israel.

**Adam Neumann's Flow Expands into Saudi Arabia, Raising Questions about Intentions and Impact**
Adam Neumann, the founder of WeWork, has launched a new startup called Flow, which offers co-living and apartment rentals in Saudi Arabia. Flow has opened its first properties in Riyadh, with a focus on creating a community-driven living experience. The startup has acquired over 1,000 apartments in the city and plans to expand to other locations. Flow's model includes amenities such as coworking spaces, yoga classes, and hotel-style cleaning services. Neumann has a history of controversy in Saudi Arabia, where he was a key supporter of the country's Vision Fund, but has also faced criticism for his ties to the country's human rights record. Flow's expansion into Saudi Arabia has raised questions about Neumann's intentions and the potential impact on the local market. 'Flow is designed for everyone,' said Amy Stevens, Flow's spokesperson, in a statement to Forbes. 'The changes in the building design are to align with our brand.' Neumann has also hinted at plans to expand Flow to other countries, including the US. 'Arabia Saudita is almost like a startup,' Neumann said in a conference last year. 'Arabia Saudita has a founder. Not a founder, a prince.' Flow is not Neumann's first attempt at the co-living market, having launched WeLive in 2016, which was later shut down due to financial struggles. 'WeLive was a failure,' Neumann said in a recent interview. 'But Flow is different. Flow is a community-driven living experience.'

**Adam Neumann's Flow Launches in Saudi Arabia with a Focus on Community-Driven Living**
Adam Neumann, the founder of WeWork, has launched his new business, Flow, in Saudi Arabia. Flow is a startup that aims to revolutionize the concept of rentals and co-living in large residential complexes. Neumann's startup has opened its first properties in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, with a focus on creating a community-driven living experience. The properties feature coworking spaces, yoga classes, and hotel-style cleaning services. Neumann's goal is to create a sense of community among residents, with services such as laundry and cleaning, as well as amenities like pools, gyms, and bowling alleys. Flow has also launched in Florida, with a focus on offering long-term rental contracts in eco-friendly buildings. The startup has received funding from Andreessen Horowitz and has plans to expand globally. Neumann's previous attempt at co-living, WeLive, was shut down after his departure from WeWork. Flow is seen as a new attempt by Neumann to enter the residential market, with a focus on community-driven living. 'Flow is designed for everyone. The changes in the building are to align it with our brand,' said Amy Stevens, Flow's spokesperson, in a statement to Forbes. 'We saw residential buildings and said, what if we use technology to operate the systems better, bring people who focus on hospitality... and run an apartment building like the Four Seasons, with that level of service?' Neumann said in an event in Saudi Arabia in October 2023. 'Arabia Saudita is almost like a startup,' Neumann said in a conference in March 2023, alongside his investors Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz. 'Arabia Saudita has a founder. You don't call him a founder, you call him his highness,' Horowitz said in reference to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Flow has also organized events such as a 'cacao ceremony' and yoga classes, with the goal of creating a sense of community among residents. 'Join a art class, perfect that yoga pose or discover the hidden corners of our beloved city with your new friends,' Flow Riad posted on Instagram in August. Neumann has a history of investing in real estate, with a focus on co-living and community-driven living. He has also invested in a property management startup, Alfred, and acquired a rival startup, Carson, whose technology is now integrated into Flow. 'We are not and were not rivals,' said Stevens. 'Arabia Saudita is a great place to start a new business,' Neumann said in a statement to Forbes. 'We are excited to bring Flow to the region and create a new standard for co-living and community-driven living.'
