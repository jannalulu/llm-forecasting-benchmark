The court's secretary general had previously announced that the analysis would be delayed until after November 27 due to the absence of some magistrates. However, with the return of magistrates and the completion of the full membership, the court can now proceed with the analysis.

Trump's cabinet picks are also generally approved of. In the 2028 elections, Republicans favor JD Vance as their candidate, while Democrats favor Kamala Harris. The poll also found that 39% of registered voters believe there will be another World War, while 26% do not think there will be another World War. Additionally, 37% of voters believe aliens have visited the Earth, a 12-point increase from 2022. Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said, 'Trump's favorability varies significantly by gender, race, and age.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2024 07:46 PM\nSource:[Redstate](https://redstate.com/wardclark/2024/11/26/emerson-poll-trump-jumps-2028-already-in-play-n2182501)\n\n**'Optimistic For The Future': CNN's Enten Breaks Down Americans' Historically High Approval Of Trump's Transition**\nCNN senior data reporter Harry Enten analyzed Americans' historically high optimism and approval for President-elect Donald Trump's transition period. A CBS News/YouGov poll found that 59% of voters approve of Trump's transition and 50% believe America's best days are ahead. Enten noted that Trump's net approval rating has jumped from +1 points to +18 points since his first transition in November 2016, indicating that Americans are giving him the 'benefit of the doubt.' Enten said, 'The bottom line is this, if 8 years ago people were lukewarm on Donald Trump, at this particular point they're giving him much more of the benefit of the doubt and a lot more Americans are in love with this transition.' Americans are more optimistic about Trump's upcoming presidency compared to 2016, with 53% now being 'excited or optimistic' and 46% being 'concerned' in December 2016. Enten further pointed out that a majority of Democrats (56%) said they either are not motivated to oppose Trump or support him, indicating that Democrats appear 'exhausted' from fighting against Trump and have become less motivated to stand in his opposition since 2016.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2024 03:26 PM\nSource:[The Daily Caller](https://dailycaller.com/2024/11/25/cnn-enten-trump-transition-approval/)\n\n**Dina Boluarte's Approval Rating Hits Record Low at 3% in Peru**\nAccording to Datum, the approval rating of Peruvian President Dina Boluarte has dropped to 3%, the lowest level of her presidency since she took office in December 2022. Her disapproval rating has increased to 94%, the highest in the world. The remaining 3% consists of Peruvians who are undecided or do not have a clear opinion about her leadership. Boluarte's approval rating began to decline drastically in November 2023, when it was at 11%. The disapproval rating has been increasing steadily since January 2024, reaching 91-92% in recent months. The low approval rating is attributed to various factors, including rising insecurity, economic crisis, and a perception of disconnection between the government and citizens. Datum's results also show that 80% of Peruvians distrust the prosecutors, 77% consider the judges inefficient, and 63% do not trust the National Police of Peru. As Boluarte said, 'the people consider me as someone who is out of touch with their needs.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 21, 2024 04:10 AM\nSource:[El Universal](https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/mundo/aprobacion-de-dina-boluarte-presidenta-de-peru-desciende-a-3-es-la-peor-evaluada-a-nivel-mundial-segun-reporte/)\n\n**America's Regressive Institutions: Weekly Update (11/17/2024)**\nCongressional approval is declining, with a slight increase in the percentage of people disapproving of Congress.

With two of the oldest justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, nearing retirement age, they may choose to step down, allowing Trump to nominate replacements who share their conservative philosophy. According to law professors Christopher Peters and Steven Schwinn, this presents an opportunity for Thomas and Alito to retire with the assurance that their successors would continue their judicial views. Schwinn also noted that the court's recent immunity ruling for Trump could 'affirmatively invite' a president to engage in illegal behavior, while also immunizing themselves. However, the court's approval ratings are at near-record lows, and there are perceived ethics questions surrounding the justices' luxury vacations paid for by Republican billionaires.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 03:59 AM\nSource:[UrduPoint](https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/us-supreme-court-a-check-or-an-enabler-of-se-1882511.html)\n\n**Supreme Court Approves Reform Limiting States' Debt Contracting Expenses**\nThe Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) approved a 2022 reform pushed by Morena that sets a limit on states and municipalities' additional expenses when contracting public debt. The reform, which was challenged by 44 opposition senators, was declared valid by the court in a public session. According to the reform, local governments can only allocate up to 0.15% of the financing amount to cover costs related to debt contracting, such as opening and disposal commissions, and costs for contracts with rating agencies and derivative instruments. As stated by Minister Luis María Aguilar Morales, 'the article 2, paragraph 2, of the Law of Financial Discipline of the Federal Entities and Municipalities, added by the decree published on May 10, 2022, in the Official Gazette of the Federation, is valid.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 12:06 PM\nSource:[La Jornada](https://www.jornada.com.mx/2024/11/13/politica/009n2pol)\n\n**Dissatisfaction with Supreme Court justices surges in Japan**\nA recent national review in Japan showed a surge in disapproval ratings for six Supreme Court justices, with four receiving over 10% disapproval. The chief justice, Yukihiko Imasaki, received the highest disapproval rating at 11.46%, likely due to his involvement in several high-profile cases concerning the rights of sexual minorities. An increase in available information about the justices and the influence of a popular morning drama series, 'Tora ni Tsubasa', may have contributed to the sudden rise in disapproval ratings. 'I used to think that trials and judges had little to do with me, but this time I found myself interested,' said a 30-year-old public servant from Aomori city, who credited the drama with sparking her newfound interest in the justices. 'This time, I felt I could make a decision based on my own criteria,' she added. No justice has been dismissed through this process, and critics say national reviews have become a mere formality. 'It's quite possible that the drama raised public interest,' said Shinichi Nishikawa, a professor of political science at Meiji University. 'For the 2024 review, major media outlets created special pages on their news sites to provide more comprehensive coverage, giving the public more opportunities to learn about the justices and their decisions.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 10:41 AM\nSource:[朝日新聞デジタル](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15503220)\n\n**Abbreviated Pundit Roundup: More introspection and analysis**\nRetired Supreme Court Justice David Souter's warning about democracy dying in the US due to lack of civic knowledge is still relevant today. The 2024 election was not about Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, but about the presidency of Joe Biden. If he had higher approval ratings, either he or Harris would have won. The Democrats should have a reckoning about becoming the party of the college-educated, which has affected their ability to message. Millions of ungettable GOP votes are set in stone due to years of marinating in complete craziness. The left needs to rebuild and grapple with the wreckage of 50 years of neoliberalism, which has left Americans adrift. The 2024 election was a cataclysm, with an electoral map wipeout and a Senate D practical ceiling of 52 seats. Republicans have a ceiling of 62 seats. The left needs to pick big fights and expand its tent to address the crisis of meaning and purpose fueling MAGA.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[dailykos.com](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/11/11/2285102/-Abbreviated-Pundit-Roundup-More-introspection-and-analysis?pm_campaign=front_page&pm_source=trending&pm_medium=web)\n\n**Democrats’ three big mistakes**\nThe US election results may seem to fit a global trend of voters rejecting incumbent leaders, but Kamala Harris could have bucked the trend. The US economy is performing well, with strong employment, rising wages, and decreasing inflation. Additionally, Donald Trump's weaknesses as a political figure, such as his low approval ratings, could have been exploited. According to a CNN poll, Trump's approval rating was as low as 34% after the January 6, 2021, incident, and his favorable rating sank to 31% in a CNN poll after the 2022 midterms, with an unfavorable rating of 60%. As a result, Republicans were disillusioned with him, and Ron DeSantis was outpolling Trump among Republicans in a Wall Street Journal poll in December 2022.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 11:11 PM\nSource:[financialchickens.com](https://financialchickens.com/democrats-three-big-mistakes/)\n\n**Milei's Positive Image Reaches 50%: Survey**\nA recent survey by Fundación Pensar found that the positive image of President Javier Milei has reached 50% and only 1 in 10 voters 'regrets' their vote. The survey, conducted in October 2024, showed that 49% of the population supports the government's plan, which has achieved some of the goals set during the campaign, such as reducing inflation and reducing state spending. The main asset of the government, according to the survey, is that Milei 'is doing the same thing he promised in the campaign'. 53% of the surveyed Argentines considered that the national government is 'better or equal to what they expected'. The government maintains the support of the vast majority of voters who supported its proposal in the runoff election last year. Milei will travel to the United States next week, with expectations of a meeting with Donald Trump. 'Very few voters regret their vote in the second round', the Foundation noted. Despite the critical economic and social context, the government has a solid approval rating, which grew from 45% in January to 49% in October 2024. One of the conclusions of the study is that Milei's image, fixed around 50% in the last measurement, is 'stable and deep'. 'In a context of recession, increase in tariffs and measures such as the veto to the increase in pensions, half of the population still maintains a positive image of the President', indicated from the Fundación Pensar.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 01:00 AM\nSource:[perfil.com](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/politica/encuesta-la-imagen-positiva-de-javier-milei-llega-al-50-y-solo-1-de-cada-10-votantes-esta-arrepentido.phtml)\n\n**5 de noviembre: A turning point for Mexico**\nToday, November 5, 2024, marks a turning point for Mexico. The country is at a crossroads, with a new government facing challenges in both politics and economics. The outcome of the US presidential election, between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, will have a significant impact on the relationship between the two countries and the Mexican economy. The Mexican government, led by President Claudia Sheinbaum, is facing a constitutional crisis, with the Supreme Court set to vote on a project of sentence that could invalidate part of the reform to the Judicial Power. The crisis could deepen if the project is approved, putting the government in a position to either accept or reject the court's decision. Additionally, the government is expected to present its first economic package on November 15, which will outline the plan to reduce the fiscal deficit from 5.9% to 3%. The credibility of the government's plan will determine whether credit rating agencies maintain or modify their ratings on Mexico. Furthermore, the government is planning to eliminate autonomous bodies, with the process set to begin on November 6. This move has raised concerns about the balance of power and democracy in Mexico.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 06:05 AM\nSource:[El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/opinion/5-noviembre-parteaguas-mexico-20241104-732863.html)\n\n**Mexicanos 'hacen montón' con Sheinbaum: ¿Qué porcentaje la apoya con la reforma judicial?**\nAccording to a recent survey, 49% of respondents consider Claudia Sheinbaum's handling of the judicial reform to be 'very good or good'. In contrast, 26% believe it has been 'bad or very bad'. The reform, which was approved 15 days before Sheinbaum's presidency, has been met with protests from judicial workers. Sheinbaum has called for the workers to return to work, assuring them that their rights will not be affected. The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has accepted a review of the reform, which is scheduled to be discussed on November 5. Sheinbaum has stated that she has a plan in place in case the court decides to reject the reform. The National Electoral Institute (INE) will also review the budget for the extraordinary election, which is expected to elect over 1,000 judges. Meanwhile, Sheinbaum has an approval rating of 70% after her first month in office, with 24% disapproving of her performance.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 12:29 AM\nSource:[elfinanciero.com.mx](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/encuestas-ef/2024/11/04/mexicanos-hacen-monton-con-sheinbaum-que-porcentaje-la-apoya-con-la-reforma-judicial/)\n\n**Win the vote but still lose? Behold America's Electoral College**\nThe US Electoral College system, established by the US Constitution in 1787, allows a presidential candidate to win the White House by securing an absolute majority of the 538 electors, rather than receiving the most popular votes. This system has led to five instances where the winner of the popular vote did not win the presidency, including Donald Trump's 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton. Trump described his win as 'beautiful,' despite Clinton receiving nearly three million more votes nationally. The system has been the subject of debate and proposed amendments, but none have succeeded. In the 2024 election, Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris will face off, and the Electoral College will once again be in focus. The electors, who are typically local officials or party leaders, will gather in their state capitals on December 17 to cast their votes for president and vice president. While some states require electors to respect the popular vote, others do not, and the Supreme Court has ruled that states can impose punishments on 'faithless electors' who do not follow the popular vote. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 01:14 AM\nSource:[The News International](https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1247123-win-the-vote-but-still-lose-behold-america-s-electoral-college)\n\n**Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation Ministers Resign in Protest of Constitutional Reform**\nIn a unprecedented move, the resignation letters of eight out of the 11 Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) ministers were made public, along with their decision not to run for re-election. The resignations also include those of magistrates Lilia Mónica López Benítez and José Alfonso Montalvo Martínez from the Federal Judiciary Council (CJF) and their decision not to participate in the 2025 popular election process for judges, magistrates, and ministers. The ministers' letters state that they are resigning due to congruence with the current constitutional text, but do not imply their approval of the constitutional amendment. SCJN President Norma Lucía Piña Hernández stated, 'This resignation does not imply my conformity with the separation of the position for which I was originally designated until December 10, 2030, but rather an act of congruence and respect for the constitutional text that currently governs us.' Other ministers, including Juan Luis González Alcántara Carrancá and Margarita Ríos Farjat, have also expressed their opposition to the reform. González Alcántara stated, 'I was mistaken in believing that a system of institutions, checks and balances would prevail, respecting the dignity of minorities. But I was mistaken. I was mistaken in believing that reason and freedom would prevail over the clamor of passions.' Ríos Farjat, on the other hand, announced that she will not accept her pension and will donate it to vulnerable children.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 12:36 PM\nSource:[La Jornada](https://www.jornada.com.mx/2024/10/31/politica/003n2pol)\n\n**US Election Poll: Trump Leads by Two Percentage Points**\nAccording to the latest poll results, Donald Trump is leading the US elections with 47% of the vote, followed by Kamala Harris with 45%. Trump's presidency has the highest approval rating, with 52% of respondents approving of his work as president, a record high since the poll began in 2022. In contrast, 54% of respondents disapprove of Kamala Harris' work as vice president, while 42% approve. The poll was conducted between October 19-22 with 750 respondents and has a margin of error of 3.6 percentage points. Trump's lead is significant among men, whites, and seniors, with 55% of people aged 65 or older, 53% of whites, and 52% of the middle class expressing favorability towards him.

Trump's approval rating has increased to 52%, with voters citing immigration, crime, and the economy as major issues. In contrast, Harris's approval rating has dropped, with voters questioning her stance on these issues. Trump's campaign has linked Harris to former President Joe Biden's policies, and Trump has emphasized his own mastery of immigration issues. The poll suggests that Trump's constant press conferences and claims of bringing change to the country's economic conditions have resonated with voters, who may prefer the 'unhinged' Trump over Harris's more cautious approach. As the elections approach, Harris is trying to attract undecided voters, but the outcome remains uncertain.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 09:07 AM\nSource:[blackstarnews.com](https://blackstarnews.com/wall-street-journal-poll-for-us-elections-2024/)\n\n**Iowans to vote to retain or remove Iowa Supreme Court Justice David May, other judges**\nIn the 2024 general election, Iowa voters will decide whether to retain or remove several judges, including Iowa Supreme Court Justice David May, four Iowa Court of Appeals judges, and 64 district court judges. According to the Iowa Judicial Branch, retention elections focus on judges' professional competency rather than their political opinions or controversial rulings. The Iowa State Bar Association (ISBA) released its 2024 Judicial Performance Review, rating each judge on their professional competency and overall demeanor. Notable ratings include: Justice David May, who received middle-of-the-road ratings, with 64.7% of attorneys surveyed saying they would vote to retain him; Judge Tyler Buller, who received 'above average' ratings, with 83.8% of respondents saying they would vote to retain him; Judge Mary Elizabeth Chicchelly, who received high ratings, with 94.5% of respondents saying they would vote to retain her; Judge Samuel Langholz, who received the lowest scores, with only 64% of respondents saying they would retain him; and Judge Mary Ellen Tabor, who received high ratings, with 94% of respondents saying they would vote to retain her.

The public is divided on rating the honesty and ethical standards of the justices, with 27% saying that the justices have very high or high standards, 38% rating their ethical standards as average, and 35% saying the justices’ ethical standards are low or very low. The proposal for justices to serve fixed terms, rather than the current system of appointments for life, is very popular, with 83% in favor and 17% opposed. Opinion is more closely divided on whether to increase the number of justices on the Court, with 54% in favor and 46% opposed. The belief that justices’ decisions are motivated mainly by politics has increased since 2019, with 55% now saying this. The public is at a low point in attention to news about the Court, with only 19% saying they have heard a lot about the Court in the last month. A majority of the public favors four of six recent prominent decisions, and opposes two. The parties are in greatest disagreement on presidential immunity and overturning Roe v. Wade. Confidence in the Court has declined, with 27% having a great deal or a lot of confidence, while 39% have little or no confidence. The perceived ideological leaning of the Court has shifted to the right since 2019, with fewer members of the public seeing the Court as moderate and more seeing it as conservative or very conservative.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2024 06:00 PM\nSource:[wislawjournal.com](https://wislawjournal.com/2024/10/18/marquette-law-school-poll-u-s-supreme-court-approval-edges-upward/)\n\n**Supreme Court trust 'edges upward' despite left-wing attacks: Polls - Washington Examiner**\nA recent poll from Marquette Law School found that 45% of adults approve of the Supreme Court justices' work, a two-point increase from July, while a separate survey from Gallup found that 48% of the public trusts the judicial branch.

With a 6-3 conservative majority, including three justices appointed by former President Donald Trump, there is a high prospect that the court could be asked to weigh in on cases before and potentially after the election. Election expert Nate Persily said, 'There's going to be something, I don't think they are going to hear a case before the election, but there will be attempts to draw them in.' The court has already announced 13 new cases it will decide in the coming months, including a bid by gun companies to throw out a lawsuit brought by Mexico seeking to hold them accountable for violence there. Meanwhile, the 2024 polls continue to show a presidential race that remains on a knife's edge, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump essentially tied in national polls and battleground states. Harris has a slightly greater advantage in the Great Lakes states of Michigan and Wisconsin, but those advantages are well within the boundaries of potential polling error. The polls also show that Harris has higher favorable ratings than Trump, after a sharp upswing in her numbers when she became a presidential candidate this summer.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 09:35 PM\nSource:[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/heated-election-season-supreme-court-new-term-politics-desk-rcna174368)\n\n**US Supreme Court returns with guns, transgender rights, online porn...**\nThe US Supreme Court has begun its 2024 fall term with a docket that includes gun regulation, transgender rights, and online porn. David Cole, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, expects a 'much quieter term' but notes that the presidential election could disrupt the court's proceedings. The justices will hear cases on ghost guns, gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth, and a Texas law requiring pornographic websites to verify the age of visitors. The court has also agreed to decide whether a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Mexico against American gunmakers can proceed. The Supreme Court's credibility has been eroding, with near-record-low approval ratings, particularly among Democrats.

However, the court's credibility is in the spotlight, with some experts believing that the justices' slim docket suggests they are 'making space for the possibility that there would be election cases that they would have to address.' The court's approval ratings are near record lows following controversial rulings and reports about ties between justices and the conservative movement. To regain its legitimacy, the court should do more to ensure its ethics code is followed, tone down its emphasis on originalist readings of the law, and justices should make a greater effort to avoid voting strictly along partisan lines. Kamala Harris has supported President Biden's call for Supreme Court reform, warning of a 'clear crisis of confidence' facing the institution. Critics of the court are 'cautiously optimistic' that Harris would be more proactive than Biden on reform, but sweeping changes would require Democrats to win control of the White House and both houses of Congress.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 05:33 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-supreme-court-begins-term-172237389.html)\n\n**Party Divisions in Views of Supreme Court Keep Ratings Low**\nThe U.S. Supreme Court's ratings remain near historical lows, with only 15% of Americans approving of the court's job performance and 24% trusting the institution. Democrats are driving the low ratings, with 82% believing the court is 'too conservative' and 37% having no trust at all in the judicial branch. Republicans, on the other hand, have a high approval rating of 72% and believe the court's political leanings are 'about right.' The party gap in trust and job approval has reached a record 47 points and 57 points, respectively. The court's image has not recovered since the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett in 2020 and the Dobbs decision in 2022, which overturned Roe v. Wade's finding of constitutional protections for abortion rights.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2024 08:00 AM\nSource:[Gallup.com](https://news.gallup.com/poll/651527/party-divisions-views-supreme-court-keep-ratings-low.aspx)\n\n**Kamala Harris' Approval Rating Reaches New High**\nA recent survey by 'Project 538' shows that a majority of Americans now have a positive opinion of Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate. This is a first for Harris, who had a negative image among 53.8% of Americans in July, while only 37.1% had a positive view of her. Harris' approval rating is now higher than that of her rival Donald Trump, who had a 45.7% positive rating. The survey was conducted after a TV debate between Harris' running mate Tim Walz and his Republican opponent J.D. Vance. Walz and Vance criticized each other's Iran policies, with Walz accusing Trump of being 'wankelmütig' (unreliable) and Vance defending Trump's record. 'It comes down to solid leadership,' Walz said. 'Donald Trump is unreliable. He will turn to whoever flatters him the most or where it suits him.' Vance responded that Trump had 'actually provided stability in the world through a effective deterrence.' \nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 29, 2024 01:48 PM\nSource:[t-online](https://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/ausland/usa/us-wahl/id_100499664/us-wahl-umfrage-mehrheit-aeussert-sich-erstmals-positiv-ueber-kamala-harris.html)\n\n**The Supreme Court, An American Crisis**\nThe US Supreme Court is facing a crisis, with only 18% of Americans expressing confidence in its integrity. A Monmouth University poll found that 6 in 10 Americans believe the Court is out of touch with the public. The Court's approval ratings have plummeted, with registered Republicans dropping from 80% in 2000 to 66% in 2024, and registered Democrats from 70% in 2000 to 15% in 2024. The erosion of faith in the Court is particularly pronounced among marginalized groups, with 52% of women, 61% of African Americans, and 50% of Hispanic Americans holding unfavorable views. Recent rulings, such as the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the elimination of affirmative action in college admissions, have further eroded trust in the Court. Dr. Bridgeforth writes, 'What kind of judicial system allows its members to operate under a veil of ethical ambiguity? The answer is clear: a Court that has strayed far from its foundational principles, increasingly exhibiting behavior that mirrors partisan politics rather than impartial justice.' The Court's handling of redistricting in South Carolina and its complicity in systemic racism have also been criticized. Dr. Bridgeforth concludes, 'The Supreme Court risks becoming a symbol of division rather than a beacon of justice, an outcome that would fundamentally undermine the foundational principles upon which our democracy stands.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 05:40 PM\nSource:[The Black Wall Street Times](https://theblackwallsttimes.com/2024/09/23/the-supreme-court-an-american-crisis)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

With a tight deadline to fund the government by December 20, Congress will focus on passing a complex spending package and enacting healthcare legislation. Key issues to watch include: Medicare physician pay, with doctors facing a 24% pay cut since 2000 and a potential 4.7% payment update in 2025; banning Chinese biotechnology companies and TikTok; priority review vouchers for rare pediatric drugs; telehealth in Medicare, with a potential expiration of expanded coverage on December 31; and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) reform and kids' online safety.

UU.**\nA recent proposal in the US House of Representatives aims to eliminate Social Security benefits for immigrants. This measure, backed by the House, could mark the end of a crucial benefit for many who reside in the country. The Social Security Equity Act has sparked concern, especially among Latinos, who could see their benefits significantly reduced. The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) has been a contentious issue, as its implementation could result in a substantial loss of benefits for those who have not reached the 30-year work requirement to access the full Social Security amount in the US. This situation has sparked a debate over the equity of the system and its impact on vulnerable communities. The proposal has been approved in the House, but still needs Senate approval and the President's signature to become law. If implemented, the changes would affect benefits approved from December 2024 onwards. It is crucial that immigrants are aware of these dates and prepare for the possible repercussions. Many immigrants, who often lack the necessary years of work, could face a reduction of up to 50% in their payments. This is especially concerning for those who receive pensions from their countries of origin. It is advised that immigrants check if their countries of origin have agreements with the US that facilitate the combination of work periods. This could help mitigate the impact of the new law and ensure they can access the benefits they are entitled to. The lack of information and preparation can exacerbate the situation for those who rely on Social Security.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 21, 2024 11:07 PM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/estados-unidos/2024/11/21/malas-noticias-para-inmigrantes-en-usa-la-ultima-fecha-del-pago-del-seguro-social-antes-que-llegue-a-su-fin-en-ee-uu-lrtmus-940023)\n\n**Trump's approval rating now 20 points higher as president-elect**\nA recent Harvard CAPS/Harris poll found that 54% of Americans approve of President-elect Trump's job performance, while 40% disapprove.

The telehealth flexibilities, which were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, are set to expire at the end of the year. Several bills have been introduced to extend these flexibilities, including H.R. 7623, 'The Telehealth Modernization Act of 2024,' which was voted unanimously out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee in August. PBM Reform is also a priority, with several pieces of legislation making it through markup, including H.R. 5378, 'Lower Costs, More Transparency Act,' which passed the House with strong bipartisan support in December 2023. The RPD PRV program, which offers incentives to companies for developing therapies for rare pediatric diseases, is set to expire at the end of the year without a further extension or reauthorization. H.R. 7384 / S. 4583, 'Creating Hope Reauthorization Act of 2024,' is bipartisan legislation that would extend until FY2029 the voucher program. Additionally, the BIOSECURE Act, which would prohibit federal agencies from procuring or obtaining any biotechnology equipment or service produced or provided by a biotechnology company of concern, has strong support in both chambers and is likely to be signed into law by the end of the year. The Medicare Physician Payment Fix is also a priority, with several bills introduced to address the proposed 2.8% Medicare physician cuts, including H.R. 10073, which would provide physicians with a 4.73% payment increase in 2025 to offset the cuts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 02:51 PM\nSource:[natlawreview.com](https://natlawreview.com/article/health-policy-expected-movements-lame-duck-session-novemberdecember-2024)\n\n**The Remainder of the Year in Congress**\nWhen Congress returns to Washington on November 12, they will face a number of outstanding items, including government funding which will expire on December 20 if not addressed.

The Telehealth Modernization Act (H.R. 7623) has been approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee to extend expiring telehealth flexibilities for an additional two years. The Lower Costs, More Transparency Act (H.R. 5378) passed the House with bipartisan support in December 2023, aiming to enhance PBM transparency. Physicians are likely to petition Congress for relief from the 2.93 percent payment reduction to Medicare enrollees for 2025.

The Senate Armed Services Committee's version of the NDAA includes extensions of the FAA 'learning period' that prohibits new commercial human spaceflight regulations and third-party indemnification to January and September 2028 respectively. NASA authorization and commercial space/mission authorization bills could also be added to the NDAA. The exemption Congress gave NASA from the Iran-North Korea-Syria Nonproliferation Act (INKSNA) expires in December 2025, and NASA is working on a new agreement to maintain and operate the International Space Station safely.

The survey, conducted in October 2024, showed that 49% of the population supports the government's plan, which has achieved some of the goals set during the campaign, such as reducing inflation and reducing state spending. The main asset of the government, according to the survey, is that Milei 'is doing the same thing he promised in the campaign'. 53% of the surveyed Argentines considered that the national government is 'better or equal to what they expected'. The government maintains the support of the vast majority of voters who supported its proposal in the runoff election last year. Milei will travel to the United States next week, with expectations of a meeting with Donald Trump. 'Very few voters regret their vote in the second round', the Foundation noted. Despite the critical economic and social context, the government has a solid approval rating, which grew from 45% in January to 49% in October 2024. One of the conclusions of the study is that Milei's image, fixed around 50% in the last measurement, is 'stable and deep'.

History shows that even in the face of a strong opposition, Democrats can regain control of Congress and pass legislation. The Senate dynamics are crucial, with Republicans currently holding a 52-48 majority, which could expand to 53-47 or 54-46. A narrower majority could allow Democrats to block Trump's cabinet picks and initiatives, as seen in the past with Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins.

To understand the current state of the election, it's essential to look at the polls and their limitations. FiveThirtyEight aggregates national approval ratings for the presidential candidates, but even these averages are not precise predictions. Past elections have shown that polls and predictions have limited accuracy in the US. The 2016 election was a prime example, with many institutes predicting a landslide victory for Hillary Clinton, but the actual outcome was different. The 2020 election also had a close outcome, but the winner, Joe Biden, was correctly predicted. The election on November 5 will not only determine the next president but also the balance of power in the US Congress. The Electoral College will meet on December 17 to cast their votes, and the official results will be announced on January 6, 2025. To win the presidency, a candidate needs to secure a majority of the 538 electoral votes. The number of electoral votes each state receives is based on its population and the number of senators and representatives it has in Congress. Some states have a 'winner takes all' system, where the winner receives all the electoral votes, while others, like Nebraska and Maine, allocate their electoral votes based on congressional districts. The outcome of the election will depend on various factors, including the number of mail-in ballots and the timing of their counting. In some states, mail-in ballots can be counted immediately, while in others, they can only be counted on election day or later. This can lead to delays in the counting process and make it difficult to predict the outcome of the election. \nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 04:00 PM\nSource:[rnd.de](https://www.rnd.de/politik/ergebnisse-der-us-wahl-2024-grafiken-karte-informationen-stand-5-november-GXXAV5WLIJD4NM2UZGQFAXSE6M.html)\n\n**538's final forecasts for the 2024 election**\nAccording to 538's final election forecasts, the presidency and House of Representatives are toss-ups, while the GOP is likely to win the Senate.

Voters will choose between candidates for the presidency, the House of Representatives, and the Senate. The election will also determine the composition of state legislatures, with 85 of the 99 state legislatures holding elections. The Republican Party, which currently controls the House of Representatives, may retain a narrow majority in the lower chamber and regain control of the Senate. If Donald Trump wins the election, he will have a majority in Congress, repeating the scenario of his first term (2017-2019). The election will also determine the outcome of the presidential election, with the winner being determined by the Electoral College. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, with each state having a number of electors equal to its number of Representatives in Congress. The electors will meet in their respective states to cast their votes for president and vice-president on December 17. The votes will then be counted by Congress on January 6, 2025, and the winner will be declared. The election process is complex, with multiple dates and deadlines, including November 5, December 11, December 17, and January 6. The outcome of the election is uncertain, with several swing states having laws establishing automatic recounts in the event of a close election. The risk of election disputes and allegations of 'fraud' is also a concern, with Donald Trump having already begun to spread false information about potential election fraud in Pennsylvania.

In the US, citizens do not directly vote for the president and vice president, but for the electors. There are a total of 538 electors, distributed based on the population of each state, plus three representatives from the District of Columbia, which will officially elect the president. The candidate who receives at least 270 votes wins the election. According to the Electoral Count Act of 1877, states have a five-week period after the election (until December 11) to resolve any disputes related to the election before the Electoral College meets on December 17. Then, on January 6, 2025, the electoral votes will be officially counted during a joint session of Congress, and the Senate President will announce the election results. The winner will take office at the White House on January 20, 2025. The latest polls show that the race between the two candidates is closer than ever, with Kamala Harris's lead over Donald Trump narrowing to less than one percentage point, according to the New York Times. The challenges in key states (Swing States) remain tight, with no candidate holding a significant advantage in the seven most likely states to decide the presidency, writes the NYT. As the NYT notes, when the national vote is tied, it is not a good omen for Democrats, as Trump did better in key states than nationally in the two previous elections, allowing him to win in 2016 without winning the national popular vote and narrowly losing to Joe Biden in 2020.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 02:55 PM\nSource:[Fanpage](https://www.fanpage.it/esteri/quando-ci-saranno-le-elezioni-usa-2024-la-data-e-cosa-dicono-gli-ultimi-sondaggi-sulla-sfida-trump-harris/)\n\n**Dominican Congress Approves Loans Worth Over 37,000 Million Pesos**\nThe Dominican Congress has sent to the Senate a loan agreement with the Official Credit Institute of the Kingdom of Spain, worth approximately 1,200 million Dominican pesos, to finance the Integral and Sustainable Management of Solid Waste in Greater Santo Domingo. The loan is part of a package of loans totaling over 37,000 million pesos, which will be used to improve the country's energy distribution and mitigate the effects of climate change. The loans were approved by the Congress, but sparked a heated debate between the ruling party and opposition parties, with some lawmakers warning that the debt will burden future generations. 'Our children will have to pay for this', said lawmakers from the Liberation Party and other opposition groups. The president of the Finance Commission, Frank Paulino, defended the loan, saying it will benefit the Dominican society. The largest loan, worth $300 million, was agreed with the Inter-American Development Bank in December 2023, and will be used to promote economic growth and protect against climate change. The loan has a value of approximately 18,000 million pesos, and will be repaid between 2028 and 2043. The loan is divided into two installments, with the first payment due in 2029 and the last payment in 2044. Additionally, the Dominican government has agreed to a loan with the French Development Agency, worth $100 million, and a loan with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, worth $225 million, to improve the country's electricity distribution network.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 09:05 PM\nSource:[Listin diario](https://listindiario.com/la-republica/congreso/20241023/diputados-envian-senado-prestamos-mas-37-mil-millones-pesos-ejecutivo_830681.html)\n\n**How 538's 2024 Senate election forecast works**\nFiveThirtyEight's 2024 Senate election forecast combines polling averages, quantitative data, and qualitative ratings to predict the outcome of each Senate race. The model starts with polling averages, adjusted for factors such as pollster rating, mode of the interview, and partisan sponsorship. It then incorporates quantitative data, including partisan lean, incumbency, candidate fundraising, and polarization. The model also uses qualitative ratings from experts at Sabato's Crystal Ball, the Cook Political Report, and Inside Elections to fill in gaps and provide additional information. The final forecast is a weighted average of the polls, fundamentals, and expert ratings, with the weights depending on the number of polls available for each seat. The model also simulates uncertainty, accounting for national, regional, and state-level error, and provides a range of outcomes for each contest. According to the model, there are about 7 points of error on the margin between candidates in each seat, with 4.8 points of error at the national level, 2.8 at the regional level, and 4.8 on the state level. The model also allows for state-level error to be higher in states further away from an even partisan lean, higher in seats with no polls, higher in seats with 'Solid' or 'Safe' race ratings, and higher in seats where the polls disagree more with the fundamentals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 08:21 PM\nSource:[go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/538/538s-2024-senate-election-forecast-works/story?id=114997770)\n\n**How 538's 2024 House election forecast works**\n538's 2024 House election forecast combines polling data with quantitative and qualitative data to predict the outcome of each congressional district. The forecast starts by calculating an average of generic ballot polls, which are then adjusted for pollster rating and methodology. In addition to polls, the forecast incorporates district-specific factors such as partisan lean, which is calculated by taking a weighted blend of the district's vote in the most recent and second-most recent presidential election. The forecast also uses regression models to predict support for third-party candidates and individual candidates in races with multiple candidates from the same party. To fill in gaps in the data, the forecast incorporates qualitative race ratings from experts at Sabato's Crystal Ball, the Cook Political Report, and Inside Elections. The final weights of the model depend on the number of polls available for each seat, with more weight given to polls in competitive districts. The forecast also accounts for uncertainty by quantifying prediction error from five sources: national error, regional error, demographic-cluster error, state-specific error, and idiosyncratic error. The total expected error is about 8 points on the margin between candidates in each seat.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2024 12:15 AM\nSource:[ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/538/538s-2024-house-election-forecast-works/story?id=114446291)\n\n**Senate targets budget approval by mid-December at the latest**\nThe Senate plans to approve the proposed P6.352-trillion national budget for 2025 by the second week of December at the latest, according to Senate President Francis G.

The bill, which was approved with a 341-82 House vote and a 78-18 Senate vote, will keep the federal government running through Dec. 20. House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole said, 'In a matter of days, funding for fiscal year 2024 will run out and it's Congress' responsibility to ensure that the government remains open and serving the American people.' Connecticut Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro emphasized the need for bipartisan agreement on the full-year spending bills, saying, 'No matter who wins in November, we owe it to the next Congress and the next president to not saddle them with yesterday's problems.' The stopgap bill extends funding levels and policies approved earlier this year, including a provision allowing the Secret Service to spend money at a faster rate for protective operations.

It does not include additional funding for disaster relief or the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The index has been in a bullish trend since October 2023, with a breakout above the trigger mark of 2,100 points. This has triggered a buy signal, leading to a rally towards the 2021 highs.

Republicans, including Vance, are focused on getting former President Donald Trump back to the White House in 2024, but Vance's debate performance has reinforced his position as the natural heir to the movement Trump started. 'He has definitely put himself, in my opinion, not only as the frontrunner for 2028 but the face of the new generation for the Republican Party,' said Mike Hartley, an Ohio-based GOP consultant. Vance's affability surprised many who are accustomed to seeing a more combative, controversial candidate on the campaign trail. 'The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact check,' Vance said, in a moment that showed vestiges of his previous behavior. For the most part, however, Vance gave off Midwest nice and sought to paint himself as relatable, humanizing the issue of reproductive health by invoking a woman he knows who sought an abortion because she was in an abusive relationship. 'As a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable is that my party, we've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue where they frankly just don't trust us,' he said. Vance's campaign said that he is focused on making sure Trump is re-elected in 2024, and that 2028 is not on his mind.

According to Politico, Harris has instructed her aides and close associates to explore all possible options, including running for president and governor of California. Harris has told her aides that she 'will continue to fight', and plans to discuss her future plans with her family during the winter holidays. Harris became a presidential candidate less than 100 days before the election, after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. 'There's no one, no one, who really understands what she's been through over the last four months,' said sociologist Paul Maslin. Harris received 226 electoral votes, while Republican Donald Trump received 312.

Vice President Kamala Harris faced an unpopular administration with a 39% approval rating, which has historically led to a loss in elections. Additionally, consumer sentiment was low, with a 70.1 rating, which has also been a predictor of election losses. Despite these challenges, Harris improved upon Biden's performance in 2020 in a few areas, but Trump improved with a wider range of demographics, including Latino men, voters aged 18-29, and suburban voters. However, the election was not a 49-state victory, and the popular vote difference between Trump and Harris will be within a few percentage points.

According to a recent NBC poll, President Biden's approval rating stands at 43 per cent, and only 25 per cent of Americans believe his policies are beneficial for their families. Harris must navigate these obstacles to connect with voters looking for change or new ideas, particularly in swing states like Michigan, where her support among Arab Americans is nearly on par with Donald Trump's. As the first Black, South Asian, and female vice-presidential candidate, Harris faces heightened expectations to represent minority communities, which can be difficult to satisfy across diverse interests. 'Without strong support for Biden's record, Harris may find it challenging to present the administration's policies as positive,' said a recent NBC poll. 'Regaining trust with these voters will be essential for success in these critical regions,' added the article. A Harris victory may encounter resistance from Trump and his supporters, who could spread claims of election fraud, leading to confusion and eroding public trust in the election process.

Initially, Harris was leading Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election polls, but now she is losing support. According to Steve Kornacki, an expert from NBC-News, Harris' 5-point lead from previous polls has disappeared, and Trump is now leading in six out of seven key states, albeit narrowly. The public perception of Harris has significantly declined: only 43% now view her positively, compared to 48% a month ago. In contrast, Trump's positive rating has increased to 43%. This is a surprising result, considering that most media outlets have reported positively about Harris and negatively about Trump.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 08:00 AM\nSource:[achgut.com](https://www.achgut.com/artikel/gegenwind_fuer_kamala_harris)\n\n**WATCH: MSNBC breaks down Kamala's plunge in popularity as Election Day approaches * WorldNetDaily * by Joe Kovacs**\nAccording to a recent poll, Vice President Kamala Harris' popularity has declined significantly ahead of the 2024 election. Her positive rating dropped from 48% in September to 43% in October, while her negative rating increased from 45% to 49%. This shift has led to a tie with Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has a 43% positive rating and a 51% negative rating. The poll also found that Trump's retrospective approval rating is 5 points higher than President Joe Biden's, indicating that Harris is being weighed down by being part of an unpopular administration. As Kornacki said, 'The shift is here, it's with Harris, 43% positive, 49% negative. When we took that last poll a month ago, she was actually above water. She had a 48% positive rating and a 45% negative rating. There was a clear advantage for her a month ago on basic image, basic likability, basic perception over Donald Trump. That advantage, in our poll at least, has gone away in a month for her.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 03:50 PM\nSource:[WND](https://www.wnd.com/2024/10/watch-msnbc-breaks-down-kamalas-plunge-in-popularity-as-election-day-approaches/)\n\n**MSNBC's Steve Kornacki Breaks Down Kamala Harris' Decline In Popularity As Election Day Approaches**\nMSNBC's Steve Kornacki analyzed Vice President Kamala Harris' declining popularity in recent polling ahead of the 2024 election. Harris' positive rating dropped to 43% in October, a 5-point decrease from September, while her negative rating increased to 49%. Kornacki noted that Harris' advantage over Donald Trump in basic image and likability has 'gone away' in a month. The poll shows Trump and Harris are currently tied 48% to 48%, a decline for Harris who previously led.

The survey also found that more Americans view the Trump Administration more favorably than the Biden Administration. Kamala Harris, who saw a significant boost in approval ratings following President Joe Biden's exit from the race, is now hemorrhaging votes as Americans shift away from her campaign. 'As summer has turned to fall, any signs of momentum for Kamala Harris have stopped,' Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt said. 'The race is a dead heat.' Harris is losing momentum among voters significantly, as experts say she needs a six-point lead to win the election. Trump takes the lead on critical issues most important to voters, such as the economy, inflation, immigration, and handling the conflict in the Middle East.

Rather, it was an ordinary election, with little change from 2016. According to political scientists John Sides, Chris Tausanovitch, and Lynn Vavreck, national politics has been 'calcified,' with two equal-sized coalitions at loggerheads, resulting in repeat elections. Despite President Biden's low approval rating and voters' top concerns being the economy and immigration, which favored the GOP, Vice President Harris won 48.1%, beating Biden's approval by a wide margin and holding Trump to below 51%. Matthew Dowd notes that no modern incumbent president or vice president has run in the popular vote ahead of the president's approval rating until now. The election results mainly reaffirm voters' persistent anti-incumbent sentiment, and Republicans may be tempted to claim a stronger mandate than the voters intended, leading to policies that are more extreme and disruptive than the public wants.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 08:11 PM\nSource:[Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/an-ordinary-election/)\n\n**Biden vs. Trump latest approval ratings: Who is more popular?**\nA week after his election victory, President-elect Donald Trump remains more popular than President Joe Biden, according to the latest tracking of poll averages.

Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, attributes the decline to negative media coverage and scrutiny of Biden's performance as an advocate for Kamala Harris. Reeher notes that Biden's legacy will not be significantly impacted by his slipping approval ratings, but rather by his decision to step down as the nominee at the 11th hour and the events leading up to that. The country has faced decades-high levels of inflation during Biden's time in office, which has been cited as a key reason voters backed Trump over Harris in the 2024 election.

Bush's in the final stages of his second term in office.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 06:08 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-popularity-sliding-fall-historic-low-1983696)\n\n**Biden's Approval Ratings Fall Ahead of US Election**\nUS President Joe Biden's approval ratings have fallen in the past two months, dropping from 42% in September to 38.5% currently, according to fivethirtyeight.com.

To understand the current state of the election, it's essential to look at the polls and their limitations. FiveThirtyEight aggregates national approval ratings for the presidential candidates, but even these averages are not precise predictions. Past elections have shown that polls and predictions have limited accuracy in the US. The 2016 election was a prime example, with many institutes predicting a landslide victory for Hillary Clinton, but the actual outcome was different. The 2020 election also had a close outcome, but the winner, Joe Biden, was correctly predicted. The election on November 5 will not only determine the next president but also the balance of power in the US Congress. The Electoral College will meet on December 17 to cast their votes, and the official results will be announced on January 6, 2025. To win the presidency, a candidate needs to secure a majority of the 538 electoral votes. The number of electoral votes each state receives is based on its population and the number of senators and representatives it has in Congress. Some states have a 'winner takes all' system, where the winner receives all the electoral votes, while others, like Nebraska and Maine, allocate their electoral votes based on congressional districts. The outcome of the election will depend on various factors, including the number of mail-in ballots and the timing of their counting. In some states, mail-in ballots can be counted immediately, while in others, they can only be counted on election day or later. This can lead to delays in the counting process and make it difficult to predict the outcome of the election. \nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 04:00 PM\nSource:[rnd.de](https://www.rnd.de/politik/ergebnisse-der-us-wahl-2024-grafiken-karte-informationen-stand-5-november-GXXAV5WLIJD4NM2UZGQFAXSE6M.html)\n\n**Why Is the US Presidential Race Even Close?**\nThe 2024 US presidential election is a close contest due to several factors. For Democrats, the incumbent party's nominee, Kamala Harris, is facing strong electoral headwinds, with President Joe Biden's low approval rating of 39% (according to Gallup) and the party's struggles with issues such as Ukraine, Gaza, and migrants crossing the southern border. Harris's approval rating as vice president is 45%, six points higher than Biden's. On the other hand, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has managed to center the election on himself, thrilling many voters while appalling many others. Trump's high unfavorability rating and low favorability rating since 2016 have made him a polarizing figure. The resistance to Trump has remained consistently high, with his Gallup approval rating never cracking 50% while in office. The American electorate's decision is being influenced by both quotidian concerns and Trump's outsize personality, with hundreds of thousands of voters putting aside their party loyalty and policy priorities to stand against a candidate they consider unfit for the presidency. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2024 06:48 PM\nSource:[enewspolar.com](https://enewspolar.com/why-is-the-us-presidential-race-even-close/)\n\n**Three Indicators Suggesting a Trump Victory: 'You Won't Be Able to Say You Weren't Warned'**\nAccording to data analyst Harry Enten, three indicators could be unfavorable to Democrats. Enten, a leading data analyst at CNN, presented a segment on Wednesday, October 30, 2024, highlighting three elements that he considers 'obvious' signs of a potential Donald Trump victory in the presidential election. If Trump wins the election, 'you won't be able to say you weren't warned,' he told viewers.

Harris has been consistently declining Biden's requests for joint campaign appearances, leaving many to speculate about the tension between the two leaders. Harris has emphasized, 'My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency,' during a recent interview, aiming to show voters her distinct vision for the future. Despite this, the White House has stated that they remain in close communication with Harris' campaign to determine how Biden can assist. Harris faces pressure from both Democratic strategists and voters to separate her image from Biden's, asserting her independence. According to RealClearPolitics, Biden's approval rating is struggling, sitting at 40.8% approval and 56.6% disapproval. Harris has consistently defended Biden in public, but behind the scenes, there is speculation that if she wins on November 5, she may overhaul her staff, which has led to some Biden loyalists feeling uneasy about their roles.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 07:15 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/biden-proposed-her-name-as-democratic-party-candidate-for-u-s-elections-but-kamala-harris-repeatedly-snubs-his-requests-to-campaign/articleshow/114704658.cms)\n\n**Biden to Cast His Vote in Early Voting, but Campaign with Harris Remains Uncertain**\nThe White House announced that US President Joe Biden will cast his vote in the early voting for the US elections today. According to Axios, Biden wanted to campaign with his running mate and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in the days leading up to the election, but her campaign has not agreed to this. Harris' campaign has repeatedly told Biden that they will 'follow up with him'. Sources close to Axios said that Biden's team had scheduled time for campaign events, but Harris' team has not taken advantage of these opportunities. Harris' campaign believes that Biden is a political liability at a critical moment in the campaign, but they are hesitant to say so directly. One source described the situation as a 'slow separation' between two partners, as Harris' team and allies value Biden's services but are wary of associating Harris with the president, who has low public approval ratings. Biden's approval rating is at 39%, according to a poll average tracked by 538. A source said that Biden is reminding people of his past four years in office, rather than 'the new path forward'. There are currently no scheduled campaign events that bring Biden and Harris together before the November 5 election. Harris' aides have privately expressed frustration with Biden's focus on his own campaign rather than the presidential race that Harris is running in. Harris has faced increasing pressure in recent days to explain to voters how she would lead the country differently from Biden if she wins the presidency.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 02:42 AM\nSource:[mn2ol.com](https://www.mn2ol.com/Egypt/2210879)\n\n**CNN's Harry Enten Says Biden's 'Disapproval Rating' May Spell Doom For Harris' Election Bid**\nCNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said that President Joe Biden's low approval rating of 36% could signal a loss for Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming election. Historically, past presidents with net negative approval ratings have not been followed by a successor from their own party. Enten noted that presidents with negative approval ratings, such as Harry Truman and Lyndon Baines Johnson, were not succeeded by a Democrat. Enten said, 'Can Joe Biden actually be succeeded by a Democrat? Can Kamala Harris overcome Joe Biden's net negative approval rating? Only time will tell, but history ain't so kind, guys.'

Trump's approval rating has increased to 52%, with voters citing immigration, crime, and the economy as major issues. In contrast, Harris's approval rating has dropped, with voters questioning her stance on these issues. Trump's campaign has linked Harris to former President Joe Biden's policies, and Trump has emphasized his own mastery of immigration issues. The poll suggests that Trump's constant press conferences and claims of bringing change to the country's economic conditions have resonated with voters, who may prefer the 'unhinged' Trump over Harris's more cautious approach.

The child reportedly experienced mild symptoms and received antiviral treatment for the flu. According to the CDC, 'In line with previously identified human cases in the US, the child apparently experienced mild symptoms and received antivirals against the flu.' The initial sample collected showed low levels of viral material, and follow-up tests on the child several days later were negative for avian flu H5 but positive for common respiratory viruses. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is conducting a study to determine the possible cause of the child's exposure to H5N1. The child is recovering, and the study found that all household members reported symptoms and were tested, with all results negative for avian flu H5 and several family members positive for the same common respiratory viruses. Contact tracing is ongoing, but there is currently no evidence of person-to-person transmission of H5N1 from the child to others. The CDC is closely monitoring data from flu surveillance systems, particularly in states affected by animal outbreaks, such as California, where there have been widespread outbreaks of avian flu H5N1 in wild and domestic birds since 2022 and in cattle since August 2024. The CDC confirmed that sporadic and limited human infections with the H5N1 virus, where no animal exposure was detected, are rare and sporadic.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 25, 2024 10:00 PM\nSource:[diariopresente.mx](https://www.diariopresente.mx/mundo/estados-unidos-presenta-caso-de-gripe-aviar/410043)\n\n**CDC Confirms First Case of H5N1 Bird Flu in a Child in California; Will the Infection Spread to the General Public?**\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed the first case of H5N1 bird flu in a child in California. Despite having no known contact with infected animals, the child tested positive for the flu. The CDC has stated that the risk of the virus spreading to the general public is low, and no evidence of person-to-person transmission has been found. The child's household members who showed symptoms were tested, but all came back negative for bird flu. However, some family members tested positive for the same respiratory virus as the child.

Since April 2024, CDC has confirmed 52 human cases of H5N1 bird flu, with 21 cases associated with exposure to infected poultry and 30 cases associated with exposure to infected dairy cows. The source of exposure in one case could not be determined. All recent cases have occurred in workers on affected farms, with mild symptoms such as eye redness or discharge. CDC believes the immediate risk to the general public from H5 bird flu remains low, but people with exposure to infected animals are at higher risk of infection. The CDC recommends oseltamivir for treatment of patients with H5N1 and for post-exposure prophylaxis of close contacts of confirmed H5N1 patients. Influenza genetic sequence data from recent cases have been posted in GISAID and GenBank. CDC continues to support states in monitoring people with exposure to infected animals and has tested over 7,300 people as a result of their exposure. More than 60,000 specimens have been tested for avian influenza A(H5) virus or other novel influenza viruses at public health labs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2024 04:27 AM\nSource:[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-11152024.html)\n\n**US Reports First Case of Child Infected with H5N1 Bird Flu Virus**\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported the first case of a child infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus. The case was detected in California, and experts are investigating how the child contracted the infection. According to the CDC, the child had mild symptoms and was receiving antiviral medication. The child's family members reported symptoms and underwent testing, with all members except the child testing negative for the H5N1 virus. However, some family members tested positive for other common respiratory viruses. The CDC stated that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus. Since April 2024, 52 cases of human infection have been confirmed, with 21 cases attributed to contact with infected birds, 30 cases attributed to contact with infected cattle, and the cause of infection unknown in one case. The CDC also reported that there have been no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus. Additionally, the US Department of Agriculture has confirmed the infection of over 25 million birds and 505 dairy farms in 15 states since March 2024. The CDC recommends maintaining a safe distance from infected animals, drinking pasteurized milk, avoiding raw eggs, and avoiding contact with animal feces and materials that may have come into contact with infected animals. The main symptoms of the H5N1 virus appear quickly, within 3-5 days, and include high fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, cough, and shortness of breath.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: November 24, 2024 07:09 AM\nSource:[24tv.ua](https://zdorovya.24tv.ua/ptashiniy-grip-h5n1-viyavileno-pershiy-vipadok-zarazhennya-ditini_n2692698)\n\n**Avian Influenza in a Child: A Warning from Dr. Matteo Bassetti**\nA child in the United States has tested positive for the H5N1 avian influenza virus for the first time. The child, who lives in Alameda County near San Francisco Bay, has mild symptoms and is receiving antiviral treatment at home, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and California health authorities. The child had a low level of the virus, indicating it was likely not infectious when detected. The child tested negative four days after the initial positive result. Dr. Matteo Bassetti, an infectious disease specialist at San Martino Hospital in Genoa, notes that the child likely contracted the virus from a bird, unlike previous cases in the US this year, which were mostly among poultry farmers. Bassetti warns that the virus is changing and mutating, and that the 55 cases in the US this year make it the largest H5N1 epidemic since it was first described in Hong Kong in 1997. 'This virus has passed through a variety of animals, including mammals, and is getting closer to humans,' Bassetti says. 'The next step will be human-to-human transmission, which will happen sooner or later.' Bassetti emphasizes the need for vigilance and notes that the virus is now closer to humans than it was a year ago. 'We must not underestimate the risk of a pandemic,' he says.

Experts remain vigilant about the possibility of a virus mutation that could facilitate human-to-human transmission, despite the current rarity of human cases.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 22, 2024 09:23 PM\nSource:[RTBF](https://www.rtbf.be/article/etats-unis-un-premier-cas-de-grippe-aviaire-detecte-chez-un-enfant-aux-etats-unis-11467338)\n\n**First Pediatric Case of H5N1 Avian Influenza in the US**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Cdc) have confirmed a human infection with the A H5N1 virus in a child in California. The child, who experienced mild symptoms, received antiviral flu medication and is recovering. An investigation by the California Department of Public Health (Cdph) is underway to determine the possible source of the child's exposure to the H5N1 virus. The child's family members have also been tested and found to be negative for the H5N1 virus, but positive for common respiratory viruses. 'To date, no person-to-person transmission of H5N1 avian influenza has been identified in any of the cases reported in the United States,' said the Cdc. This case was detected through flu testing and reported to the California department through the national influenza surveillance system. It is the second human case identified in the US. The Cdc continues to monitor the data, particularly in states affected by animal epidemics, such as California, where widespread outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza have been detected in wild birds and domestic poultry since 2022 and in dairy herds since August 2024. 'These cases highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance and investigations at the local, state, and federal levels,' said the experts. Including this recent case, there have been 55 human cases of H5 avian influenza reported in the US in 2024, with 29 in California. The Cdc's risk assessment for the general public remains 'low.' However, people exposed to infected or potentially infected animals, such as birds, dairy cattle, or other animals, or to contaminated environments, are at higher risk of infection. The Cdc recommends avoiding unprotected exposure to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domestic birds, and other wild or domestic animals (including cows).\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 22, 2024 08:27 PM\nSource:[quotidianodibari.it](https://quotidianodibari.it/aviaria-primo-caso-virus-h5n1-in-un-bambino-negli-usa/)\n\n**First Pediatric Case of H5 Avian Influenza in the US: A Child Infected in California**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Cdc) have confirmed a human infection with the A H5N1 virus in a child in California.

This is a change from the previous recommendation, which only advised antiviral treatment for people with suspected H5N1 symptoms. The CDC also recommends testing exposed workers, even if they do not show symptoms. A new CDC study found that half of the workers who tested positive for H5N1 did not remember having symptoms. The study suggests that the previous strategy of only monitoring symptoms and testing workers who reported being ill was not sufficient. 'Although we have not observed changes in the virus that suggest the ability to transmit from person to person, we want to keep this risk as low as it is now,' said Nirav Shah, CDC deputy director. 'One of the best ways to do this is to identify more exposed individuals through additional testing and provide them with Tamiflu to reduce the virus levels in their bodies.' The intensified response comes as signs suggest that the virus is spreading out of control in the US, with cases among humans and farm animals increasing rapidly. According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), 151 of the 446 confirmed dairy farm infections this year were confirmed in the last 30 days. The number of confirmed human cases rose to 46 on Thursday, up from 31 on October 24. 'In any outbreak situation, we know that there are individuals who may have been exposed, may have been infected, and are not part of the count,' Shah said. 'These data really help us understand that some of those workers may have had symptoms so mild that they don't remember being sick.' In addition to the new testing and antiviral recommendations, the CDC is also updating its equipment protection guidelines. The CDC believes that H5N1 still represents a low risk to the general public, although the number of human cases is growing. Almost all cases have been mild, with more than half occurring in workers exposed to infected cattle, and almost all others in workers exposed to infected birds. In late October, the USDA revealed that a pig on a domestic farm in Oregon tested positive for H5N1, the first known case in a pig in the US. Experts have long been concerned about the entry of H5N1 into the pig population, because bird flu viruses adapted to infect birds and humans can infect pigs and recombine in these animals to create new, more dangerous germs. This process is believed to be responsible for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The USDA reported on Wednesday that a second pig on the same farm also tested positive for H5N1. The agency said that the pigs were infected with a strain of H5N1 found in wild birds, not the strain circulating among dairy cattle, and that the animals on that farm likely became infected through migratory birds.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 12:30 PM\nSource:[ISTOÉ Independente](https://istoe.com.br/eua-intensificam-testes-em-trabalhadores-de-fazendas-leiteiras-apos-surto-de-gripe-aviaria/)\n\n**Bird flu could become deadlier if it mixes with seasonal flu viruses, experts warn**\nThe H5N1 bird flu virus has been spreading in the US, with 36 human cases reported across 17 states since April 2024. While the virus has been mostly mild, with symptoms such as eye redness and cough, experts warn that it could become deadlier if it mixes with seasonal flu viruses. Vasso Apostolopoulos, an immunologist, suggests that genetic differences in the H5N1 virus in Cambodia may account for its higher virulence. Francesco Branda, an epidemiologist, notes that the US cases involve able-bodied farm employees, making it unclear whether older adults or people with medical conditions would show mild symptoms. The CDC has not found any evidence of person-to-person spread, but experts warn that reassortment, where multiple strains of influenza infect the same person, could lead to the emergence of a new, highly virulent strain. Public health agencies are urged to increase testing of animals and humans in contact with affected animals, and broader surveillance testing across the country.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 07:47 PM\nSource:[livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/bird-flu-could-become-deadlier-if-it-mixes-with-seasonal-flu-viruses-experts-warn)\n\n**From poultry to public health: Understanding the H5N1 threat**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is monitoring the spread of avian influenza (H5N1) in the United States, particularly among poultry and dairy workers. As of October 9, 2024, 18 human cases of H5N1 have been reported in the US since 2022. The CDC has allocated over 100,000 doses of seasonal flu vaccine for farm workers in 12 states with positive H5 cases to mitigate the risk of spread. The agency is also testing existing candidate vaccines for effectiveness against current H5N1 strains. Meghan Davis, DVM, PhD, MPH, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, emphasized the importance of the One Health approach in addressing zoonotic diseases like H5N1. The CDC is working with public health laboratories to monitor influenza virus testing and flu surveillance data using CDC's enhanced nationwide summer surveillance strategy. The agency is also providing safety measures for veterinary professionals and clients, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and biosecurity protocols. According to Kemba Marshall, MPH, DVM, DABVP (Avian), SHRM-CP, founder of Marshall Recruiting Consortium, 'Biosecurity also means we should be able to have a record and a log of every person that came to the fair, animal exhibition, or farm.' The CDC recommends that feline owners who have interacted with animals or birds with unknown health status change their clothes and shoes before interacting with personal pets. The agency is also warning against consuming unpasteurized milk due to the H5N1 bird flu virus found in more than 140 US dairy herds and high levels in raw milk.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 05:49 PM\nSource:[dvm360.com](https://www.dvm360.com/view/comprehending-the-h5n1-threat-to-public-health)\n\n**From Poultry to Public Health: Understanding the H5N1 Threat**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is monitoring the spread of H5N1 avian influenza in the United States, with 18 human cases reported since 2022. The virus has primarily circulated in the Midwest, with cases raising concerns about potential human transmission and broader public health implications. Despite the rise in cases, the CDC maintains that the risk to the public remains low, although those with occupational exposure to sick animals face a higher risk. The CDC is using the One Health approach to monitor the situation, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. The agency has deployed a multilingual epidemiological field team to assist local health departments with outreach and surveillance efforts. To date, more than 5100 individuals exposed to potentially infected animals have been monitored, and more than 54,000 specimens have been tested for H5N1 viruses. The CDC has also allocated more than 100,000 doses of seasonal flu vaccine for farm workers in 12 states with positive H5 cases to mitigate the risk of spread. Additionally, the CDC is testing existing candidate vaccines for effectiveness against current H5N1 strains. Recent studies suggest that licensed adjuvanted H5N1 vaccines may generate cross-neutralizing antibodies against circulating variants, aiding in pandemic preparedness. The CDC advises that it is currently unlikely humans can become infected through an infected stray, wild, feral, or domestic cat, but human infection can be possible if there is prolonged unprotected exposure to infected animals in individuals not wearing personal protective equipment. The agency also recommends feline owners who have interacted with animals or birds with unknown health status change their clothes and shoes before interacting with personal pets. For owners of potentially infected pets, veterinarians should refer them to their state's Department of Public Health and Environment in order to monitor human exposure and potential human disease transmission. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 01:39 PM\nSource:[contagionlive.com](https://www.contagionlive.com/view/from-poultry-to-public-health-understanding-the-h5n1-threat)\n\n**Washington Reports First Human Cases of H5N1 Avian Influenza**\nThe state of Washington in the US has reported the first four human cases of H5N1 avian influenza, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) awaiting confirmation. The cases involve four agricultural workers who tested positive for the virus after working with infected poultry at a commercial egg farm in Franklin County. They have shown mild symptoms and have been treated with antiviral medication. The Department of Health in Washington has stated that this is the first suspected human case of H5 virus under investigation in the state. The cases occurred at a facility that was the site of an avian influenza outbreak in poultry. Approximately 800,000 birds were culled after test results from the Washington Department of Agriculture on October 15 revealed the infection. The investigation into the workers continues, and measures have been put in place to protect them. Washington is the sixth state to identify a human infection with H5N1. The highly pathogenic (HPAI) H5N1 virus has caused ongoing outbreaks in poultry, dairy cattle, and wildlife. 'Washington has closely monitored the spread of H5N1 since it was first detected in poultry in 2022, and our state is prepared, has the knowledge and tools to minimize its impact on our community,' said Washington Secretary of Health Umair Shah. In recent days, five other possible human cases of H5N1 avian influenza have been reported by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), in people from the Central Valley who had direct contact with infected dairy cows. Six cases have been confirmed in California, where public health authorities continue to proactively test symptomatic individuals. A biomarker for avian influenza was detected in wastewater in Texas weeks before the outbreaks in cattle were reported. This is one of the findings from a study presented at the ID Week, the annual meeting of leading scientific societies dedicated to infectious diseases in the US. Researchers from the WastewaterScan team at Stanford University used a sensor to detect virus fragments in wastewater treatment plants across the US. The surveillance implemented retrospectively to investigate an unusually high level of influenza A in Texas at the beginning of 2024 was able to detect the virus two weeks before the cases in dairy cows were reported and a month before the virus was confirmed. 'Every second counts when responding to emerging pathogens,' emphasized Alessandro Zulli, postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University, in the IDWeek press release. 'The widespread use of wastewater surveillance will provide public health professionals with the early warning system they need to tackle these infectious threats.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 09:08 AM\nSource:[quotidianodibari.it](https://quotidianodibari.it/aviaria-nuovi-casi-umani-negli-usa-colpito-anche-stato-washington/)\n\n**H5N1 Bird Flu: What You Need to Know**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 27 human cases of avian influenza A(H5) in the US from March to October 2024. The cases include 17 dairy cattle workers, 9 poultry workers, and 1 person without occupational exposure. All patients received oseltamivir treatment and recovered. The CDC has confirmed that dairy cow-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has occurred in the US for the first time. The virus has been detected in dairy cows in Texas, Michigan, Colorado, and California. The CDC has also reported cases of avian influenza A(H5) in poultry workers in Colorado, with 9 cases identified. The virus was associated with exposure to A(H5N1) virus during outbreaks among chickens at two commercial egg-laying facilities in Colorado. The CDC has confirmed a case in Missouri who was hospitalized with atypical symptoms. The source of the virus is unknown, and no secondary transmission to close contacts was identified. The CDC has recommended that any detection of influenza A virus in a respiratory specimen from a human patient across any healthcare setting in the US be subtyped. This includes testing for A(H5) virus. The CDC has also recommended that people who work with infected animals, such as poultry and dairy cows, utilize recommended PPE, including an N95 respirator, eye protection, a protective gown, and gloves. 'We're not seeing severe disease and there were no hospitalizations required,' said Cara Drehoff, Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer at the CDC. 'We didn't see any evidence of human-to-human transmission, and all of the workers who tested positive had been handling sick or dead birds.' The CDC has also emphasized the importance of ongoing surveillance of A(H5N1) viruses in wild birds, poultry, farmed and wild mammals, dairy cows, and any other infected animals to monitor the public health threat. 'Because A(H5N1) viruses, like all influenza A viruses, are dynamic and continually evolving, ongoing surveillance of these viruses is critical to monitoring the public health threat,' said Tim Uyeki, Chief Medical Officer for the Influenza Division at the CDC. 'We will continue to work closely with our local and state health partners on enhanced surveillance for influenza A viruses and novel influenza A viruses.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2024 08:33 PM\nSource:[Medscape](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/h5n1-bird-flu-what-you-need-know-2024a1000ix2)\n\n**Washington reports four presumptive H5N1 cases in humans**\nThe Washington State Department of Health (DOH) announced four commercial egg farm workers tested presumptively positive for avian influenza (H5N1) on October 20.

This is due to the 'lake effect', a meteorological phenomenon that occurs when cold air passes over large bodies of warmer water, such as the Great Lakes. Cities like Marquette, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, often record high levels of snow accumulation each winter, with averages of over 300 inches (7.6 meters). The 'lake effect' causes the warm and humid air over the water to rise rapidly, cool and condense, forming clouds that produce intense snowfall as they move towards land. According to a report by the University of Michigan, this phenomenon can produce very localized but intense snowfall, more common in autumn and winter when lake temperatures have not dropped drastically. Areas affected by the 'lake effect' can receive snow accumulations of several feet in a few days, making cities near the Great Lakes some of the snowiest in the US, after Alaska. However, a recent study by Wisevoter found that New Hampshire had the highest average annual snowfall, followed by Maine and Vermont, which surpassed Alaska in 2023. The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that the 2023-2024 winter was 'much warmer than normal', with December and February being warmer than average, and January being colder. Snowfall was also below normal, with most areas receiving 0.5 to 3 inches, except for a corridor in southern Illinois, which received 4 to 7 inches due to a strong storm on February 16, 2024.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 23, 2024 03:35 AM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/cual-es-el-estado-norteamericano-en-el-que-cae-mas-nieve-en-invierno-despues-de-alaska-segun-chatgpt-nid23112024/)\n\n**NOAA releases new outlook for winter 2024-25.

However, temperatures are more difficult to predict, with an equal chance of being above or below average. Historically, La Niña winters have been mixed, with five colder-than-normal, six warmer-than-normal, and three near-normal winters in Chicago since 1996. The average snowfall is 38.4 inches, but Chicago only had around 20 inches in the past two years, making it likely that this winter will be wetter than average but not as mild as the past few winters.

The week of Thanksgiving will bring a 'return to colder conditions' after milder weather in the low 50s on Sunday. A cold front is expected to come through the Chicago area on Monday, bringing a chilly air mass into the region. After the holiday weekend, Castro said that a 'pretty cold start to December' appears likely, with even colder air coming into the region. This could bring 'occasional chances for accumulating snow,' with Thursday's snowfall being the season's first 'wake-up call that we're in Northern Illinois.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 22, 2024 04:51 PM\nSource:[Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/11/22/chicago-thanksgiving-weather-forecast-in-chicago/)\n\n**Strong Storm System to Bring Intense Snowfall to Western US and Chicago**\nA strong storm system is expected to bring intense snowfall to Oregon, California, and Chicago, Illinois, in the coming days.

Although significant accumulations are not expected, the event marks the beginning of a winter season that typically starts in Chicago around late October. Historically, the latest first snowfall in Chicago occurred on December 5, 1999, making this week's event one of the latest starts in recent decades. The weather forecast also suggests another storm system could hit the western United States by the end of next week, with additional snowfall accumulations estimated between 25 and 50 centimeters in some ski resorts.

Typically, the city sees its first snowfall before November, but this year's warm temperatures have pushed back the event. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the city has not yet experienced its first measurable snowfall this year, and the warm weather may continue to delay the event. The NWS predicts a 70-80% chance of above-average temperatures in Illinois, including Chicago, from November 14-22, which reduces the likelihood of snow in the next few weeks. The last time Chicago took this long to register its first snowfall was in 1999, when the first snowfall occurred on December 5. The city's last significant snowfall was on December 28, 2021, three days after Christmas. The warm temperatures for November are also unusual, with highs expected to reach 16°C (61°F) in some areas, which is uncommon for this time of year. While this warm trend may reduce the chances of snow, it does not rule it out. An increase in precipitation is projected for late November, which could bring a rapid drop in temperatures and the first snowfall. However, the type of precipitation will depend on how temperatures fluctuate in the coming weeks. The NWS indicates that Chicago has a higher probability of experiencing rain than snow in the short term.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 02:13 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/illinois/se-demora-la-primera-nevada-en-chicago-y-este-es-el-nuevo-pronostico-para-su-llegada-nid11112024/)\n\n**Anchorage Weather Forecast for November 9th**\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) has released the weather forecast for Anchorage on November 9th.

The company predicts that the Chicago area could see significant snowfall, exceeding the amounts recorded in the past season. However, this winter may also bring warmer temperatures than usual, with lower heating demands in the northern part of the state. The snowfall accumulations, ranging from 76 to 114 cm, would surpass the 56.3 cm that fell in the 2023-2024 winter. Paul Pastelok, AccuWeather meteorologist, noted that the La Niña phenomenon, although present, will be weak, allowing other factors to influence the climate pattern, resulting in more variability during the winter. A polar vortex could bring cold air in February, but it's uncertain if it will reach the continental United States. The forecast also indicates that several cities in the northeastern and midwestern United States, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, will see more snow than last winter, potentially reaching near-historical averages. Additionally, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan may experience a significant increase in snowfall. The climate variability in the 2024-2025 season is expected to bring periods of snow and intense cold, but also warmer air from the Pacific in early 2025, which could reduce snowfall and alter the climate in some areas. Pastelok warned about the risk of severe storms during the winter, which could affect states further north, such as Missouri, Arkansas, and Tennessee, while the risk of severe storms would increase along the Gulf of Mexico coast in February.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 27, 2024 11:39 AM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/illinois/cuanta-nieve-puede-esperarse-en-illinois-este-invierno-nid27102024/)\n\n**A La Niña winter is expected, scientists say.

Latest winter weather predictions**\nAccording to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) latest winter weather outlook for 2024-25, a 'La Niña' winter is expected, which would result in a 'wetter than normal' winter in the Great Lakes, especially in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. Kevin Jeanes, a meteorologist, said that this would be beneficial as the region has been experiencing a moderate drought. The winter precipitation outlook for the Chicago area is expected to be above average, with 18.5 inches of snow recorded during the 2023-24 meteorological winter, 11.1 inches below normal. However, the big question is whether temperatures will cause precipitation to fall in the form of rain or snow. Jeanes noted that it could be colder than last year, but only compared to the extremely warm temperatures recorded in 2023-24. NOAA predicts 'equal chances' of temperatures being above or below average. A much colder winter is expected across the Northwest, while a La Niña event typically leads to cooler springs if the pattern persists.

While immediate forecasts do not predict snow, the city is preparing for the first signs of winter. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the first light snows typically occur by the end of October, marking the beginning of winter. Estimated snowfall dates are as follows: light snows (less than 2.54 cm) are expected on average by October 31, significant snowfall (2.54 cm or more) is expected to occur from November 18, and snowfall of one inch or more is expected on December 7. However, it is possible that snow could occur earlier. This winter may be influenced by La Niña, a weather pattern that could lead to a 'wetter-than-normal' winter, especially in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the La Niña event is expected to strengthen during the winter months. This forecast also predicts that more storm systems will hit the Chicago area, with a 50/50 chance of precipitation being rain or snow. However, the University of Illinois notes that stronger La Niña patterns can produce winters that are 'warmer and wetter than average', with more snow and winter storms during those seasons.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 02:59 PM\nSource:[2001online.com](https://2001online.com/usa/servicios/illinois-sepa-para-cuando-se-estima-que-empezara-a-nevar-en-chicago-2024102310240)\n\n**How will winter be in Illinois: the amount of snow that will fall in the prairie state**\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its winter climate forecast for 2024-25. The winter season in Illinois is expected to be influenced by the 'La Niña' climate phenomenon, which is characterized by the cooling of Pacific Ocean waters. This may lead to some unexpected weather patterns in the state. The NOAA indicates that the 'La Niña' pattern is expected to strengthen during the winter season, which runs from December 1 to February 28, and may direct the prevailing jet stream more to the north, leading to more storm systems hitting the Chicago area. According to AccuWeather, Chicago is expected to receive between 76 and 114 cm of snow this winter, which is significantly more than the 56.4 cm received in 2023 and even exceeds the average of the past decade, which was 97.5 cm. AccuWeather's meteorologist, Paul Pastelok, notes that a less intense 'La Niña' allows other climate variables to take center stage, which could result in a more variable winter. In Chicago, this could mean warmer-than-usual temperatures and less heating demand in the northern half of the state. Although there is a possibility of a polar vortex in February, the certainty of its arrival is low. This could influence the appearance of intense cold air in the United States. The University of Illinois notes that stronger 'La Niña' patterns tend to produce winters that are 'warmer and wetter than average,' with more snow and winter storms during those seasons.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 21, 2024 05:58 AM\nSource:[El Comercio Perú](https://elcomercio.pe/mag/respuestas/us/como-sera-el-invierno-en-illinois-la-cantidad-de-nieve-que-caera-en-el-estado-de-la-pradera-estados-unidos-nnda-nnlt-noticia/)\n\n**Saudi Arabia to Experience Winter Seasonally in December**\nAccording to meteorologist Akil Al-Akail, the winter season will officially begin on December 1, while the astronomical winter will start on December 22.

According to NOAA officials, a 'slow-developing' La Niña event in the Pacific Ocean will likely strengthen the dominant weather pattern in the Great Lakes, resulting in a 'wetter-than-normal' winter, especially in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. The La Niña pattern is expected to intensify during the meteorological winter, which runs from December 1 to February 28, and will likely direct the prevailing jet stream more to the north, causing more storm systems to hit the Chicago area. The question remains whether temperatures will cause precipitation to fall as rain or snow. At this point, NOAA says there is 'equal probability' of temperatures above or below average, which could have a significant impact on whether it rains or snows in the region. According to NOAA, they have implemented several improvements to their forecasting tools, including an experimental model called the 'Winter Storm Severity Probability Index'. These data were used to help with this year's projections after it was first implemented at the end of 2023, according to officials. According to the University of Illinois, the strongest La Niña patterns can produce winters that are 'warmer and wetter than average', with more snow and winter storms during those seasons. A La Niña event also tends to cause colder springs if the pattern persists. In a La Niña event, the trade winds are stronger than usual and push warm water away from the Americas and towards Asia, allowing a process known as 'upwelling' to occur, which brings cold water to the ocean's surface. These cold waters cause polar jet streams to form more to the north, leading to droughts in the southern United States and more precipitation in the Midwest and the northwest Pacific.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 17, 2024 06:13 PM\nSource:[telemundochicago.com](https://www.telemundochicago.com/noticias/local/noaa-publica-sus-proyecciones-del-tiempo-inviernal-para-el-area-de-chicago/2499000/)\n\n**Temperatures falling — will the snow follow?**\nTemperatures in Anchorage, Alaska are falling, but it's unclear if snow will follow.

The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued a warning for a cold front that is expected to bring rain, strong winds, and a significant drop in temperature, with lows potentially reaching the mid-50s (around 10°C) over the weekend. According to the NWS, 'Before the cooler temperatures we've been expecting, a cold front will pass today and bring scattered rain and isolated thunderstorms. Thursday and later, the weather will be dry and temperatures will drop to between 45 and 50 degrees on Friday and Saturday.' The NWS predicts that if this forecast comes to pass, residents of Miami and southern Florida will experience the coldest morning of the year since February, the peak of winter in the US. 'The coolest weather the southern Florida region has experienced since last winter will arrive by the end of this week and during the weekend. The greatest chances of temperatures falling below 50 degrees will occur in the interior of southern Florida on Friday morning,' insists the NWS forecast for the next few days.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 08:45 PM\nSource:[Mundo Deportivo](https://www.mundodeportivo.com/us/actualidad/20241120/708587/llega-frio-miami-nws-anticipa-dia-mas-fresco-temporada-esta-cerca.html)\n\n**For some, this Florida 'snow' is worth bragging about.

According to Robert Molleda, chief meteorologist for the National Weather Service's Miami office, 'So warmer and drier from now all the way through April. In fact, the models are indicating that it's possible that the February to April period could tilt a little drier.' La Niñas typically push the jet stream further north, resulting in less stormy weather. The region is in good shape for water supply, but water managers are keeping an eye on Lake Okeechobee, the primary dry season source for freshwater. The Army Corps will allow the lake to recede to help it recover from high wet season levels, said Maj. Cory Bell, district deputy commander for the Corps' Jacksonville District. 'As we move forward in the dry season, we're looking at lake recovery operations, and we will communicate that with our stakeholders,' he said. With a rainy season delivering about 120% of normal rainfall, water restrictions look unlikely, according to South Florida Water Management District officials.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 02:57 PM\nSource:[wlrn.org](https://www.wlrn.org/environment/2024-11-19/south-florida-winter-weather)\n\n**South Florida welcomes refreshing chill in the air**\nSouth Florida is experiencing a refreshing change in the weather, with cooler temperatures and a touch of autumn in the air.

The CPC also predicts that the phenomenon of 'nina' will continue until March 2025, making it more likely for the world to experience colder temperatures than usual. The CPC notes that the shift from the 'nino' phenomenon to the 'nina' phenomenon will bring changes to the global climate, with some regions experiencing more variability than others. In the United States, 17 states have been issued winter weather warnings, with parts of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, and South Dakota expected to experience cold temperatures. Heavy snowfall is expected in the Oregon Cascades, with up to 2 feet of snow, and 15-18 inches of snow in the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming and the Colorado Mountains.

The 2023 year was already a record year, and the combined effect of a rapid transition from La Nina to El Nino, along with the long-term warming trend, likely contributed to the significant temperature increase. With two months left in 2024, which was influenced by the now-ended El Nino phenomenon, the current cooling trend is unlikely to prevent 2024 from becoming the new record year. To avoid breaking the 2023 record, the temperature anomalies for November and December 2024 would need to be unusually low, at -0.25°C, which is highly unlikely given the previous anomalies. In fact, the anomalies for the two months would need to decrease by 0.5°C compared to the first 10 months to not exceed the 2023 average. Therefore, it can be said that 2024 is virtually certain to be the new record year, just one year after the previous one.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 10, 2024 11:55 AM\nSource:[3BMeteo | Previsioni Meteo](https://www.3bmeteo.com/giornale-meteo/clima--il-2024--perch-egrave---egrave--molto-probabile-possa-essere-un-anno-record-a-livello-globale-731551)\n\n**2024 will be the hottest on record and the first to exceed 1.5°C of the pre-industrial average**\nAccording to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), 2024 is set to be the hottest year on record, surpassing 2023, and the first year to exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This is based on a preliminary analysis of global temperatures in October, which showed a 1.65°C increase above pre-industrial levels. Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of C3S, stated that 'it is now virtually certain that 2024 will be the hottest year on record and the first year with more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.' The ERA5 dataset indicates that 2024 will likely exceed 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels. Climate change is already resulting in intense droughts and floods, with above-average precipitation conditions observed in several regions, including the Iberian Peninsula, France, and Norway. The Arctic sea ice recorded its fourth lowest average extent in October, and sea ice extent in Antarctica was the second lowest on record. The mean sea surface temperature (SST) for October 2024 was 20.68°C, the second highest value recorded for the month.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 06:00 PM\nSource:[yourweather.co.uk](https://www.yourweather.co.uk/news/trending/2024-will-be-the-hottest-on-record-and-the-first-to-exceed-1-5-c-of-the-pre-industrial-average.html)\n\n**Tampa and Earth Break All-Time Heat Records**\nThe year 2024 has been extremely hot in the Tampa Bay area and around the world. According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service of the ECMWF, it is almost certain that 2024 will be the hottest year on record globally. The Tampa airport reached a record high temperature of 91°F and a record heat index of 101°F on Wednesday, adding to the summer's record heat. This brings the total number of days in Tampa with a heat index of at least 100°F to 100, breaking the previous record of 88 set in 2023 and 2022. While 2024 may not be the hottest year on record for the Tampa Bay area, it will likely be among the top five hottest years for many neighborhoods. However, globally, 2024 will be the hottest year on record since temperature records began in the 1940s. The average global temperature for the month of October 2024 was 1.65°C above pre-industrial levels, and this is the 15th month in a row where the global average surface air temperature has exceeded 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This is a critical threshold, as the Paris Climate Agreement aims to keep global temperatures below this level to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. While the planet has exceeded this threshold, it does not necessarily mean that we have failed... yet. There is a possibility that global temperatures could drop below +1.5°C next year, as a La Niña event is forming in the Pacific. However, in the long term, exceeding this threshold seems inevitable, as we continue to emit greenhouse gases that trap heat from fossil fuel burning. Due to human activities, it is likely that the Earth has not experienced global temperatures this high in over 120,000 years. These higher temperatures bring additional energy and moisture, leading to more intense storms, larger floods, and more severe heatwaves. The only way to stop the warming and return temperatures to pre-industrial levels is to reduce our use of fossil fuels.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 11:07 PM\nSource:[wfla.com](https://www.wfla.com/tampa-hoy/el-tiempo/historias-del-tiempo/tampa-y-la-tierra-rompen-records-de-calor-de-todos-los-tiempos/)\n\n**Tampa and Earth shattering all-time heat records**\nTampa, Florida, has broken its all-time heat record with a daily high of 91°F and an all-time November record high heat index of 101°F.

According to ECMWF Copernicus Climate Change Service, 2024 is virtually certain to be the hottest year on record for Earth, with a global average surface air temperature of 1.65°C above the pre-industrial level in October 2024. This marks the 15th month in a 16-month period where the global average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Jeff Berardelli, WFLA's Chief Meteorologist and Climate Specialist, notes that while the planet has technically not failed to meet the 1.5C threshold, breaching it now seems inevitable due to continued greenhouse gas emissions. Berardelli emphasizes that the only way to stop the warming and bring temperatures back down to pre-industrial levels is to slow our use of fossil fuels.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 09:58 PM\nSource:[wfla.com](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tampa-and-earth-shattering-all-time-heat-records/)\n\n**2024 Set to Be Hottest Year Ever Recorded, C3S Data Shows**\nThe Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) has released new data showing a new record of the ongoing climate crisis. According to Samantha Burgess, C3S deputy director, 'After 10 months, it is now almost certain that 2024 will be the hottest year ever recorded and the first to exceed the 1.5°C threshold above pre-industrial levels according to ERA5 data. This record should be a catalyst to intensify efforts in view of the next COP29.' October 2024 was the second hottest October ever recorded, with a global average temperature of 15.25°C, 0.80°C above the 1991-2020 average. This October was 1.65°C above pre-industrial levels (1850-1900) and was the 15th month in a 16-month period where the global average temperature has exceeded 1.5°C. The global average temperature for the past 12 months (November 2023 - October 2024) was 0.74°C above the 1991-2020 average and 1.62°C above the pre-industrial average of 1850-1900. The global temperature anomaly for the first 10 months of 2024 was 0.71°C above the 1991-2020 average, a record value. According to C3S scientists, it is now certain that 2024 will be the hottest year ever recorded. To avoid this, the temperature anomaly would need to drop drastically to almost zero in the next two months. The 2023 anomaly was 1.48°C above pre-industrial levels, and predictions for 2024 indicate that this value will rise above 1.5°C, likely reaching 1.55°C. In Europe, October 2024 was the fifth hottest October ever recorded, with a temperature anomaly of 1.23°C above the 1991-2020 average. The record remains the October 2022, with an anomaly of 1.92°C. The most marked anomalies were recorded in northern Canada, central and western United States, Tibet, Japan, and Australia. The only regions with temperatures below average were central Greenland and Iceland. The sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly was 0.80°C above the 1991-2020 average, the second highest value ever recorded in October. Despite the passage through La Niña conditions in the Pacific equatorial eastern and central regions, SSTs remained unusually high in many areas. The Arctic sea ice extent was the fourth lowest ever recorded for October, 19% below average. The concentration of sea ice was particularly low in all marginal areas of the Arctic Ocean, with significant anomalies in the Barents Sea, Canadian Archipelago, and north of the Svalbard Islands. The Antarctic sea ice extent was also at record lows, 8% below average, the second lowest value ever recorded for October, surpassed only by October 2023 (-11%). This confirms the persistence of strong negative anomalies that have characterized both 2023 and 2024. In the Antarctic Ocean, sea ice concentrations remained very low, especially in the Indian Ocean area. The hydrological variables showed that the Iberian Peninsula, France, northern Italy, Norway, northern Sweden, and the eastern part of the Black Sea had above-average precipitation. In contrast, many areas of eastern Europe, such as western Russia, Greece, and western Turkey, had below-average precipitation and soil moisture. Unusually wet conditions were also observed in southern China and eastern China, Taiwan, Florida, some areas of western Australia, and southern Brazil. In Florida, Hurricane Milton struck the coast less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene. On the other hand, drier-than-usual conditions were observed in most of the United States, the central Australian plains, many areas of southern Africa and Madagascar, as well as parts of Argentina and Chile, where the persistent drought in the United States is affecting a record number of people.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 12:47 PM\nSource:[ecodallecitta.it](https://www.ecodallecitta.it/cambiamento-climatico-il-2024-sara-sicuramente-il-primo-anno-sopra-15-c-e-il-piu-caldo-di-sempre/)\n\n**2024 Set to be Hottest Year on Record, Global Temperature to Exceed 1.5°C Threshold**\nAccording to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, 2024 will be the hottest year on record, with the second warmest October globally, after 2023.

The country's telecom regulator has called for a temporary ban on TikTok until an investigation into allegations of election interference is completed. According to Reuters, Georgescu, 62, was polling in single digits before the vote, but surged into the runoff after the vote, and will face centrist candidate Elena Lasconi in the second round on December 8. Georgescu's campaign heavily relied on TikTok, a video-sharing platform, to reach young people and overseas Romanian expats. Pavel Popescu, deputy head of Romania's telecom regulator, said, 'I urge the temporary suspension of TikTok in Romania from November 28 until the completion of the investigation into the manipulation of the electoral process.' The National Audiovisual Council of Romania has already asked the European Commission to investigate TikTok's role in the election, citing allegations of 'manipulating public opinion.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 27, 2024 08:16 PM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/202411280008.aspx)\n\n**There’s a simple explanation for Calin Georgescu’s ‘shock’ triumph in Romania**\nCalin Georgescu, a 'far-right, pro-Russian candidate', has taken a surprise lead in Romania's presidential election. Georgescu, who won almost 23% of the vote, tapped into the concerns of ordinary Romanians, particularly elderly people, who are struggling with high inflation and economic hardships. He made a link between the war in Ukraine and Romania's economic struggles, and promised to reduce imports and give more support to agriculture. Georgescu's campaign was focused on Romania's interests, rather than loyalty to supra-national organizations like the EU and Nato. His success has been met with shock and horror from western liberal-elite circles, but it is understandable given the disconnect between the concerns of ordinary Romanians and the policies of the incumbent parties. Georgescu's message of social conservatism, patriotism, and economic populism has resonated with voters, and he is likely to do well in the second round of voting on December 8.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 27, 2024 09:25 AM\nSource:[spectator.co.uk](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/theres-a-simple-explanation-for-calin-georgescus-shock-triumph-in-romania/)\n\n**Protesters hold rally against far-right independent candidate Georgescu in Romania**\nAround one thousand students and activists gathered at University Square in central Bucharest to protest against pro-Russian independent candidate Calin Georgescu, who led in the first round of the presidential race with 22.94 percent of the total number of votes. The protesters are concerned about Georgescu's views, which they see as a threat to Romania's democracy. The second round of the presidential election will be held on December 8, 2024. According to the protesters, Georgescu's victory would be a 'disaster' for the country. 'We cannot let a pro-Russian candidate win the presidency,' said one of the protesters. 'It would be a disaster for Romania's democracy and sovereignty.' The protesters are calling for Georgescu to be disqualified from the election. 'We demand that the electoral authorities take action against Georgescu and ensure that the election is fair and transparent,' said another protester. The protesters' message is clear: they will not let Georgescu win without a fight.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 27, 2024 02:54 AM\nSource:[efeservicios.com](https://efs.efeservicios.com/en/video/protesters-hold-rally-farright-independent-candidate-georgescu-romania/55015349201)\n\n**Călin Georgescu Wins First Round of Romanian Presidential Election**\n62-year-old independent candidate Călin Georgescu, who advocates for strengthening ties with Russia, won the first round of the presidential election in Romania with 22.1% of the votes, according to the Central Election Commission of Romania.

'We will follow the election process in Romania,' said Dmitry Peskov, a spokesperson for the Kremlin, but added that the Russian authorities are not familiar with Georgescu's plans regarding relations with Russia.

Lasconi will face Georgescu in the second round on December 8. Georgescu's victory was a surprise, as he was initially expected to receive around 5% of the votes. He won over voters with his loud and emotive campaign, which included viral TikTok videos. Georgescu said, 'This night, the Romanian people shouted for peace, and they shouted very loudly, extremely loudly.'

Current Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, who is a member of the Social Democratic Party, presented his resignation as party leader after the poor results. Georgescu, who has 3.4 million followers on TikTok, announced that he has 'lit the candle of hope and courage to be Romanian. The Romanian people have chosen to stop kneeling, not to be humiliated.' He also stated that 'the Romanian people shouted 'peace' tonight, and they did it very loudly.' Georgescu will face Lasconi in the second round on December 8. Lasconi, a former journalist and mayor of Campulung, has a strong nationalist, liberal, pro-European, and pro-NATO message. Ciolacu, on the other hand, will not participate in the second round, saying that 'the rules of democracy and the importance of this second round are much greater than our personal interests.' Georgescu's victory comes at a time when there is a growing fear of rupture in NATO and the European Union following Donald Trump's victory in the US. He has previously stated that Ukraine is 'a country invented' and that Vladimir Putin is 'a man who loves his country' and 'someone who understands very well the diplomatic angles, dominates them, and is surrounded by highly qualified professionals.' He also advocates for Romania's withdrawal from NATO, believing that the Alliance would not defend it in case of an invasion. Additionally, Georgescu is an open defender of known Nazi collaborators from World War II, including Ion Antonescu and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, whom he considers 'national heroes.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 26, 2024 04:13 AM\nSource:[La Voz de Galicia](https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/internacional/2024/11/26/prorruso-georgescu-da-sorpresa-gana-primera-vuelta-presidenciales-rumanas/0003_202411G26P20991.htm)\n\n**Right-Wing Candidate Advances to Second Round in Romanian Presidential Election**\nIn a surprise turn of events, independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu will face off against center-right opposition leader Elena Lasconi in the second round of Romania's presidential election.

Georgescu, who has 200,000 followers on TikTok, has been a vocal critic of the European Union and NATO, and has expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin. He has challenged the traditional Romanian politicians and left the country, which shares a 650-kilometer border with Ukraine, with an uncertain political landscape. Georgescu's campaign has been focused on digital platforms, using viral videos, podcasts, and influencers to capture votes, particularly among young people. He has proposed reducing dependence on imports, supporting farmers, increasing domestic food and energy production, and offering tax benefits to Romanian producers. Georgescu's strategy has left analysts debating whether his surprise success is due to voter discontent with high inflation, disinformation, or even possible Russian interference, given his known support for Putin and his open criticism of NATO and the EU. Georgescu said in a press conference on election night, 'The Romanian people have awakened and refuse to be on their knees, invaded and humiliated.' He linked economic discontent to his success and, in a veiled message towards the war in Ukraine, said, 'The Romanian people have shouted 'peace' tonight.' His mystical rhetoric, in which he describes himself as a 'sent' by God, has generated shock. Cristian Tudor Popescu, a renowned Romanian journalist, said, 'On the night of November 24, 2024, the Russian invasion of Romania began.'

He is also critical of Romania's membership in the EU and NATO, claiming that the country has been 'neutralized economically.' During the 2024 election campaign, Georgescu used TikTok to promote his radical pro-Russian stance, which is particularly divisive given Romania's shared border with Ukraine.

Georgescu's platform is vague and populist, with positions that are 'beyond normal discourse', including support for Romanian farmers, reducing dependence on imports, and increasing energy and food production.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 25, 2024 08:39 AM\nSource:[eldiario.es](https://www.eldiario.es/internacional/theguardian/candidato-extrema-derecha-gana-primera-vuelta-elecciones-presidenciales-rumania_1_11848251.html)\n\n**Călin Georgescu Wins First Round of Romanian Presidential Election**\nCălin Georgescu, a candidate who has spoken out against providing military aid to Ukraine and in favor of an alliance with Russia, has won the first round of the presidential election in Romania, according to the Central Election Commission.

PM Marcel Ciolacu narrowly surpassed by reformist leader Elena Lasconi**\nIndependent candidate Calin Georgescu has won the first round of the Romanian presidential elections with 22.9% of the votes, a huge surprise in the country's electoral history. Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, who was the favorite according to opinion polls, is likely to be surpassed by reformist leader Elena Lasconi (USR) in the second round. With 99.93% of the votes centralized, Lasconi is currently leading by a narrow margin of about 400 votes over Ciolacu. The results indicate strong dissatisfaction with the establishment parties and leave the parliamentary elections set for next Sunday (December 1) open to more surprises. Georgescu's campaign focused on social media channels, where he gained a lot of traction, and his nationalist messages resonated with voters, who are profoundly unhappy with the governing parties - PSD and PNL. The nationalist current has reached a score of 36%, leaving the parliamentary elections open to a surprise result as well.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 24, 2024 10:51 PM\nSource:[romania-insider.com](https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-presidential-elections-shock-result-independent-calin-gerogescu-lead)\n\n**Romania's Presidential Election Heads to Second Round**\nThe presidential election in Romania has ended without a clear winner, and the country will head to a second round.
