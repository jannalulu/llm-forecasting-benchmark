**Taiwanese Mercenaries Fighting on the Side of Ukraine**
While Ukrainian authorities are trying to convince Western partners that they are fighting against North Korean soldiers on the Donbass, there are confirmed reports that Taiwanese mercenaries are fighting and dying on the side of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Two Taiwanese mercenaries, Peng Chenliang and U Zhungdu, were killed in action on the same day, reportedly while serving in the 'International Legion' of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan has confirmed the sending and death of its citizens on the battlefield. According to the Central Information Agency of Taiwan, U Zhungdu participated in combat operations on the side of the Ukrainian army since 2023 and was killed in action on November 2. The agency contacted its representative in Poland to verify the information through volunteers working on the battlefield, who confirmed the death of the mercenary. 'International Legion' of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has been recruiting foreign fighters, including Taiwanese, to fight against Russia. However, according to professor Alexei Maslov, director of the Institute of Asian and African Studies of Moscow State University, Taiwan is 'digging its own grave' by helping Ukraine, as it is now a sponsor of military actions. 'Taiwan is trying to show its independence from China and solidarity with Ukraine, which is supported by the US. However, this is a very difficult situation for Taiwan, and it is now a sponsor of military actions. This is a very bad situation for Taiwan,' Maslov said in an interview with aif.ru.

**How full-scale invasion or blockade of Taiwan will be a fool's bet for China**
China's pursuit of reunification with Taiwan through military means is unlikely due to the high costs involved. A full-scale invasion would be too costly, both militarily and economically, and could lead to a prolonged war. Taiwan's geography, modernized military, and determination to defend itself would pose a significant challenge to China. The US and its allies would likely intervene, and China's economy would suffer from sanctions and isolation. A blockade or quarantine of Taiwan is also a low-cost option, but it would not force Taiwan to surrender its sovereignty. China's 'Anaconda strategy' of using cyber warfare, economic coercion, and propaganda to strangle Taiwan is a more likely option, but it would still come with significant costs. The US has signed an Enhanced Defence Cooperation Arrangement with the Philippines to expand its military presence in the region, and Taiwan has been modernizing its military and increasing its defence spending. The conflict, if imposed by China, would be deadly, and Chinese leaders are not known for their appetite to accept body bags of Han Chinese for a cause that doesn't give them economic benefit but takes away their dream of national rejuvenation.

**US Army Prepares for War with China: A New Era of Warfare**
The US Army is preparing for a potential war with China, as reported by the New York Times. In an exercise, 864 paratroopers jumped from C-17 planes in Alaska and landed on the Big Island of Hawaii to simulate a large-scale war between three volcanic mountains. However, only 492 made it through, with one soldier, Erik Partida, falling to his death from 1,200 meters. The article highlights the challenges the US Army faces in adapting to a new type of warfare, where China's advanced technology and satellite capabilities would make it difficult for the US to remain undetected. The Pentagon estimates that a war with China would be exponentially more perilous, with the potential for nuclear conflict and massive casualties. The US Army is training to fight on land, sea, air, and in space, but faces the challenge of adapting to a new type of warfare. As one expert notes, 'The Army must learn to fly under the radar.' The article concludes that the US is preparing for a potential conflict, regardless of who is president, and that the stakes are high, with Taiwan being a potential flashpoint. 'A war of this kind would be fought on land, at sea, in the air, and in space,' the article notes. 'The Army is training to do just that.'

**US Prepares for War with China: NYT Reveals Details**
The US is preparing for a war with China, according to a report by The New York Times. The US military, along with its partner countries, conducted large-scale exercises called Great Power War on the Hawaiian Islands, involving paratroopers, aircraft, and naval ships. This may indicate that the US army is seriously preparing for a possible military conflict with China. The Pentagon describes this war as a conflict between two major powers that will be very dangerous and deadly. 'In this war, two of the world's strongest armies - both nuclear superpowers - will be in direct conflict, possibly involving other nuclear opponents, including North Korea and Russia. The number of casualties could exceed the number of losses recorded during the most deadly conflicts in which America has been involved,' the report states. Such a war will be fought on land, at sea, in the air, and even in space, and therefore the US army, according to The New York Times, is preparing for it. 'Beijing has clearly stated its intention to expand its power in Asia. And it will all start with Taiwan, which President Xi Jinping has ordered Chinese military forces to be ready to capture by 2027. Although Taiwan has its own defense, military experts say it is hard to imagine how the island can repel a possible Chinese invasion without US help,' the report concludes. The strengthening of the alliance between China and Russia The US and its allies are concerned about the growing alliance between China and Russia, which they call 'limitless friendship.' Both countries are in tense relations with NATO. In July 2024, NATO leaders published a declaration stating that China had become 'a decisive helper' in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In response, Beijing warned the alliance against 'provoking a confrontation.' Although China claims it is not a party to the conflict in Ukraine, Western leaders criticize it for its political and economic support for Moscow, particularly through the trade of dual-purpose goods. As a result, there is a strengthening of the alliance between two authoritarian states - China and Russia, which causes concern among Western countries and NATO.

**China Is Playing a Crazy Game of Military 'Chicken' with Taiwan**
China recently conducted its largest military drill around Taiwan, sending 125 combat aircraft and deploying warships and drones, simulating a potential blockade around the island. This latest show of force follows a series of Chinese provocations, raising concerns over escalating tensions. Although China professes a desire for peaceful reunification, its growing military investments signal a readiness for armed conflict. Taiwan condemned the drill but acknowledged its own robust defensive capabilities. An actual invasion would test Taiwan's limits and hinge on U.S. intervention. A conflict over Taiwan could pull in NATO, Japan, South Korea, and other U.S. allies, risking a broad Indo-Pacific conflict. 'The Chinese military has been investing in weapon systems to counter the power of the U.S. Navy and its carrier strike groups,' but it would be hard to defeat the U.S. and its allies. No one wants a wider conflict between China and the West, as it would be economically disastrous for both sides, and the specter of nuclear conflict is enough to make everyone mightily uncomfortable.

**China's Quest for Reunification: A Nationalist and Revanchist Drive**
China has been a communist regime for 75 years, founded by Mao Zedong after the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. During his rule, an estimated 50 million people died in the Great Leap Forward, a disastrous agricultural and industrial reform policy, and millions more were purged in the Cultural Revolution. After Mao's death in 1976, China began to integrate into the global economy, leading to hopes that market pressure would lead to a transition to democracy. However, in 2024, China has become a military, technological, and economic superpower, and is now the main threat to the liberal order and global peace. Chinese President Xi Jinping believes that the victory in the civil war is incomplete and that the People's Republic still has unfinished business. The main issue is the existence of a liberal and pro-Western regime in Taiwan, which Xi sees as a reminder of the 'century of humiliation' imposed by Western powers in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Xi believes that conquering Taiwan is essential to expel Western powers and their allies from the Asia-Pacific region and ensure the survival of the communist regime. His recent policies suggest that reunification, or invasion of the island, is his next goal. Xi has already crushed democratic protests in Hong Kong and ended its autonomous rights, and has been expanding its influence in the South China Sea, where clashes with Filipino and Vietnamese coast guards are becoming more frequent. A war with Taiwan would likely trigger a conflict with the West, and controlling the sea lanes through which Chinese, Japanese, and Taiwanese trade passes would give China the ability to attack Western economies and strangle Taiwan. While many experts believe that reunification would be a pyrrhic victory, as it would lead to a war with the US and a unprecedented economic crisis, Xi's motivations are driven by nationalism and a desire to heal the historical wound that the People's Republic carries since its founding.

**Taiwan Prepares for War Scenario as China Increases Military Pressure**
The People's Republic of China (PRC) considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and has increased military pressure to convey this message to the island. 'Let me emphasize that whatever the authorities in Taiwan say or do, they cannot change the fact that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China,' said Lin Jian, spokesperson for the PRC's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 'Nor can they change the trend that both sides of the Strait must and will be reunified.' Taiwan has been governed autonomously since 1949, when the nationalists lost the Chinese Civil War to the Communist Party and took refuge in Taiwan, which maintains the official name of the Republic of China. It has its own constitution and democratically elected leaders. However, the threat of reunification looms over the island, which is regularly targeted by Chinese military maneuvers. In October 14, Beijing deployed a record 125 fighter jets, warships, and the aircraft carrier Liaoning in military exercises around Taiwan and its peripheral islands.

**Global Conflict: 56 Active Armed Conflicts Threaten World Peace**
There are 56 active armed conflicts in the world, the highest number since World War II. The conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Iran is escalating, with Israel launching a reprisal attack against Iranian targets. The conflict has been ongoing since October 7, 2023, and has resulted in over 41,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The war in Ukraine has been overshadowed by the conflict in the Middle East, but it continues to simmer, with Russia and Ukraine having high and low points in the conflict. The war in Yemen has been ongoing for 10 years, with the Houthis, backed by Iran, fighting against the Yemeni government, supported by Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Arab states. The conflict has resulted in over 233,000 deaths, according to the United Nations. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, there have been ongoing conflicts for 30 years, with groups of rebels supported by external actors fighting against the central government. The conflict has resulted in the displacement of 1.6 million people, according to the International Organization for Migration. In Sudan, the conflict has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and 9 million displaced people, according to the United Nations. The conflict in the two Koreas is ongoing, with North Korea launching periodic missile tests, and the United States maintaining a significant military presence in South Korea. The conflict between China and Taiwan is also ongoing, with China conducting regular military exercises around the island, which is recognized by the United States as a sovereign state. 'These are two conflicts that seem quiet, but have the potential to escalate quickly due to their own nature and the involvement of highly armed states,' said Ivan Briscoe, director of the Crisis Group's program on conflict policies. 'The fear is that Israel and Iran will enter a logic of confrontation that will force the United States to enter the conflict and that this will lead to Iran responding with all its conventional forces and the activities of the groups that support it. This is an extremely dangerous situation,' he added.

**Global Conflicts: A Growing Threat to Peace**
There are 92 countries involved in conflicts worldwide, with 56 active armed conflicts, the highest number since World War II. The conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Iran has escalated, with Israel launching a reprisal attack on Iranian targets. The war in Ukraine has been overshadowed by the Middle East conflict, but it continues with no signs of a short-term solution. The conflict in the Korean Peninsula remains open, with North and South Korea still technically at war. Tensions between China and Taiwan are also increasing, with China conducting regular military exercises around the island. According to Ivan Briscoe, director of the Crisis Group, the fear is that Israel and Iran will enter a logic of confrontation that will force the United States to enter the conflict, leading to a response from Iran with all its conventional forces and the activities of its supporting groups. The situation is extremely dangerous, with the risk of nuclear war. Briscoe also warned that the conflict in Yemen, which has caused 223,000 deaths, including 11,000 children under 5, is largely ignored by the media. The conflict in Sudan, which has caused tens of thousands of deaths, is also underreported. The world is facing a multitude of conflicts, with many more than are reported in the media.

**Taiwan 'Will Not Give Up One Inch of Territory,' President Lai Ching-te Says**
Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te reaffirmed the island's territorial sovereignty during a symbolic visit to the Kinmen archipelago on October 25, 2024. This statement comes amidst growing military tensions with mainland China. The Kinmen islands, located just five kilometers from the Chinese coast, are a strategic hotspot in Sino-Taiwanese relations. The president's visit to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Guningtou is particularly significant, as it was here that nationalist forces repelled the communist offensive in 1949, preserving their control over the archipelago. President Lai Ching-te's position is clear: 'We will not give up one inch of territory in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.' This presidential visit comes at a delicate time, following military exercises conducted by both China and Taiwan in the strait, including live fire drills. The history of this division dates back to the Chinese Civil War between the communist forces of Mao Zedong and the nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek. After their defeat on the mainland and the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, the nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan with many civilians. Beijing, which considers Taiwan a province to be reunified, officially prefers a peaceful approach while not ruling out the use of force. Relations have deteriorated significantly since 2016, when Tsai Ing-wen came to power, followed by Lai Ching-te's election in 2024. In response to these leaders, accused by Beijing of deepening the cultural divide between the island and the mainland, China has intensified its military presence around Taiwan.

**Xi Jinping Calls on China's Army to Prepare for War with Taiwan**
The conflict between Taiwan and China has been escalating for several years, with the latest development being a statement from Chinese President Xi Jinping calling on the army to prepare for war. The article outlines the key milestones in the conflict, its causes, and the interest of other countries in the situation. China considers Taiwan its territory due to the Chinese Civil War, where the Communist Party won and established the People's Republic of China, while the supporters of the Nationalist Party were forced to flee to Taiwan. The article also highlights the importance of Taiwan in global trade, particularly in the production of microchips, with Taiwan's TSMC and UMC companies producing over half of the world's semiconductors. The escalation of relations between the US and China over Taiwan could significantly impact global supply chains, warns Bloomberg. The US sees China as a major geopolitical opponent, while China aims to become a leader in ten high-tech industries. Xi Jinping has begun military exercises and called on the army to prepare for war, citing the need to deter Taiwan's independence and test the military's capabilities.

**China's President Xi Jinping Calls for Enhanced Combat Readiness Amid Taiwan Tensions**
Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for the country's military to increase its combat readiness, according to official media reports. This comes after China conducted large-scale military exercises around the island of Taiwan, which has seen escalating tensions with Beijing. During a visit to a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's missile force on Thursday, Xi emphasized the need for the military to 'strengthen its training and prepare for war comprehensively, and ensure it has strong combat capabilities', as reported by state-run CCTV. He also stressed that the military must 'enhance its strategic capabilities in the fields of deterrence and combat' to maintain the country's security and interests. China considers Taiwan, which has a degree of autonomy, to be an integral part of its territory and has vowed to retake it by force if necessary. In this context, Beijing conducted a simulation of a blockade of the island on Monday, sending fighter jets, naval vessels, and coast guard ships. This is the fourth such exercise in over two years, reflecting the escalating military tensions between the two sides. The conflict between China and Taiwan dates back to the Chinese Civil War between the Communist Party led by Mao Zedong and the Nationalist Party led by Chiang Kai-shek. After the Communist Party's victory and the establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, the Nationalists retreated to Taiwan, which has since established its own government and military. The Chinese military is one of the strongest in the world, with a vast arsenal of ballistic missiles, advanced fighter jets, and nuclear submarines. China is also seeking to enhance its capabilities in areas such as artificial intelligence and cyber warfare. The annual 'Defense Budget of the People's Republic of China' report highlights the focus on innovation and modernization to enhance military readiness, reflecting the growing defense spending and strategic orientations towards achieving a comprehensive combat capability by 2035. During his speech, Xi emphasized that the military must 'strongly protect the country's strategic security and core interests'. These statements coincide with the escalating tensions in the South China Sea and trade disputes with the United States, underscoring the need for constant preparedness for any emergency that may affect national security. Xi's call for enhanced combat readiness comes in a complex regional context and amid ongoing tensions over Taiwan. The recent military exercises are a strong message showing Beijing's readiness to escalate if necessary, keeping the island at the center of the strategic conflict between China and other global powers.

**China-Taiwan Weekly Update, October 18, 2024**
The People's Republic of China (PRC) launched a large-scale military exercise, Joint Sword 2024B, around Taiwan in response to Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's National Day speech. The exercise simulated a blockade of Taiwan and featured a significantly expanded role for the Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) in blockade operations. The PRC framed Lai's speech as a new level of 'provocation' even though the speech was more restrained than his inaugural address. The PRC's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Chen Binhua said that Lai advocated a 'new two-state theory' of 'mutual non-subordination,' fabricated the fallacy of 'Taiwan independence,' and incited hostile confrontation between the two sides of the strait. The PRC announced sanctions against Taiwanese DPP legislator Puma Shen, United Microelectronics Corporation founder Robert Tsao, and Shen's Kuma Academy civil defense organization. The PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced sanctions on October 10 against three US defense firms and ten senior executives over military aid to Taiwan that the United States approved on September 29. Russia and the PRC concluded joint naval drills and patrols in the Pacific. The PRC's military exercises around Taiwan in August 2022, an unnamed precursor to Joint Sword, went even further by overlapping in some areas with Taiwan's sovereign territorial waters. The PLA is developing its capacity to operate anywhere around Taiwan and establish sea and air control wherever it may need to. The Liaoning aircraft carrier group operated in Joint Sword 2024B to the southeast of Taiwan, past the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the Philippines. Approximately 90 J-15 fighter jets and 40 carrier-based helicopters took off from the Liaoning in one day, compared to 80 fighter jets and 40 helicopters from the Shandong in three days during the inaugural Joint Sword exercise in April 2023. The CCG played a much more prominent role in the exercise than it did in previous exercises around Taiwan, which indicates that the PRC plans for it to play a critical role in a potential blockade of Taiwan. 17 CCG ships participated in the exercise around Taiwan, the same as the number of PLA ships. The CCG released a rough map of the patrol that depicted the route in the shape of a heart around Taiwan, with the message 'the patrol is in the shape of loving you.'

**China Warns of Risk of Taiwan's Destruction in Case of Conflict**
China's official representative to the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, Chen Binhu, stated that China seeks a peaceful reunification with the island, but is not willing to give up the option of using force. He warned of the risk of Taiwan's destruction in the event of a conflict, saying, 'Regardless of how many troops and weapons Taiwan has, and regardless of whether external forces intervene or not, if Taiwan dares to take the risk, it will lead to its own destruction. Our actions to protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity will not stop for a moment.' China and Taiwan have had no official contact since the Communist Party of China defeated the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War in 1949. However, business and informal relations between the two have been re-established since the late 1980s. The current tensions between Taiwan and China escalated after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island in August 2022. China, which considers Taiwan a province, condemned the visit as support for Taiwanese separatism and conducted large-scale military exercises. This week, China began large-scale military exercises 'Joint Sharp Sword 2024B' around Taiwan, which includes practicing joint assaults, blockades, and taking control of key ports and areas on the island. Taiwan authorities have described China's actions as a massive provocation.

**Global Conflict and Diplomacy: Key Developments**
The conflict between Israel and Palestine, as well as the situation in Lebanon, have been major topics of discussion. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has resulted in 42,344 deaths in the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Jordan, Ayman al-Safadi, stated that 'if the fire reaches the holy sites, it will engulf the entire region.' The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Hakan Fidan, stated that 'the events in Gaza are a clear indication that the international system was designed, used, and functions in the interests of a certain minority.' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that if Israel's aggression is not stopped, it will lead to catastrophic consequences. In other news, over 14,000 people have been vaccinated against the Mpox virus in the North Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has denied allegations that Ukraine is involved in supplying drones to rebels in Mali. Russia and China have expressed shared views on global issues and prospects for bilateral cooperation, according to the Russian Defense Minister, Andrei Belyusov. The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense reported that 153 Chinese aircraft and 36 ships were detected around the island. A member of the terrorist organization Al-Qaeda, Ahmet Baykara, was arrested by the Turkish National Intelligence Organization in Africa. A French citizen, Laurent Vinatier, was sentenced to three years in prison by the Zamoskvoretsky Court in Moscow for collecting information on Russia's military activities as a foreign agent. Russian President Vladimir Putin has temporarily transferred the assets of the American company Universal Beverage Company to the Federal Property Management Agency.

**China and Taiwan: The Keys to a Complex Sociopolitical Relationship**
China's military exercises on October 14, following Taiwan's National Day on October 10, highlight the complex history between the two, with Beijing seeking to reaffirm its control over the self-governing island. The relationship between China and Taiwan is marked by crucial events that have shaped the current situation. Taiwan, which considers itself a sovereign nation, has faced constant pressure from Beijing, which considers it a rebellious province. The military exercises are seen as a warning against 'separatist acts'. These acts occurred days after Taiwan's president reaffirmed the island's autonomy and commitment to maintaining its independence in the face of growing Chinese pressure. The dispute over sovereignty is at the heart of the conflict, given Taiwan's self-determination and the principle of 'one China', which holds that there is only one Chinese state, and Taiwan is part of it. China proposed the option of 'one country, two systems', which would allow Taiwan to enjoy significant autonomy under Beijing's control. However, the Taiwanese government rejected this proposal due to the repercussions it had in Hong Kong in 1997. The key events in the history between China and Taiwan include the first inhabitants of Taiwan, Austronesian tribes, followed by Chinese colonizers in the 3rd century AD, and after being administered by the Qing dynasty, Taiwan was ceded to Japan after the First Sino-Japanese War. After World War II, Taiwan was occupied by the Republic of China (ROC), which was established with the support of its allies, the United States and the United Kingdom. However, after the Kuomintang's defeat in the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949), the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) retreated to Taiwan in 1949, where it established an independent and authoritarian government until 1980. Since then, China has considered Taiwan a rebellious province, and the People's Republic of China (PRC) has not renounced the use of force to achieve reunification. China's recent military exercises, 'Joint Sword-2024B', were held in the Taiwan Strait and surrounding areas, involving a significant number of forces, including 17 warships and 125 military aircraft. These simulations were described as a warning to Taiwan's 'separatist forces' and were seen as a strategic move to demonstrate China's military capabilities in the region. Unlike the more aggressive exercises in 2022, which included missile launches, the recent exercises seemed more calibrated, possibly to avoid a further escalation in the context of the US elections. The US response to these tensions is crucial, as the country has committed to providing defensive arms to Taiwan and has expressed its willingness to defend the island militarily, adding another layer of complexity to the relationship between China and Taiwan. In 2022, after the visit of the US House of Representatives Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Taiwan, China reacted with an unprecedented military deployment, conducting military exercises around the island as a reprisal. The current political context and economic interests at play are also significant, as many Taiwanese consider themselves part of a separate nation, despite the majority supporting maintaining the status quo, avoiding both a formal declaration of independence and unification with China. The ambiguity, in part generated by historical disputes, in their identity has led to continuous tensions, especially with recent speeches by Taiwanese leaders rejecting Chinese representation. Furthermore, the decision last year by the Honduran government to end its commercial relations with Taiwan and join the list of those supporting 'one China' and establishing relations with China, left the island with only 13 diplomatic allies. In the Americas, Taiwan has the support of Guatemala, Belize, Haiti, and the islands of Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean. And in the rest of the world, it is recognized by the Vatican City, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), and the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, and Tuvalu in Oceania. The United States maintains official relations with Beijing and recognizes it as the sole Chinese government under its 'one China' policy, but at the same time, it has become the international defender of Taiwan. Additionally, economic interests are significant, as Taiwan is a leader in the production of semiconductors, a strategic sector for the global economy, which increases the pressure on the relationships between the involved powers.

**China's Expert: Situation Around Taiwan Less Tense Than Before**
According to Lu Jun, the executive director of the Center for Russia Studies at the East China Normal University, the situation around Taiwan is less tense than it was in the past. Lu Jun stated, 'The main issue, especially in the military sphere, is not the conflict between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, but the behind-the-scenes actions of a third party - the United States.' He added that China is increasing its military capabilities to be prepared for potential military actions, with the main goal being technical modernization and improving the quality of its weapons and army. Lu Jun noted, 'We are currently focusing on a peaceful resolution to the conflict around Taiwan, but in extreme cases, we will be prepared to use military methods.' He emphasized that China's main goal is to modernize the country by 2050, the centennial anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and that the Taiwan issue must be resolved by then.

**China-Taiwan War: Why an Inevitable Conflict Looms**
The war between China and Taiwan seems inevitable, with China's President Xi Jinping having promised to reunify the island by 2049. Recent military exercises by China have raised concerns, with Taiwan's President William Lai convening an emergency meeting of the National Security Council. Taiwan has a modern and well-equipped military, but China's military is the largest in the world. The US has warned that it will not stand idly by if China attacks Taiwan, which could lead to a global war. China has been studying ways to invade Taiwan, including a possible cyber attack to cause a blackout, followed by a massive bombing campaign using hypersonic missiles. The US and NATO may be drawn into the conflict, making a war between China and Taiwan a certainty. The only question is when it will happen.

**China-Taiwan Conflict: A Half-Century of Tensions**
The conflict between China and Taiwan has been ongoing for over half a century. It began with the Chinese Civil War between the supporters of the Republic of China (Kuomintang) and the communists (Communist Party of China). The communists won, and the Republic of China was established on Taiwan. The Kuomintang has been in power on the island for a long time, with a focus on defense against the People's Liberation Army of China, which claims Taiwan. There have been several crises in the Taiwan Strait, including in 1954-1955, 1958, 1995-1996. The situation on Taiwan has changed over time, with the Kuomintang becoming more liberal and relations with China improving. However, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has gained popularity, and its representatives have been competing with the Kuomintang for power on the island. The DPP sees Taiwan as an independent state, while the Kuomintang advocates for reunification with mainland China. The current situation is tense, with the DPP's Tsai Ing-wen in power and the US supporting Taiwan. In 2022, US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, which was seen as a provocation by China. In 2024, Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te (also known as William Lai) called for China to recognize Taiwan's independence and met with US congressmen. China responded by saying it would not give up its 'one China' policy. In October 2024, Lai reiterated his call for independence, and China responded with military exercises around Taiwan, including a 'Joint Sharp Sword-2024B' exercise that involved ground and rocket forces, the navy, and air force. The Chinese military said the exercise was to block key ports and territories on the island and to deter separatist forces seeking independence. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense condemned China's actions as 'provocative' and promised to respond with its own forces.

**Escalating Global Tensions: Ukraine, Middle East, and Taiwan**
Global tensions are escalating with ongoing conflicts and provocative actions threatening stability in various regions. In Ukraine, the war with Russia continues to devastate the country, with thousands of casualties and a devastating humanitarian impact. The situation in the Middle East is also concerning, with violence reaching high levels in the conflict between Israel, Hamas, and Lebanon, which has triggered one of the most severe crises in the region in recent years, involving international powers and raising concerns of escalation. Meanwhile, tensions between China and Taiwan are adding uncertainty, with Beijing intensifying its military exercises around the island, fueling fears of a potential conflict that represents a direct challenge to the world order. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Chinese military has announced the start of joint air and naval exercises around Taiwan's main and peripheral islands. These maneuvers involve the army, navy, air force, and missile forces, simulating a possible blockade. China has deployed 17 warships, including the aircraft carrier Liaoning, and 125 fighter jets, the highest number of air forces ever deployed. Wu Qian, the spokesperson for the Chinese Defense Ministry, has reiterated that warnings for 'separatist acts' in Taiwan will be repeated with increasing intensity if the island does not abandon its 'independentist' rhetoric. 'Taiwan will never be an autonomous country,' and China 'will never give up the use of force,' Wu Qian said. Li Xi, spokesperson for the Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, described the exercises, dubbed 'Joint Sword-2024B,' as a legitimate and necessary operation for the defense of China's sovereignty and national unity. The announcement comes after Taiwan's new president, Lai Ching-te, reaffirmed the island's sovereignty in his speech last Thursday, rejecting China's claims on Taiwan while launching a conciliatory message. Lai marked strongly that Beijing has never governed the island and, although he invited calm, Beijing considers him a strong supporter of Taiwan's independence. This represents a red line for the leaders of the Communist Party of China, who consider the island part of their territory. Taiwan's response was swift, with the Ministry of Defense condemning these actions as 'irrational provocation' and sending military forces to monitor the situation, reaffirming Taiwan's firm will to defend its sovereignty and pointing the finger at the Communist Party of China, which it holds responsible for the growing tensions and threats to peace in the Taiwan Strait. According to the Taiwanese military, Beijing's constant intimidation and pressure aim to limit Taiwan's international presence. The Chinese military had already conducted a similar exercise in May, dubbed 'Joint Sword-2024A,' shortly after Lai's inauguration. According to Ben Lewis, co-founder of PLATracker, an organization that monitors Chinese military activities, Lai's statements provided Beijing with the ideal pretext to maintain its promise of another major exercise. With the war in Ukraine continuing without signs of a ceasefire, the conflict in Israel risking the involvement of additional regional actors, and China increasing threats on Taiwan, the risk of a convergence of global crises that could lead to a perilous escalation appears increasingly real, raising fears of a dangerous increase in hostilities on multiple fronts with uncertain outcomes.

**China Begins Military Exercises Around Taiwan, Warning of 'Separatist Forces'**
China has begun military exercises around Taiwan, stating that it is a 'strict warning to separatist forces' on the island. Taiwan has called the maneuvers a provocation and has sent its own forces in response. According to the 'Xinhua' news agency, the 'Joint Sword – 2024B' exercises in the Taiwan Strait involve the army, navy, air force, and rocket forces. Chinese military officials plan to 'focus on blocking and taking control of key ports and areas, and striking at sea and land targets', said Li Xi, an official representative of the Eastern Zone of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The exercises will serve as a 'powerful shock and fear for separatist forces', added the Chinese commander. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has convened an emergency meeting on national security and has instructed relevant agencies to respond to China's actions. Meanwhile, in the Pacific, joint exercises between Chinese and Russian naval forces are underway. The Russian Ministry of Defense reported on October 14 that 6 ships from both countries are participating in the maneuvers, which included joint anti-submarine operations and live-fire exercises. China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and is increasing military pressure on the island. In May, the People's Liberation Army of China conducted large-scale military exercises in the Taiwan Strait and around the group of islands controlled by Taiwan off the Chinese coast. According to official representatives of Beijing, the exercises involving the army, navy, air force, and rocket forces in areas near the island state's borders are a response to 'separatist actions'. Taiwan officially calls itself the Republic of China, as historically after the Communist victory in China and the proclamation of the PRC, Taiwanese authorities claimed themselves as the legitimate government of all China. This is also why Taiwan has not formally declared independence from China. Taiwan's partners, including the US, have expressed their commitment to the 'One China' policy. At the same time, they categorically oppose the use of force by China. Some politicians in Taipei believe that the threat of an armed conflict between the 'two Chinas' today is the highest in over 40 years. According to the Ministry of Defense and special services of Taiwan, Beijing plans to launch a full-scale military aggression against Taiwan in 2025 – and this has been stated, for example, in an interview with Radio Liberty by the former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan Joseph Wu.

**Taiwanese Ministry of Defense: No intention to escalate conflicts with China**
The Ministry of Defense of Taiwan has stated that it does not intend to escalate conflicts with China in the face of China's military exercises in the Taiwan Strait. According to the ministry, all officers and soldiers have been instructed to 'be more vigilant, increase monitoring, and coordinate their actions', as well as to closely cooperate with the coastal patrol and other units to 'follow the principle of restraint' and respond in a way that 'does not escalate conflicts and does not cause disputes'. The ministry also noted that experts and military personnel will be monitoring the movements of China's rocket troops. Meanwhile, the Taiwan Transportation Ministry stated that Taiwan's airports and ports are operating normally despite China's exercises. The exercises, code-named 'Joint Sword - 2024B', are focused on air-sea combat and patrolling, as well as blocking key ports and attacking maritime and land targets. Taiwan has previously reported the approach of 43 Chinese aircraft and 8 ships on September 26, as well as 34 aircraft crossing the median line of the Taiwan Strait and entering the identification zone of Taiwan's air defense system. The escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan began after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island in August 2022. China considers Taiwan to be its territory and views visits by officials from other countries as support for Taiwan's independence. Official relations between the Chinese government and its island province were severed in 1949 after the defeat of the Kuomintang forces in the civil war with the Communist Party of China. Contacts between the island and mainland China were resumed in the late 1980s. The US openly supports the authorities of Taiwan.

**China-Taiwan Weekly Update, October 11, 2024**
The China-Taiwan Weekly Update, a joint product from the Institute for the Study of War and the American Enterprise Institute, reported on key developments in the region. The People's Republic of China (PRC) accused Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te of promoting separatism and inciting cross-strait confrontation in his National Day speech. The PRC urged Czechia and other 'relevant countries' not to interact with Taiwanese 'separatist forces' in response to former President Tsai Ing-wen's plans to visit Czechia. The FBI announced charges against five PRC nationals who were caught near a US military base in August 2023 during annual exercises. The China Coast Guard (CCG) fired water cannons at Philippine civilian vessels completing a resupply mission at Scarborough Shoal. Vietnam accused PRC law enforcement of attacking 10 Vietnamese fishermen near the Paracel Islands. The PRC aims to defend its control over the maritime features it administers and deny other states the ability to extract resources in areas it claims. The PRC supported a Russian draft proposal at the United Nations that calls for a UN investigation into the destruction of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline in September 2022. The militant group Baloch Liberation Army killed two Chinese nationals in an IED attack in Karachi on October 6. The Philippines and the Republic of Korea (ROK) signed six bilateral agreements and elevated their ties to a 'strategic partnership.' The two states have been steadily increasing their military ties through joint exercises and weapons sales over the past year. The establishment of close military relations with the United States, Japan, the ROK, and others may be intended to send a message to the PRC and warn against escalation within Philippine maritime territory.

**Better defending Taiwan against China’s gray zone assault**
The People's Republic of China (PRC) has been using gray zone tactics to assert sovereignty over Taiwan, including military incursions, cyberattacks, and election interference. According to Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense, the PRC has intruded into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) with an average of 19 aircraft and 9 vessels per day in August 2024. The PRC has also been targeting Taiwanese public opinion through disinformation campaigns and media warfare. Taiwan Minister of Defense Wellington Koo Li-hsiung stated that Taiwan faces over 5 million cyber-attacks daily, primarily from the PRC. The PRC's goal is to coerce Taiwan into peaceful unification with the mainland without direct conflict. However, public opinion in Taiwan largely favors maintaining autonomy, and the PRC's efforts have been limited so far. To counteract the PRC's actions, 'peace through collective strength' should feature solutions to the cross-strait security dilemma, including multilateral frameworks and leveraging advanced capabilities from like-minded allies.

**Better Defending Taiwan Against China's Gray Zone Assault**
The People's Republic of China (PRC) has been using gray zone tactics to assert sovereignty over Taiwan, including military incursions, cyberattacks, and election interference. According to Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense, the PRC has maintained daily incursions against Taiwanese water, air, and near-shore islands, with a peak of 103 PLA aircraft intruding into the Taiwan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) on September 18, 2023. The PRC has also increased the frequency and diversity of aircraft commissioned for incursion, with an average daily number of 19 aircraft and nine PLAN vessels in August 2024. Taiwan's Minister of Defense, Wellington Koo Li-hsiung, stated that Taiwan faces over 5 million cyber-attacks daily, primarily from the PRC. The PRC's gray zone tactics aim to coerce Taiwan into peaceful unification with the mainland without direct conflict, by isolating Taiwan diplomatically and distorting the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758. However, public opinion in Taiwan largely favors maintaining autonomy, reflecting the resilience of Taiwanese democracy against coercion.
