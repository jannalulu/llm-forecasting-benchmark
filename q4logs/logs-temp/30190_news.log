**Could Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Grow 10x Over the Next 3 Years?**
Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is one of the 8 Stocks That Could 10X Over the Next 3 Years. As the new US presidency takes office in January 2025, investors are concerned about the impact of new policies on big tech. Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO of IBM, expects more innovation and less regulation in the tech sector, with 'guardrails.' William Kerwin, an analyst at Morningstar Technology, emphasizes that tariffs are a crucial element, with a proposed 60% tariff on Chinese imports posing severe headwinds for companies reliant on the region. However, Kerwin is optimistic about mergers and acquisitions and antitrust regulations, expecting more deals to come through and regulations to focus on platforms and use cases rather than specific companies or products. He also suggests that companies well-exposed to artificial intelligence are overvalued, but sees opportunities in the chip equipment and semiconductor sectors, particularly in companies that are well-positioned despite cyclicality worries and fears of AI maturity.

**Is Microsoft Going to $505? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks So | The Motley Fool**
Microsoft's stock has been declining, down 10% from its peak in July, and has missed out on the latest rally in tech stocks. However, one analyst from KeyCorp, sees upside potential in Microsoft, hiking its price target from $490 to $505 and maintaining an overweight rating on the stock. The analyst cites a recent survey showing a rebound in the company's performance and IT budgets heading into next year, with IT budgets expected to grow 4.4% in 2025. KeyBanc's new price target implies a 21% upside in the stock. However, there are valid questions facing the stock, including its valuation and ability to justify its investments in AI.

**Has Microsoft's Stock Hit a Peak? | The Motley Fool**
Microsoft's stock has fallen 12% from its 52-week high, but analysts' targets remain bullish. The company's market cap is around $3 trillion, and it has benefited from its investments in artificial intelligence (AI). However, its share price has fallen by 3% in the past six months, and its year-to-date gains trail the S&P 500. Analysts' average price target is around $494, indicating a potential 20% rise in the next year. However, the company's results in upcoming quarters may be underwhelming, leading to downgrades and price target cuts. Microsoft's diversified businesses and long-term growth opportunities make it a good stock to own, but its high price-to-earnings multiple of 35 may be a concern. The company's AI assistant, Copilot, has not been winning over customers, and its heavy investments in AI are eating into its bottom line. If Microsoft doesn't demonstrate strong top- and bottom-line growth in its fiscal 2025 Q1 report, bearishness could increase, and analysts could downgrade the stock and cut their price targets.

**Has Microsoft's Stock Hit a Peak?**
Microsoft's stock has stalled in the past six months, with a 3% decline in share price and year-to-date gains of 10% trailing the S&P 500's 20% increase. Despite its investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and new AI capabilities, the company's valuation may be too high to attract growth investors. Wall Street analysts predict a 20% rise in the stock's price over the next year, but this is a moving target and may change based on upcoming quarterly results. Microsoft's diversified businesses and long-term growth opportunities make it a good stock to own, but its high price-to-earnings multiple of 35 and recent underwhelming quarterly results may lead to downgrades and price target cuts. The company's ongoing investments in AI are also eating into its bottom line, and a further challenge to the stock may come from its fiscal 2025 Q1 report, which could demonstrate weak top- and bottom-line growth. Microsoft may have hit a peak in the near term, but it remains a great long-term investment.

**Microsoft Stock Price Shows Unprecedented Drop Since March 2022**
The stock price of Microsoft showed a significant drop on Tuesday, a trend not seen since March 2022. Despite a 10% gain since the beginning of the year, the 50-day moving average for the company's stock fell to $417.91, down from $418.17 on Monday. The 200-day moving average also rose to $417, up from $416.78. Analysts at FactSet predict that the 'death cross' pattern will occur as early as Thursday, with the short-term moving average falling below the 200-day moving average. The last time this pattern appeared was in mid-March 2022, when the stock price dropped by 16% over a four-month period, followed by a sharp decline of 45% until it reached its lowest point about a year later, according to FactSet.

**Microsoft's stock heads for a 'death cross' - but there are bigger chart problems**
Microsoft's stock is heading for a 'death cross' pattern, where the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average, but this is not the only technical sign that may be concerning for bulls. According to BTIG technical analyst Jonathan Krinsky, the fact that the 50-DMA is falling and trading below the 200-DMA for the third time in as many months is 'clearly not a great sign.' Additionally, Microsoft's stock has recently broken below a year-long upward channel and key support levels on a relative-strength basis, and has dropped to its lowest levels since August 2023. Krinsky wrote, 'In absolute terms, it remains OK above $400, but the one-year relative low is not a great sign.' Microsoft shares have dropped 11.4% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 has gained 3%.

**Microsoft Stock: Price Drop Despite Positive Analyst Projections**
Microsoft's stock price declined by 0.4% to $414.60 on the NASDAQ, despite positive analyst projections. Analysts set an average target price of $475.75, indicating significant upside potential. The company's robust financial situation is reflected in its quarterly earnings: a 15.20% revenue increase to $64.73 billion and earnings per share of $2.96. Microsoft's success is driven by continuous innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence. Experts predict a profit of $13.20 per share for the 2025 fiscal year, underscoring confidence in the company's long-term growth strategy. Despite short-term market fluctuations, Microsoft remains an attractive investment for investors seeking technological innovation and solid growth.

**Two Apple stock rivals to turn $100 into $1,000 in 2025**
With Apple (AAPL) stock reaching a new all-time high in July, some analysts expect it to hit a market capitalization of $4 trillion next year. However, other stocks like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) have the potential to bring substantial profit to their investors, possibly allowing them to turn an investment of $100 into $1,000 in 2025. Microsoft's significant investments in artificial intelligence and its vast product portfolio have led BMO Capital Markets to raise its price target to $500. Amazon's diversified income flows and recent launch of Project Amelia, an AI-backed selling assistant, make it a strong contender. Currently, MSFT stock stands at $418.16, while AMZN stock is at $184.55. While these stocks have strong foundations, trends in the stock market can easily change, and doing one's own research is critical.

**Microsoft Stock: 3 Reasons It's Ready to Crush Q4**
Microsoft's stock has been struggling to regain momentum since reaching all-time highs in June and July. However, the company's recent 17% drop is starting to look like a healthy correction, and it has been up more than 10% since then. As we approach the final quarter of the year, there are several reasons to think Microsoft's multi-year rally has begun. These include the company's strong fundamentals, with record revenue and second-highest EPS number, as well as its ability to grow total revenues by over 15% year on year. Additionally, the company has boosted its dividend and authorized a $60 billion buyback of shares, indicating management's optimism about the years ahead. Many analysts are also bullish on the stock, with price targets above $500, and the technical setup of the stock is strong, with higher lows being set on the way up. Investors should look for shares to stay above $410 on any pullback from here, with a move above $440 indicating the stock is ready to start testing July's all-time high.
