He has also called for reforming the FDA, USDA, and CDC to end corruption and provide honest information to the public. Massie secured another term in the House during the 2024 election and has been a vocal advocate for Trump's agenda, despite previously endorsing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president.

**Massie signals he is open to agriculture role in Trump administration**
Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has expressed his willingness to accept a role concerning agriculture in President-elect Trump's administration, but denied a rumor that he has already accepted the position of Agriculture secretary. Massie stated, 'President Trump's resounding victory secured a mandate for big ideas like reversing chronic disease, conserving our land, and empowering American farmers.' He also clarified that he has received no commitments or offers from Trump's team, and any discussion of the transition are premature. This comes after Joel Salatin, a farmer and blogger, wrote that Massie would be Agriculture secretary in the Trump administration. Massie has a mixed history with Trump, but they have since repaired their relationship and endorsed each other in their elections. Massie has been praising the benefits of raw milk versus pasteurized milk, despite warnings from government health authorities about risks of foodborne illnesses.

**Massie for Secretary of Agriculture? KY Congressman addresses talk of Trump admin role**
Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) has expressed openness to taking a role in the incoming Donald Trump administration, potentially as Secretary of Agriculture. Massie stated, 'President Trump's resounding victory secured a mandate for big ideas like reversing chronic disease, conserving our land and empowering American farmers.' However, he emphasized that any discussion of the transition is premature, as he has received no commitments or offers from President Trump's team. The speculation over Massie's potential role began with Joel Salatin, who claims to have been contacted by the Trump transition team for an advisor role in the USDA and has accepted one of the six 'Advisor to the Secretary' spots, with Massie set to become Secretary of Agriculture. Massie's relationship with President-elect Trump has been topsy-turvy, but recent closeness with Robert Kennedy Jr. has revived the possibility of Massie entering the new administration next year.

Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who was once targeted by former President Donald Trump, has given Trump his 'full endorsement' for president.

**COI Presidential Candidates to Present Programs in January 2025**
In January 2025, the seven candidates for the presidency of the International Olympic Committee (COI) will present their programs in a closed session in Lausanne. The final vote will take place in March in Greece, where it will be decided who will succeed Thomas Bach. The presentations of the seven candidates for the presidency of the COI will be held on January 30, 2025, at the organization's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. Among the applicants is Johan Eliasch, president of the International Ski Federation and Snowboard (FIS). The meeting will be held in a closed session, following strictly the COI regulations that prohibit candidates from participating in public debates, publishing videos or holding open events to the public. This will be the only official act of the campaign before the final vote, which will take place in March during the 143rd Extraordinary Session of the COI in Greece. Lord Sebastian Coe, president of World Athletics and with a solid Olympic background, is the favorite to succeed Thomas Bach. However, the election is not decided, as the other candidates also have an important profile within the world of sports. The candidates are: The final election will take place between March 18 and 21 near ancient Olympia, in Greece, with the participation of approximately 100 COI members. Among these voters are prominent figures such as European and Middle Eastern royalty, sports leaders, current and retired Olympic athletes, politicians and influential businesspeople. The election process will take place in a private environment, following COI regulations, which aim to ensure a fair and transparent process. In addition to the presidential election, during the 143rd Extraordinary Session of the COI, the host city of the 2028 Winter Youth Olympic Games will be voted on. The COI has previously announced a 'direct dialogue' with the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) and the Dolomiti Valtellina project as possible organizers of these games. The current COI president, Thomas Bach, plans to leave his position in June 2025, after a three-month transition period with his successor. During his years at the helm of the COI, Bach has worked on important reforms, such as the Olympic Agenda 2020, which has promoted sustainability, inclusion and the legacy of the Olympic Games. His successor will face the challenge of continuing his legacy, while addressing current issues such as the digitalization of sports, gender equality and event management in a post-pandemic world.

**House Republican spurns Trump and writes in Ron DeSantis for president  --  and himself for VP**
Rep. Thomas Massie, a libertarian from Kentucky, has written in Ron DeSantis for president and himself for vice president on his 2024 ballot. Massie, who has a history of clashing with former President Donald Trump, said, 'I do NOT recommend this,' unless the outcome is already decided. Massie has been critical of Trump and has declined to issue a formal endorsement of him since he became the nominee. Massie's decision is not surprising, given his past disagreements with Trump and his own endorsement of DeSantis during the 2024 GOP presidential primary.

**Thomas Massie Warns DOJ Against Interfering with IG's January 6 Report**
Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) has warned Attorney General Merrick Garland that the Department of Justice (DOJ) will face consequences if they interfere with the release of the Investigator General's report on DOJ's activities on January 6. The report, which is expected to contain bombshell information, including the presence of confidential human sources (CHSs) on Capitol grounds, has been delayed by the DOJ. Massie's letter, signed by ten members of the House Judiciary Committee, reminds Garland of his previous testimony that the Inspector General is 'independent' and that the determination of the release of Inspector General reports is up to the Inspector General. Massie believes that politics is involved in the delay and is calling for the report to be released before the election. 'If you or any of your subordinates, associates, deputies, or agents within the Department act to delay or interfere with the release of this report, Congress will hold you accountable,' Massie's letter warns.

**Massimiliano Giansanti Elected as President of Copa**
Massimiliano Giansanti has been elected as the new president of Copa, the Committee of Professional Agricultural Organizations representing over 22 million farmers in Europe. Giansanti, who is currently the president of Confagricoltura, has assured that he will 'honour this responsibility with the utmost dedication' and will be 'president of all European farmers because I have always believed that only by acting as a cohesive reality can we compete in global scenarios, restoring dignity to European agriculture.' Giansanti's priorities include revising the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), defending farmers' income, and promoting reciprocity in trade with third countries. He assumes the role at a time of 'important challenges' for the EU, such as the enlargement of the Union to new member states and the need for a larger budget for the agricultural sector, as he pointed out. Congratulations and best wishes for his new role have arrived from the agro-food world to Massimiliano Giansanti. Cristiano Fini, president of Cia, recalls that this nomination rewards Giansanti's competence and dedication to European agriculture. 'Today's news is a great encouragement for all the important challenges we will face in the short and long term to ensure solid prospects for the primary sector,' said Paolo Mascarino, president of Federalimentare. 'This demonstrates the professionalism and competence of President Giansanti and, at the same time, attributes to Italy a central role in Europe for the future choices that will invest the sector in a time of great changes,' he added. 'For Italy, it is another seal of the prestige role that Italian agriculture has in Europe,' said Cristian Maretti, president of Legacoop Agroalimentare. 'We are certain that Giansanti can further promote the interests of farmers within European institutions, favouring a dialogue with all the other protagonists of the agro-food chain,' declared Fabio Massimo Pallottini, president of Italmercati. 'For us - wrote Onofrio Rota, secretary general of Fai-Cisl - it will be fundamental to have an interlocutor who can bring to Brussels a strong sensitivity not only towards the needs of businesses but also towards the demands of workers and workers.'

**Republican Takes Swipe at Mike Johnson for Needing Trump 'Lifeline'**
Representative Thomas Massie criticized House Speaker Mike Johnson's handling of a spending bill, stating that Johnson 'poorly handled' the bill's passage through the lower chamber. Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, also suggested that Johnson will only be reelected 'with a lifeline' from former President Donald Trump if the GOP presidential nominee wins in November. Johnson met with Trump to discuss the short-term spending bill and stated that the former president 'understands the situation that we're in.' The House rejected Johnson's stopgap bill, which included the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, that would require American voters to provide proof of citizenship in person when registering to vote in a federal election. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer plans to move forward with a bipartisan spending bill in his chamber, which would extend funding through mid-December, giving Congress more time to reach a long-term deal that would fund through the end of fiscal year 2025.

**Angélica Lozano Criticizes Gregorio Eljach's Selection as Procurador Candidate**
Senator Angélica Lozano criticized the choice of Gregorio Eljach as the candidate for procurador by President Gustavo Petro, saying 'They were left hanging'. Lozano pointed out that Eljach's name was not on the list of pre-selected candidates by the Presidency for the position. According to Lozano, 26 candidates were pre-selected, and citizens were able to send comments about their resumes, but after Eljach was chosen, Lozano said 'They were left hanging'. The selection process was announced by the Presidency on August 29, and 45 candidates applied, but only 26 met the requirements. Eljach is currently the Secretary General of the Senate, and his nomination was a surprise, as many expected President Petro to propose his personal lawyer, Héctor Carvajal, as a strong candidate. However, Eljach has a strong relationship with congressmen from various groups, which could be an advantage in the selection process. The new procurador will be elected in the Senate, and their term will begin in January 2025 and end in 2029. Experts suggest that this could be the last period of the organ, as a structural reform is being considered due to controversies over the scope of its determinations.

**IOC Presidential Election: Seven Candidates Announced, Including Surprise Candidate Johan Eliasch**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced seven candidates for the presidency, with elections set to take place in March 2025. The current president, Thomas Bach, will not be re-elected. The candidates are: Sebastian Coe (head of World Athletics), Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr. (IOC vice-president), David Laparte (head of the International Cycling Union), Faisal bin Hussein (prince of Jordan and IOC executive board member), Kirsty Coventry (IOC executive board member and two-time Olympic champion in swimming), Johan Eliasch (head of the International Ski Federation), and Moriarty Watanabe (head of the International Gymnastics Federation). Johan Eliasch, a Swedish-born British businessman, is a surprise candidate. He has been the head of the International Ski Federation for only three years and has a net worth of around £4 billion, making him one of the richest people in the UK. Eliasch's candidacy has been met with skepticism, particularly due to his decision to ban Russian athletes from international competitions, including the Olympics. Coventry is seen as the front-runner, with the support of Thomas Bach and a strong reputation in the Olympic community. However, the election process is strictly regulated, and candidates are not allowed to engage in personal travel or meetings with IOC members to avoid financial inequality. The official campaign will begin on January 20-24, 2025, in Lausanne, where each candidate will have the opportunity to present their platform to all IOC members. Despite the election, Thomas Bach will remain president until June 24, 2025, as per the IOC's constitution.

This decision has sparked a debate about who will succeed him, with Sebastian Coe, the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), being a strong contender. Coe has expressed his interest in the position and has the necessary qualifications, but he may face challenges due to the IOC's rules and the opposition from other candidates. The IOC's ethics committee has sent a letter to its 111 members, including the Norwegian representatives, Kristin Kloster Aasen and Astrid Uhrenholdt Jacobsen, outlining the rules for the election and highlighting restrictions that may affect Coe's eligibility. The letter, signed by Ban Ki Moon, the former UN Secretary-General and current chair of the IOC's ethics committee, is seen as a move to undermine Coe's candidacy. The election is expected to take place in January 2025, and the outcome will be determined by the 111 IOC members. The process is likely to be complex and may involve several challenges, including the nomination of candidates, the presentation of their platforms, and the voting process.

**Who Will Succeed Thomas Bach as IOC President?**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) will hold an election in March 2025 to choose a new president, as Thomas Bach has announced his resignation. The IOC has released guidelines for potential candidates, which include the requirement that they be an IOC member for the duration of their candidacy. This poses a problem for several high-profile candidates, including Sebastian Coe, the head of World Athletics, who is also an IOC member by virtue of his position. According to a letter from former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, candidates in this situation would need to change their IOC membership status in a separate vote. This is seen as an 'uncomfortable' and 'telling' development, particularly for men like Coe and others who may be affected. The letter is seen as an 'invitation' to women to run for the position.
