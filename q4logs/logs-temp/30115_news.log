**US, South Korea, Japan to Discuss Coordinated Response to North Korea's Potential Deployment of Troops to Russia**
The White House announced that the US, South Korea, and Japan will discuss a 'coordinated response' to North Korea's potential deployment of troops to Russia and its participation in the conflict in Ukraine at the upcoming trilateral summit on November 15. Jake Sullivan, the White House National Security Adviser, stated that the summit will provide an opportunity for the three leaders to confirm their shared understanding of North Korea's participation and coordinate their response. Sullivan emphasized that North Korea's potential deployment of troops to Ukraine would be a 'significant development' and that the three leaders would 'take it very seriously.' He also mentioned that the summit will discuss the possibility of North Korea's seventh nuclear test and the potential for a major provocation during the US presidential transition period. Sullivan stated, 'We will be watching very closely from now until January 20, 2025, the start of the next Trump administration.' The trilateral summit aims to establish a institutional framework for cooperation between the US, South Korea, and Japan, ensuring that their cooperation continues regardless of the US presidential transition.

**North Korean Troops Deployed to Ukraine to Support Russia's Military Efforts**
North Korean troops are being deployed to Ukraine to support Russia's military efforts, according to the US and Ukrainian governments. The move has sparked concern among Western leaders, who fear it could destabilize the region and threaten global security. The North Korean troops are part of a 10,000-strong contingent sent by Pyongyang to support Russia's military operations in Ukraine. The deployment is seen as a strategic move by Russia to bolster its military capabilities and counter the influence of the US and its allies. The North Korean troops are expected to play a key role in the upcoming battles in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces have been pushing back against Russian advances. The deployment has also raised concerns about the potential for conflict between North Korea and Ukraine, as well as the risks of nuclear proliferation. 'This is a game-changer for the region,' said Mark Rutte, the new Secretary General of NATO. 'The deployment of North Korean troops to Ukraine is a clear indication of Russia's willingness to take risks and challenge the international order.' The move has also been seen as a strategic partnership between Russia and North Korea, with both countries seeking to counter the influence of the US and its allies. 'This is a new era of cooperation between Russia and North Korea,' said Vladimir Putin, the Russian President. 'We are committed to working together to achieve our common goals and to defend our shared interests.' The deployment of North Korean troops to Ukraine has also raised concerns about the potential for human rights abuses and the treatment of prisoners of war. 'The North Korean military has a reputation for brutality and human rights abuses,' said Chad O'Carroll, a specialist on North Korea. 'We need to be concerned about the potential for atrocities and the treatment of prisoners of war.' The deployment of North Korean troops to Ukraine is a complex and sensitive issue, with far-reaching implications for global security and stability. 'This is a major development that requires careful consideration and a coordinated response from the international community,' said Andreï Lankov, a specialist on North Korea. 'We need to be vigilant and proactive in addressing the potential risks and challenges associated with this deployment.'

**North Korea's Deployment of Troops to Ukraine-Russia War Brings World Closer to Global Conflict**
North Korea's deployment of troops to the war between Russia and Ukraine has brought the world one step closer to a global war, according to American expert John Hemming. He notes that North Korea has provided significant material support to Russia's military efforts, including 8 million rounds of ammunition and various ballistic missiles. 'Deploying soldiers to help 50,000 Russians defend Kursk against exhausted Ukrainian military units is a significant escalation,' Hemming says. He warns that the consequences of this action could go beyond the war between Russia and Ukraine, particularly in the context of the Indo-Pacific region, as North Korean units fighting alongside Russian forces may gain access to modern technology and warfare tactics. 'In 2019, I wrote that the world was moving towards a 'new Cold War.' Few can argue that we are not heading in that direction now. And as North Korea's closer ties with Russia show, the future competition will likely have a truly global character,' Hemming concludes. US State Department officials have confirmed that North Korean troops are already fighting in the Kursk region, with many of the over 10,000 North Korean soldiers deployed to Russia now participating in combat operations alongside Russian forces.

**US Explains What Hinders Effectiveness of North Korean Soldiers in Russian Army**
According to the US State Department's official website, spokesperson Vedant Patel explained that the effectiveness of North Korean soldiers in the Russian army on the front lines will be hindered by several factors. Patel stated that the potential success of 'the second army of the world' on the battlefield, which involves the use of North Korean units, will largely depend on how well the Russian command can integrate this 'live force' into their occupying forces. Patel identified key challenges for this integration as a language barrier, coordination and command, management, and communication. The US has already begun close consultations with allies and other European countries to minimize the consequences of a negative development in the situation. As previously reported by our information portal, Borrell had urged Seoul to expand support for Ukraine amid the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia.

**US vows 'firm' response to North Korea for deploying troops in Ukraine**
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that the deployment of North Korean troops alongside Russian forces in Ukraine demands a 'firm response.' Blinken stated, 'We're counting on European partners and others to strongly support Ukraine's mobilization,' calling for more artillery, air defences, munitions, and training for Kyiv's forces. The US has confirmed that thousands of North Korean troops have begun engaging in combat operations alongside Russian forces in the Kursk region. Blinken described this development as 'a profound and incredibly dangerous development.' The US is committed to providing aid to Ukraine before Donald Trump takes office, with President Joe Biden stating that every dollar will be pushed out the door between now and January 20. However, the future of assistance for Ukraine is uncertain, with Trump's election victory and a political crisis in Germany heightening fears.

**South Korea to Send Military Personnel to Ukraine Amid North Korean Deployment**
South Korea plans to send an unspecified number of military personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops reportedly deployed in the Kursk region of Russia and Ukraine, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Experts at ISW also believe that Putin is not interested in a ceasefire through negotiations and continues to aim to destroy Ukrainian statehood. This is supported by statements from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who told Serbian President Alexander Vucic that Russia will achieve its goals in the 'special military operation' in Ukraine. Additionally, Putin stated during a press conference with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban that a ceasefire would allow Ukraine to regroup and rearm, which ISW and other non-Kremlin experts disagree with, saying that a ceasefire would only benefit Russia and give it time to further radicalize and militarize Russian society against Ukraine, and allow Russian troops to rest and recover before a potential future attack on Ukraine. 'A ceasefire through negotiations at the current lines and under the current circumstances would only benefit Russia and give the Kremlin time for further radicalization and militarization of Russian society against Ukraine, and Russian troops time to rest and recover, likely before a future attack on Ukraine,' said the ISW.

**North Korea Joins Russia's War Against Ukraine: Operational and Strategic Implications in Ukraine and Northeast Asia**
North Korea has deployed a contingent of troops to Russia in support of Russia's war in Ukraine. The deployment is part of a growing relationship between the two countries, which has been intensifying since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Kremlin is likely to leverage North Korean manpower to support its ongoing offensive efforts and offset requirements of Russia's domestic force generation capacity. North Korea's military has not experienced large-scale conventional combat since 1953 and understands that its doctrine is unprepared to fight in a modern war, especially against a sophisticated adversary such as South Korea. Pyongyang likely hopes that its forces will have the opportunity to refine offensive doctrine, test their weapons systems against a Western-provisioned adversary, gain command and control experience, and learn how to operate drones and electronic warfare (EW) systems on the modern battlefield. The actual ability of North Korean forces to absorb, disseminate, and institutionalize lessons learned on the battlefield is entirely contingent on how the Russian command uses North Korean manpower. If Russia uses North Korean personnel as 'cannon fodder,' the casualties that North Korean troops are sure to accrue will undermine whatever battlefield lessons Pyongyang hopes to learn. The deployment of North Korean troops to Russia emphasizes Putin's continued reliance on pursuing alternative force generation avenues to support the war effort instead of committing to a wider societal mobilization. Putin has continually taken efforts to support the Russian war effort without fully shifting Russian society to a wartime footing, apparently assessing that the domestic costs of ordering another involuntary reserve callup outweigh the benefits and opting instead to heavily rely on crypto and shadow mobilization. The manpower that can be generated by crypto-mobilization is finite, however, and certain recent developments on the battlefield have introduced increased friction into the delicate recruitment system that the Kremlin has constructed. Ukraine's August 2024 incursion into Kursk Oblast made this issue particularly acute, as the Russian military has suddenly had to reckon with committing manpower and materiel to an entirely new part of the theater. Putin's response to the incursion has been to leverage conscripts and border guards, create new territorial defense units, and redeploy active units away from non-critical frontline positions in Ukraine, consistent with how he has handled managing force generation requirements throughout the war thus far. The use of North Korean troops is therefore an extension of the Kremlin's force generation approach — it allows Russia to build out its fighting force with up to 12,000 fresh personnel (for now) without needing to conduct a socially-costly domestic mobilization and deal with the resulting fall-out. The Russian command will send North Korean personnel first and foremost to Kursk Oblast, as confirmed by Ukrainian intelligence on October 24. The Kremlin likely views repelling Ukrainian forces from their salient in Kursk Oblast without disrupting other high-priority offensive efforts in Ukraine as an operational-level priority in the immediate term and coming months. Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief General Oleksandr Syrskyi stated that Russia deployed nearly 50,000 personnel from other areas of the theater to Kursk Oblast between August and early October, meaning that Russia has had to weaken other areas of the front in order to re-allocate troops to Kursk. Deploying some portion of the North Korean personnel to Kursk could allow the Russian command to re-allocate Russian personnel back to Ukraine, both to support ongoing offensive operations in Ukraine's east, and to sustain defensive efforts in the north and south. It could alternatively let the Kremlin avoid drawing additional high-quality Russian troops from ongoing offensive efforts in Ukraine. North Korean personnel are unlikely to deploy directly into Ukraine until the Kremlin deems that it has properly responded to the Kursk incursion, both because of the current priority the Kremlin is assigning to regaining its territory and because keeping North Korean troops on Russian soil gives Moscow greater control over the informational effects of using them.

**North Korea Deploys Troops to Russia for Ukraine War**
North Korea has sent a deputy chief of staff, Kim Yong Bok, to Russia, along with soldiers, to participate in the war in Ukraine. The soldiers are all under 20 years old and have undergone basic training in the 'Storm Corps'. The head of the North Korean foreign ministry, Choe Son Hui, has arrived in Moscow to negotiate with the Kremlin for additional troops to be sent to Russia. According to the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS), Kim Yong Bok is approaching the front line, but it is unclear how many soldiers from the 'Storm Corps' are accompanying him. The NIS has described this move as 'inevitable' and highlighted the top official's enthusiasm for participating in the war. Kim Yong Bok has compared himself to the KN-23 ballistic missile, which must appear on the front line first. 'I will go there first,' he said, according to the NIS. The NIS has warned that the soldiers, who are all under 20 years old, have undergone basic training and should not be underestimated. 'They have already undergone basic combat training, which they must undergo as 'Storm Corps', so we should never underestimate their combat ability,' the NIS analysts said. The NIS has also noted that the North Korean military personnel are studying Russian military terminology, including the 100 main commands. However, the NIS has expressed concerns about the language barrier. 'We are checking the possibility of deploying North Korean personnel, including high-ranking military officers, to the front line,' the NIS said. Meanwhile, Russian security forces have arrived in Pyongyang, according to the NIS. They arrived in the North Korean capital on special flights from Moscow on October 23-24. The purpose of the visit is to participate in the 'deployment of North Korean troops.' According to the NIS, the deployment will last until December 2024 and is expected to involve around 10,900 soldiers.

**North Korean Troops Imminent Deployment in Ukraine: Zelensky Announces Escalation**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that his military has received information about the imminent deployment of North Korean soldiers alongside Russian forces on the Ukrainian front. According to Zelensky, the first contingents of North Korean soldiers could enter into action as early as this Sunday or Monday. The announcement intensifies concerns about the evolution of the conflict and represents a significant escalation of external involvement in support of Russia. 'This escalation is a clear response to Moscow's denials, which are trying to keep secret their growing dependence on external allies,' Zelensky said. The North Korean intervention represents an expansion of the conflict and raises alarms around the world. Zelensky urged international leaders to respond firmly and to put pressure on both Moscow and Pyongyang, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, to prevent this crisis from escalating further. 'The actual involvement of North Korea in combat cannot be met with indifference, but with concrete actions aimed at safeguarding global stability,' he declared. The Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR) corroborated Zelensky's statements, indicating that they have intercepted military communications from Russia that confirm the coordination between Moscow and North Korean troops. The intercepts suggest that Russia plans to assign translators and logistical support to North Korean units, hypothesizing that each group of 30 North Korean soldiers will be assisted by three Russian military personnel to facilitate operations. The presence of over 12,000 North Korean soldiers, including 500 officers and three generals, highlights the scope of Pyongyang's commitment to the war. The United States has condemned the deployment of North Korean troops, warning that every North Korean soldier deployed in Ukraine will be considered a legitimate military target. 'If they fight against Ukraine, they will become targets. The Ukrainian army will defend itself against them just as it is doing against Russian soldiers,' said John Kirby, spokesperson for the US National Security Council. The NATO has also expressed strong concern, defining the possible intervention of North Korea as a 'grave escalation' of the conflict. The alliance has warned that such a move could have serious international consequences, with the risk of expanding the war's scope beyond European borders.

**North Korean Troops Deployment to Ukraine: A Dangerous Escalation**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenski has warned that North Korean soldiers will be deployed to the front lines in the next few hours. According to Ukrainian intelligence, 3,000 North Korean soldiers, trained in Russian camps, will be sent to fight in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces control part of the Russian territory. Zelenski described this as an 'obvious escalation' by Russia, and called for a 'clear reaction' from the international community: 'The world needs to see clearly what Russia really wants, which is the continuation of the war.' Miguel Ángel Benedicto, a professor of International Relations at the Complutense University of Madrid, believes that this move by Russia is 'a dangerous step, because it strengthens one of the two power axes, and having two sides is what usually happens before a global conflict.' Antonio Herrera, a retired military officer and professor of the Master's degree in Peace, Defense, and International Security at the European University, agrees that 'the most important thing about this new move is the risk of a global war. It's clear that we're moving to an escalation of tension that could lead to a wider war.' Herrera notes that Vladimir Putin visited Pyongyang in June to sign a bilateral security agreement (Strategic Integral Association Treaty) with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Although North Korea had already begun supporting Russia with arms and ammunition, the deployment of soldiers is the next step, linked to an agreement that requires both powers to provide mutual assistance in case one of them is attacked, a scenario that opened up after Ukraine's incursions into Russian regions of Belgorod and Kursk. According to South Korean intelligence, Pyongyang has committed to sending up to 12,000 soldiers to the war in Ukraine, with Russia paying around $2,000 per soldier, in addition to agreeing to help perfect and strengthen North Korea's missile program. Herrera believes that the 3,000 men arrive at a good time for Russia, 'where the population is already starting to wonder where the country is headed in relation to Ukraine. It's already three years of conflict, and although there's a lot of disinformation, Russia has lost between 130,000 and 200,000 men. So, it needs personnel, as well as arms,' explains this military officer who participated in a five-year intelligence mission in Eastern European countries, including Ukraine. 'Even 12,000 men can be a small, symbolic thing, but it's an important thing.' In the short term, it solves the current internal problem for Russia, he says, but it may be just the tip of the iceberg, and that in 2025 this collaboration could increase. 'We're talking about a country with an army of 1.3 million soldiers and 7 million more in reserve. Its mandatory military service is 8 to 10 years. It's a completely militarized country.' Miguel Ángel Benedicto adds that he doesn't think '3,000 or 12,000 soldiers' will change the course of the war in Ukraine, but says that the step taken by Russia of adding Korea to the conflict 'adds fuel to the fire, and this time a trunk is very powerful. Korea has one of the most powerful armies,' he acknowledges. However, for Benedicto, the most relevant thing is that with this strategic move by Russia and Korea, the two axes of alliances are beginning to take shape, two sides, 'and that's what usually happens before a global conflict.' The professor believes that now the axis that forms 'Russia, Iran, North Korea, and a little behind all of them, China' is strengthened, which would be facing 'the EU, the US, that is, the West' that supports Ukraine. In his opinion, that these two axes are already positioning themselves in a live conflict 'is dangerous because you never know where the spark can come from, what can trigger a global conflict.' The same intention is intuited by Herrera to Russia. He says that 'it's sending signals that it's going to try to reach agreements with other countries to fight against the West. That fundamental idea of this mission,' he adds. The experts consulted by 20minutos do not consider it far-fetched that the conflict could be transferred from Eastern Europe to Asia. They explain that the fact that North Korea is militarily supporting Russia could mean that South Korea is seriously considering exporting arms to Ukraine. The Asian country has already suggested this and President Zelenski would be in need of it, with his European and American partners in a moment of lack of unity regarding increasing their military aid. Herrera believes that Kim Jong Un's participation in Ukraine allows him to test his military capabilities in a real way. 'North Korea is a state ready for action, but it hasn't carried out a military activity for years, this allows it to enter into operations and test its long-range missiles.' Something that has put South Korea on immediate alert, which has accused its northern neighbor of preparing for a possible transfrontier conflict. Benedicto says that it's still unclear what China thinks about all this and believes that the next natural step will be to see how the US, in the face of the Russian-Korean alliance, tightens ties with South Korea and Japan 'as a measure of containment of a possible global conflict.'

**Zelensky: Russia Prepares to Deploy North Korean Troops in Ukraine**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday that Russia is preparing to deploy North Korean troops to the battlefield in Ukraine before the middle of next week. According to a senior official in the Ukrainian presidential office, Zelensky has canceled a planned visit by UN Secretary-General António Guterres to Kiev. Western officials have warned that such a development would escalate the ongoing war since February 2022, and would have far-reaching geopolitical consequences that could extend to the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Zelensky stated through the Telegram app that the deployment of North Korean troops would be 'a clear escalatory step by Russia.' He did not provide further details, such as the regions where the North Korean soldiers might be sent. The deployment of North Korean troops under a military agreement between Moscow and Pyongyang would introduce a new dimension to the conflict, which is the largest war Europe has seen since World War II, and has already claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people on both sides, including many civilians.

**North Korean Troops Deployed to Russia to Aid in War Against Ukraine**
North Korean troops have been sent to Russia to aid in the war against Ukraine, according to Ukrainian intelligence. The troops, who have undergone military training in eastern Russia, have been deployed to the Kursk region. The move has been confirmed by the US, NATO, and South Korean intelligence. The North Korean soldiers will be equipped with Russian gear and will be paid around $2,000 per month, although it is unclear how much of this money will actually reach the soldiers. The deployment of North Korean troops is seen as a sign of Russia's desperation in the war, with the US and other countries warning that it will only lead to further losses for Russia. The South Korean government has expressed concern over the deployment, with President Yoon Suk-yeol stating that it is a 'provocation that threatens global security' and that South Korea will take necessary measures to ensure its own security. South Korea is considering sending its own military personnel to Ukraine in response to the deployment of North Korean troops. The move is seen as a significant escalation of the conflict, with the North Korean troops potentially being used as 'cannon fodder' on the battlefield. The US has warned that the deployment of North Korean troops will only lead to further losses for Russia, with the US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, stating that 'if these troops are sent to fight in Ukraine, it will be a significant support to North Korea's illegal war against Ukraine and another sign of significant losses for Russia on the battlefield'. The deployment of North Korean troops is also seen as a sign of the desperation of the North Korean regime, which is seeking to gain access to advanced military technology and to gain experience in real combat. The South Korean government has expressed concern over the potential consequences of the deployment, with the country's defense minister, Lee Jong-sup, stating that 'if North Korea sends special forces to fight in Ukraine as part of the Russia-North Korea cooperation, we will support Ukraine step by step and also consider taking necessary measures to ensure the security of the Korean Peninsula'. The deployment of North Korean troops is a significant development in the conflict, and it remains to be seen how it will play out in the coming weeks and months.

**Zelensky Expects North Korean Soldiers to be Deployed Against Ukraine as Early as Sunday**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expects North Korean soldiers to be deployed against Ukraine as early as Sunday, according to reports from Western intelligence agencies. 'Our intelligence services indicate that Russia will deploy the first North Korean military personnel on October 27 and 28 in combat zones,' Zelensky said in online services on Friday. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed concern and warned that such support from North Korea for Russia would escalate the situation further. Zelensky urged the international community to put 'tangible pressure' on Pyongyang. The Ukrainian military intelligence agency reported on Thursday that the first units of the North Korean army had arrived in the Russian border region of Kursk, where Ukraine launched a counteroffensive in August. The US and NATO confirmed on Wednesday that North Korean soldiers were stationed in Russia. South Korea's intelligence agency previously reported that a total of 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been relocated to eastern Russia, where they would participate in training before being sent to the front in Ukraine. According to estimates from Seoul, Pyongyang could send up to 12,000 soldiers. Scholz called the development 'very alarming' during a visit to India on Friday, saying 'This is bad and, of course, it escalates the situation.' He added that it shows that Russian President Vladimir Putin is 'in great need' and that this is another reason to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia and to seek 'a just and fair peace for Ukraine' together with Kyiv.

**South Korea Considers Sending Personnel to Ukraine to Monitor North Korean Troops**
South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor the activities of North Korean soldiers who are allegedly being deployed in support of Russia. According to Yonhap, a South Korean government source said, 'There is a possibility that personnel will be sent to Ukraine to observe the tactics and combat capabilities of North Korean special forces deployed alongside Russia.' Despite North Korea's denials, the Washington Post reports that thousands of North Korean soldiers are currently training in Russia and could be deployed in Ukraine by the end of the year. Additionally, an unspecified number of Kim's officials are already present in occupied Ukrainian territories to observe and study the battlefield. South Korea has recently summoned the Russian ambassador, Georgiy Zinoviev, to demand the immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops, which intelligence suggests have already arrived in Russia for training and deployment. Zinoviev has promised to report the concerns, but emphasized that cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang is carried out 'in accordance with international law.' South Korea is now evaluating all available options, including strengthening cooperation with NATO, as emerged from a recent meeting between President Yoon Suk Yeol and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. The possibility of South Korea sending personnel directly to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops would further strain relations with Moscow. The US and its allies have expressed strong concerns about the potential escalation of the conflict, calling the move 'dangerous and deeply troubling.' The US is consulting with its partners to assess the implications of this potential 'turn' in the war. South Korea and the UK have warned that Moscow will pay a high price for this military alliance with Pyongyang. South Korea's intelligence agency has revealed that North Korea has already sent 1,500 special forces to the Russian Far East, where they are completing a period of training and acclimation in local military bases, in preparation for potential deployment in combat.

Seoul is also considering providing defensive and lethal weapons to Ukraine, and has condemned North Korea's alleged troop deployment, warning of 'phased countermeasures' with the international community. The US has expressed concern about North Korea's plans, with Ambassador Robert Wood calling it a 'dangerous and highly concerning' step in Russian-North Korean military ties.

**North Korea Deploys Troops to Russia for Ukraine Conflict**
South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) has released satellite images showing the arrival and training of thousands of North Korean soldiers in Russia, in an operation that could escalate the internationalization of the conflict in Ukraine. According to the NIS, Russia began transporting North Korean troops by ship on October 8, with four Russian naval vessels carrying around 1,500 special forces soldiers from the North Korean ports of Chongjin, Hamhung, and Musudan to Vladivostok. The NIS estimates that Pyongyang plans to send at least 12,000 combatants. A video released by Ukrainian authorities appears to show North Korean soldiers receiving packages at a Russian training center. While Russia has denied the arrival of foreign troops on its soil, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had previously stated that his intelligence services had detected the deployment of North Korean personnel and officers in Ukraine. The US has not confirmed these movements, but if true, it would mark a dangerous escalation in Russia's war against Ukraine, according to Sean Savett, a spokesperson for the US National Security Council. Since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, no other country has officially deployed its troops alongside Russia's. North Korea had previously supplied Russia with munitions, rockets, and missiles. The two nations signed a new strategic partnership treaty in June, which includes mutual defense obligations in case of an attack on either country. 'Since the war has moved onto Russian territory, Moscow can invoke this clause of the treaty,' explains Jenny Town, a researcher at the Stimson Center. North Korea may see it as an opportunity to strengthen its relationship with Russia, which could provide it with access to advanced military technologies and combat experience for its officers. The regime may also expect to receive significant financial rewards for its soldiers' participation in the conflict. 'If it's true, it would be a significant development in the conflict,' said Sean Savett. 'It would be a dangerous escalation and would likely lead to further international condemnation of Russia's actions.'

**North Korea Deploys Troops to Ukraine, Escalating the Conflict**
The war in Ukraine is on the verge of a new escalation with the direct involvement of a third country, North Korea, which could lead to an unprecedented escalation since the Russian invasion in February 2022. According to the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS), Pyongyang has decided to send 'important troops' to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine. A total of 12,000 North Korean soldiers from four brigades, including special forces, are expected to be deployed. The NIS reported that 1,500 soldiers have already arrived in Russia, transported by Russian warships between October 8 and 13. They will be stationed in military bases in the Far East, including Vladivostok, Oussouriisk, Khabarovsk, and Blagovechtchensk, and will join the front lines after their training. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that he has received information from Ukrainian intelligence services that North Korea has sent tactical personnel and officers to Ukraine, and is preparing to deploy 10,000 soldiers on its soil. 'This is the first step towards a world war,' Zelensky warned. The Russian government has dismissed the report as 'fake news.' Ukrainian military intelligence chief General Kyrylo Boudanov said that the 10,000 North Korean soldiers currently training in Russia will be ready for combat by November 1. They will use Russian equipment and ammunition, and 2,600 of the first soldiers will be sent to the Koursk region, where Ukrainian troops have occupied approximately 1,000 km² since their offensive on August 6.

**North Korean Soldiers to Fight in Ukraine War: A New Dimension**
North Korean soldiers are being sent to Russia to fight alongside Russian forces in the Ukraine war, according to reports from the Ukrainian government and the Washington Post. This development is seen as a new dimension in the war, as a third country is now directly involved with its own troops. The North Korean soldiers are reportedly being prepared for deployment in Ukraine, with some expected to arrive as early as January 2025. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said, 'We see that the alliance between Russia and regimes like North Korea is getting stronger. It's not just about transferring weapons, but also about transferring people.' The North Korean soldiers will bring two benefits to the Russian army: their military equipment is partly outdated and similar to that used by the Russian army, and they are constantly trained and active in the military. However, there are also risks involved, such as language barriers and the fact that the soldiers will be far from home, fighting in a foreign war.

**North Korea's Army May Soon Be Deployed in Ukraine**
The Russian State Duma will ratify a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement with North Korea today, which was initiated by President Vladimir Putin. The agreement includes 23 points, including joint military and economic assistance in case of aggression, cooperation in various fields such as trade, energy, and security, and joint efforts to combat international terrorism. The agreement is a result of Putin's visit to North Korea in June. The first point of the agreement may already be implemented, as Ukraine's invasion of the Kursk region is underway. The North Korean army, one of the largest in the world (1.2 million people), may receive training in the most challenging and modern conflict of the 21st century. 'I hope the Koreans will indeed appear on the front lines. Let's see what they are capable of, but I think they will be able to do a lot... And it would be nice to have heavy artillery, it won't be superfluous. We've already tried shells, and ours are better,' writes a Russian soldier in a Telegram channel. Russia has found more reliable and trustworthy allies in North Korea than in Ukraine. Pyongyang has always supported Moscow in the UN, supplies ammunition (possibly a million shots per year), including rockets, so it's natural to welcome the strengthening of ties between Russia and North Korea. The agreements between Russia and North Korea are coordinated with China, and Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belyaninov is currently in Beijing to discuss the details. Next, he will be in Pyongyang. Behind such agreements (a similar one is being prepared with Iran) lies a lot of work by Russia and China to create a military alliance against NATO, which is strengthening in the Asia-Pacific region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky could not resist the opportunity to ask the West to increase support for Ukraine, but nothing will happen in this regard until the inauguration of the new US president in January. Moscow has struck at the right moment, and Ukrainians are panicking on social media. They even discovered a base of the Korean army in the DNR. It is likely that this is a vanguard unit, as there have been no reports of the movement of personnel. In fact, Korean soldiers should be very well-trained and ideologically prepared fighters. 'Let us defend the headquarters of the revolution led by the great comrade Kim Jong-il at the cost of our lives!' reads the slogan on the flag of the Korean People's Army Navy, which appeared when Kim Jong-il was in power. The UN Security Council has been imposing sanctions on North Korea since the 2000s to slow down its nuclear program. Russia has approved and followed these sanctions until March 2024, when it vetoed the work of the sanctions group. It is expected that Russia's permanent representative to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, will raise the issue and vote against anti-North Korean sanctions at one of the next sessions.

**North Korean Soldiers Deployed to Ukraine to Help Russia**
There are reports that North Korean soldiers are being deployed to Ukraine to help Russia. According to Ukrainian intelligence sources, a group of North Korean military officers were killed in a missile attack by Ukraine in the Donbas region on October 3. The attack was reportedly carried out by Ukraine in response to Russia's occupation of the region. The sources also claim that the North Korean soldiers were in Ukraine to share their experience with Russian forces. This is not the first time that there have been reports of North Korean soldiers being deployed to Ukraine. In 2023, there were reports that North Korea had sent a group of military engineers to Ukraine to help Russia. However, Russia denied these reports. In June 2024, Russia and North Korea signed a military cooperation agreement, which includes the exchange of military personnel. The agreement was signed during a visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to North Korea. The agreement includes the exchange of military personnel, including engineers and builders. The North Korean military has a large number of engineers and builders who could be deployed to Ukraine. The North Korean military has a universal military service, which includes women, and the service is mandatory for all citizens. The service lasts for 3 to 10 years, depending on the unit. In 2018, the International Institute for Strategic Studies reported that the North Korean military had around 12 million personnel, making it the fourth-largest military in the world. However, the actual number of personnel may be higher. Andrei Gubin, a military expert at the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, estimates that the North Korean military has around 8.5 million personnel, with around 6 million of them being combat-ready. The North Korean military also has a large number of reserve personnel, with around 40 million people being eligible for reserve duty. The North Korean military has a complex structure, with a large number of units and a complex chain of command. The military is also heavily dependent on Soviet-era technology, which may not be compatible with modern Russian military systems. The North Korean military has a limited ability to operate independently, and may require significant support from Russia to operate effectively in Ukraine. However, the North Korean military has a large number of personnel who could be deployed to Ukraine, and the country's military cooperation agreement with Russia could provide a framework for the deployment of North Korean soldiers to Ukraine.

**North Korean Troops May Be Deployed in Ukraine: Expert's Warning**
Military expert Alexander Kovalenko from the 'Informational Resistance' group believes that North Korean units may be deployed in the rear or border zone of the Russian-occupied territory. Kovalenko notes that, according to preliminary information, 20 North Korean soldiers, including 6 officers, were killed in a recent strike on Russian positions. They were likely serving as instructors for the operation and launch of North Korean KN-23 rockets. Kovalenko adds that Putin's need for human resources remains a priority, and the Russian occupation forces will be 'hypertrophied with human resources' in the coming months and in 2025, possibly including North Korean soldiers. The expert suggests that due to the language barrier, North Korean units may be deployed in the rear or border zone to relieve, for example, the Kursk or Belgorod group, or on temporarily occupied territories to perform tasks in the rear. However, Kovalenko notes that the urgent need for personnel may force the deployment of these forces on the front line, but only in specific locations where they are the only ones capable of performing the tasks. Kovalenko emphasizes that North Korean soldiers have not yet been verified as full-fledged combat formations in the Russian occupation forces. He warns that if this happens, international partners should reassess their approaches and attitudes towards the war in Ukraine, where the Ukrainian people are not only facing the totalitarian regime of Putin but also Kim Jong-un. Direct military intervention by North Korea in the war in Ukraine would not only pose a threat to our country but also challenge the entire civilized world...'

**Thousands of North Korean soldiers set to be deployed in Ukraine this year**
According to a Ukrainian military intelligence official, several thousand North Korean infantry personnel are training within Russia. They may be deployed to the frontline in Ukraine by the end of 2024 or to Russian border areas to free up Russian 'reserves' to fight within Ukraine. This would be the first time a foreign government has sent troops in uniform to support Moscow's war in Ukraine.

**North Korean Soldiers Training in Russia May Be Deployed to Ukraine by End of 2024**
According to The Washington Post, citing an unnamed Ukrainian military intelligence officer, thousands of North Korean soldiers are currently training in Russia and may be deployed to the front lines in Ukraine by the end of 2024. The officer stated that North Korean officers are already present in temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories, observing Russian forces and studying the battlefield, but Kiev has not yet seen any North Korean units fighting. The officer also noted that it is unclear where exactly Russia will deploy the North Korean combat units, but they may be used in Russia's border regions to free up Russian troops for combat in Ukraine. 'This could have a significant impact, especially if it's about releasing reserves on Russian territory,' the officer said. South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun described the reports as 'very likely' and stated that Seoul expects Pyongyang to send more personnel to support Russian military efforts. 'Russia and North Korea have an agreement that is essentially a military alliance, so it's very likely that North Korea will send additional troops. We assess it this way and will certainly prepare for it,' the minister said. In September, the head of the Ukrainian military intelligence, Budanov, reported that North Korea is supplying Russia with 'crazy amounts' of artillery ammunition, which is critical for Russia and directly affects the intensity of combat operations. Ukraine is tracking the entire supply chain of these shipments, but has not yet been able to counter it.

**North Korean Troops May Be Deployed to Ukraine by End of 2024, According to ISW**
According to the head of Ukrainian intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, thousands of North Korean soldiers are currently training in Russia and may be deployed to the front lines in Ukraine by the end of 2024. This could provide additional support for Russia's priority offensive operations in Ukraine. Ukrainian and South Korean officials have also suggested that North Korean forces may be operating in occupied parts of Donetsk. Researchers note that the size of the North Korean force that Russia could deploy is unknown, but it could contribute to Russia's efforts to direct additional forces to priority offensive operations in Ukraine and continue the culmination of Russia's summer 2024 offensive.

**Thousands of North Korean Soldiers Training in Russia May Be Deployed to Ukraine, ISW Says**
According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), thousands of North Korean soldiers are training in Russia and may be deployed to Ukraine. Ukrainian intelligence reports that North Korean officers are already present on occupied territories. A Ukrainian military intelligence representative stated that some North Korean officers are observing Russian military actions and analyzing the situation on occupied territories, but Ukraine has not yet detected the presence of North Korean units directly participating in combat. The representative added that 'a few thousand' North Korean infantrymen are undergoing training in Russia, and that the Russian military command may deploy them to the front line in Ukraine by the end of 2024 or to border regions of Russia to free up Russian 'reserves' for combat in Ukraine. North Korean military personnel are likely operating in the occupied Donetsk region. Analysts note that a recent rocket attack near Donetsk resulted in the deaths of several North Korean officers. 'The scale of the North Korean force that Russia may deploy to the front line or use to free up Russian forces along the border is unclear, but these scenarios could also support Russia's efforts to bring additional forces to bear on its priority offensive operations in Ukraine and continue the culmination of Russia's summer 2024 offensive,' the ISW said.

**North Korean Troops Being Trained in Russia May Be Deployed to Ukraine**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reports that thousands of North Korean soldiers are being trained in Russia and may be deployed to Ukraine. According to ISW, Ukrainian and South Korean officials have confirmed that North Korean soldiers are already fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. A Ukrainian military intelligence representative stated that individual North Korean officers are observing Russian forces and studying the battlefield in occupied Ukrainian territories, but Ukraine has not yet seen North Korean units operating in the country. 'A Ukrainian official added that 'thousands' of North Korean infantrymen are being trained in Russia, and that the Russian military command may deploy them to the front lines in Ukraine by the end of 2024 or to border regions of Russia to free up Russian 'reserves' for combat operations in Ukraine,' ISW writes.

The deployment of North Korean troops by Russia may create opportunities for their use in Ukraine, depending on the quality, structure, deployment, and operational compatibility of North Korean forces. In June, it was reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement, which includes mutual assistance in case of aggression against one of the two countries. South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik stated that North Korea's munitions factories are operating at full capacity to supply arms to Russia. US officials have confirmed satellite imagery showing that North Korea has supplied over a thousand containers of ammunition to Russia.
