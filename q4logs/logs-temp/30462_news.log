**Here's what the housing market will look like in 2025**
Zillow predicts a more active housing market in 2025 with more inventory and modest home value growth. According to Skylar Olsen, Zillow's chief economist, 'Buying a home in 2024 was surprisingly competitive given how high the affordability hurdle became. More inventory should shake loose in 2025, giving buyers a bit more room to breathe.' Zillow forecasts a 2.6% home value growth in 2025, with 4.3 million existing home sales. However, mortgage rates are expected to be volatile, with potential swings throughout the year. Additionally, Americans are shifting towards smaller homes and renting as a long-term lifestyle, with the term 'cozy' appearing in 35% more listing descriptions in 2024 compared to 2023.

**It’s a better time to be a renter in Denver as rates fall**
The vacancy rate for apartments in the metro Denver area has increased to 11% as of October, according to CoStar. This is roughly double the vacancy rate of a few years ago. As a result, apartment landlords are offering large concessions, including up to eight weeks of free rent, to fill up empty units. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in metro Denver is $1,686 per month, down 2.5% from a year ago. Landlords are also offering perks such as free internet and fresh flower deliveries to attract tenants. However, the good times may be over soon, as the number of apartments being built is way down this year, giving landlords room to raise rents again once they work through the backlog. According to Jeannie Tobin, director of market analytics for Denver at CoStar, 'Now is probably the best deal you’re going to get. It’s setting up for a pretty big recovery by next year and into 2026.'

**Florida Rental Prices Drop 4% Amid Increased Supply**
According to a report, the average cost of rentals in Florida has decreased to USD 2,376 per month between October and November of this year, marking a 4% drop compared to last year, when the average was USD 2,470. The decrease in rentals in Florida is mainly due to an increase in the supply of apartments, driven by the accelerated construction of residential units during the pandemic. As Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, notes, this increase in supply has moderated prices in the market. However, the economist warns that the price drop may not be sustained beyond 2025, as operational, maintenance, and administrative costs of buildings in Miami are increasing, which could limit future reductions in rentals. Although the price drop is welcome, not all tenants are seeing improvements in their purchasing power, as salaries have not grown at the same rate as inflation, forcing many people to cut expenses to cover their housing needs.

**This housing market map shows Zillow’s revised 2025 home price forecast**
Zillow economists have revised their 2025 home price forecast, expecting a 2.9% increase in U.S. home prices between October 2024 and October 2025. They attribute this growth to low inventory, declining mortgage rates, and modest improvements in home sales indicators. However, they also note that modest increases in new listings and high mortgage rates will limit price growth. Zillow expects the strongest home price appreciation to occur in 10 areas, including Atlantic City, NJ (+6.5%), and the weakest in 10 areas, including Lake Charles, LA (-7.8%). Some housing analysts remain skeptical about Florida's housing market, citing increased inventory and declining condo prices.

**Will mortgage rates and home prices go down -2-**
Homeowners may see reduced insurance price hikes in 2025, according to Rick McCathron, president and CEO of Hippo, a home-insurance company. 'Consumers may still see rate increases in 2025, but not to the extent they saw over the last two years,' McCathron said. On the other hand, rent prices are expected to stay stable next year, with wage growth potentially outpacing rent growth, according to Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist at Zillow. Renters in the Sun Belt may see more deals on rentals, while renters in other areas may see higher rent increases. Additionally, high interest rates are causing people to delay buying a home, with the median age of a renter increasing from 33 in 2021 to 42 in 2024.

**Origin Investments' Multilytics®️ Report: Year-Over-Year Class A Multifamily Rent Growth Returns to Historical Levels, Will Continue Positive Trajectory Indefinitely**
Origin Investments' Multilytics report forecasts a 2.4% year-over-year (YOY) increase in national Class A multifamily rent growth by January 2026, driven by a widening supply and demand imbalance. The report predicts that markets such as Colorado Springs, Dallas, Jacksonville, Las Vegas, Orlando, Raleigh, and Tampa will see rent growth between 4.0% and 5.7%. According to David Scherer, co-CEO of Origin Investments, 'We're seeing record delivery of new product, but that tremendous wave of deliveries isn't being replaced. In the absence of the next wave, I see a world where rents continue escalating in the next one, two, three, and maybe even four years.' The report also notes that the pipeline of deliveries is expected to fall precipitously, by 15.2% in 2025 and 53.8% in 2026. By January 2026, all markets will return to positive territory, with seven markets topping 4% and six increasing by at least 3%.

**The Real CPI May Already Be at 2% | Investing.com UK**
The official inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is reported to be around 2%, but this may be inaccurate due to the lagging nature of CPI data. The shelter component of CPI, which accounts for 40% of CPI, has been running at around 5% annually. However, rental prices, as reported by Zillow and Redfin, have not increased for the last year and a half, with the nationwide median asking rent down $53 from its all-time high in 2022. The author suggests that rent prices may start falling as existing home sale listings rise, and if mortgage rates head lower, the number of existing homes for sale will increase, further pressuring rent prices. When the CPI data catches up with reality, the author expects that CPI will run at 2% or even lower.

**Rental Rate Hikes Slow in October, While Annual Growth Continues**
According to the Observed Renter Demand Index from Zillow, renter interest hit a record low in October, with vacancy rates rising to 6.9% and rental concessions reaching a new peak at 37.7%. Despite this, annual rent growth remained steady at 3.3%. Single-family home rents averaged $2,215, a 4.3% increase from last year, while multifamily rents averaged $1,855, a 2.3% increase from last year. As new apartment buildings come onto the market, renters looking to move soon can expect continued high levels of concessions and slow year-over-year rent growth.

**Rentals Increase by 570% Over the Past 4 Years in Turkey**
Rentals have increased by 570% over the past 4 years, despite the introduction of a 25% rent increase cap in 2022. The demand for rentals has increased due to university students' housing needs, marriages, divorces, business purposes, and urban renewal. The imbalance in supply and demand, as well as opportunity price increases, have driven rent increases over the past 4 years. While inflation has increased by 433% over the same period, rent increases have reached 570%. According to real estate experts, approximately 8 million tenants are in the market, with 250,000 new tenants joining each year. However, the difficulty of accessing housing has made it challenging for many to become homeowners. TSKB Gayrimenkul Değerleme General Manager Makbule Yönel Maya said, 'I think the high rent increase rate will start to slow down, but we can expect a real decline in sales prices for a while.' Maya added, 'The pandemic has caused a significant increase in prices, and the amortization period has decreased from 20-25 years to 15-16 years. I think this is a precursor to the slowdown in rent increases we saw in the past two years. I expect the rent increases to calm down, and sales prices will also stabilize.' Gayrimenkul Değerleme Uzmanı Ahmet Büyükduman said, 'Over the past 4 years, inflation has increased by 433%, while rents have increased by 570%. This means that rents have increased by 26% in real terms. The demand for rentals is increasing due to university students' housing needs, marriages, and other factors. The market is growing at a rate of 3% per year, with 250,000 new tenants joining each year. The prices of homes are not accessible, and the monthly payments are high. If the demand continues to increase, prices will rise rapidly. Therefore, I strongly believe that rent increases will be upward, and I expect them to be slightly above inflation.'

Tenants who renew their rent contracts in November will face this 62.02% increase. This rate applies to both residential and commercial properties. The rent increase rate has been affected by the high inflation rate throughout 2024. The high inflation rate has been a critical factor in determining rent increases. The yearly averages and economic fluctuations will have a direct impact on both tenants' and landlords' budgets and economic planning.

**Yozgat Rent Increase Rate Reaches 62.02%: A New Era for Landlords and Tenants**
A new rent increase rate of 62.02% has been determined for November 2024 for both residential and commercial properties in Yozgat. This rate represents the highest possible increase limit for rent agreements between landlords and tenants, and is not legally allowed to exceed this rate. The new rate comes after the previous 25% rent increase limit expired in July 2024, and rent increases will now be calculated based on inflation rates. According to TÜİK data, the Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) increased by 2.88% in October, with a cumulative increase of 39.77% since December 2023. The annual inflation rate reached 48.58%, and the 12-month average inflation rate is 62.02%, which is a critical data point for calculating rent increases. Landlords and tenants in Yozgat are preparing to update their rent agreements based on these new rates. While the rent increases will bring more income to landlords, they will also increase the cost burden for tenants. Real estate experts in Yozgat believe that these rent increases will affect the economic balance of the city and may cause fluctuations in the real estate market. This regulation is important for both new tenants and those with existing rent contracts in Yozgat, especially as winter approaches and expenses increase. The new rent increase rate of 62.02% marks the beginning of a new era for landlords and tenants in Yozgat and across all of Turkey.

**2024 November Rent Increase Rate to be Determined by October Inflation Data**
The expected rent increase for November 2024 will be determined by the TEFE and TÜFE indices. In the past two years, rent increases have been limited to 25%. Now that this policy has ended, everyone is wondering what the new rates will be. The inflation data for October will be announced on November 4, 2024 at 10:00, and this will determine the rent increase for November. Both tenants and landlords will use these data to set new rent prices. The rent increase will be influenced by the monthly and yearly inflation rates. According to the latest data from TÜIK, the consumer price index (TÜFE) has increased by 49.38% annually and 2.97% monthly. This data will directly affect the new rent prices that tenants will have to pay. The expectation is that the rent increase for November will be similar to the 12-month TÜFE rate of 63.47% announced last month. Both tenants and landlords should be careful and follow the inflation data during this process.

**Gen Z Renters Burdened by High Cost of Rent**
A new report by Zillow and StreetEasy found that nearly 60% of Gen Z renters (ages 18-25) spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. This is a significant burden for many young people, with 3 out of 5 Gen Z renters feeling overwhelmed and stressed by the high cost of rent. 'This is something that shouldn't be normal,' said Kenny Lee, senior economist at StreetEasy. The rent is increasing faster than salaries in most US cities, with the worst affected being Gen Z renters in cities like San Diego, Los Angeles, and Sacramento, where the rent burden is over 75%. Cities in Florida are also among the worst, with 70% of Gen Z renters in Orlando, Miami, and Tampa facing a significant rent burden. However, some cities like Austin have seen a decrease in the rent burden, with Gen Z renters spending 50.6% of their income on rent in 2022, down from 69.2% a decade earlier. The situation is slightly better for Gen Z renters compared to millennials at the same age, according to Zillow. In 2012, 60.2% of millennials spent more than 30% of their income on rent, slightly higher than the 58.6% of Gen Z renters in the same situation. Overall, the situation is dire for many renters in the US, with half feeling overwhelmed by housing costs and spending more than 30% of their income on rent. The housing crisis has been a major issue in the US, with both candidates proposing solutions. Kamala Harris suggests building more affordable housing, while Trump's plan is unclear and focuses on reducing immigration.

**Attention Tenants: Rent Increases by 227% in November**
Despite the 2020 rent law being repealed, some tenants are still bound by the previous regulations and will see a 227.13% increase in their rent in November. This means that those who currently pay $150,000 per month will have to pay approximately $490,000. The increase is lower than the 238% rise in October, due to a decrease in the inflation index. Tenant associations are on high alert due to the difficulties tenants face in paying rent, with many families having to cut back on essential expenses to afford housing. According to real estate companies, the compliance rate is around 97%, but the reality is that families are making sacrifices to ensure they have a roof over their heads.

**Renters Face 226% Increase in November Under Rent Law**
Renters who signed a lease under the Rent Law, which updates prices annually through the Rent Index (ICL), which combines inflation and salaries, will see a 226% increase in November. For example, if a renter paid $150,000 per month a year ago, they will now have to pay $489,900 per month for the same apartment until November 2025. According to Consorcio Abierto, a platform that analyzes expenses, the costs of maintenance in buildings in Buenos Aires increased by 3.5% in September and have accumulated a total of 1122.36% this year. Measured annually, contracts have increased by 239.62%. 'These data provide an idea of prices, for example, last month, landlords and tenants had to pay over $200,000 for maintenance expenses,' said the platform. 'The increase in rent is above the 209% inflation rate,' said the platform.

Renters tied to the old 'Ley de Alquileres' will see a 226% increase in November, according to the Índice de Contratos de Locación (ICL). This is one of the last increases under the old law, which was marked by the ICL. Despite the repeal of the law, existing contracts must be respected until their expiration date. For example, if someone started renting on November 1, 2023, and is due for their first annual update, they will see a 226.6% increase. If they were paying $150,000 per month last year, they will now pay $489,900 per month for the same apartment until November 2025. As the old law required an annual price update, the ICL, which combines inflation (IPC) and salaries (RIPTE), is used for the adjustment.

**US Rents Continue to Rise, but at a Slower Pace**
According to Redfin, the average rent in the US increased by 0.6% in September, reaching $1634. This is in line with the trend of the past two years, where prices have remained within a range of $1599 to $1663. However, in 16 of the last 24 months, rents have been even more stable, between $1630 and $1650. Redfin's economist, Sheharyar Bokhari, noted that while rents have remained stable at a national level, the trend could be 'very different' depending on where you live. He explained that in areas with less construction, such as the East Coast and Midwest, rents are rising, while in cities with a high supply of new housing, such as those in the Sun Belt, rents are falling. The cities with the largest increases in rent were in the Midwest and East Coast, with Washington, D.C. experiencing a 12% increase. In contrast, Jacksonville, Florida, saw a 11.3% decrease in rent. Zillow reported that the increase in rent prices has slowed down due to a decrease in demand and an increase in inventory. Property managers are offering more concessions to attract tenants. Zillow estimated that prices will fall as new rentals enter the market. The Biden administration has proposed a law that would limit rent increases to 5% annually for landlords with more than 50 units. This would affect over 20 million rentals in the US. However, the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders have criticized the plan, saying it would infringe on property rights and discourage new construction.
