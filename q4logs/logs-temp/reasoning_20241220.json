    "gpt_reasoning0": "EXTRACTED_PROBABILITIES: [0.7, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05]\n\nGPT's Answer: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 11 days, as today is December 20, 2024, and the question pertains to rainfall in Miami for the entire month of December 2024.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that Miami will likely end up with low precipitation for December. Up until December 14, 2024, Miami had not received measurable rain since November 10, 2024, and historically, December is part of Miami's dry season. Therefore, if the current dry trend continues, the outcome could be '0.30 inches or below'.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome would involve a sudden atmospheric change that brings significant rainfall to Miami. This could happen if a late-season storm system or weather front unexpectedly redirects into the South Florida region, bringing heavy rainfall. Meteorological phenomena such as cold fronts or tropical disturbances, which are occasionally unpredictable, could lead to widespread precipitation, resulting in a higher total rainfall for December.\n\nRationale:\nGiven that December is typically a dry month for Miami, the historical trend supports the notion that the probability of significant rainfall is lower. The current drought conditions and background information point towards limited rainfall. However, forecasters typically keep a moderate probability for unexpected events due to the inherent unpredictability of weather patterns. Hence, while the status quo remains the least change, the possibility of sudden weather developments should not be entirely ruled out.\n\nFinal probabilities:\nOption_A: 0.70\nOption_B: 0.15\nOption_C: 0.10\nOption_N: 0.05\n\n",
    "claude_reasoning0": "EXTRACTED_PROBABILITIES: [0.3, -0.6, -0.9, 0.9]\n\nClaude's Answer: Let me analyze this carefully:\n\n(a) Time until outcome: 11 days remaining in December 2024\n\n(b) Status quo outcome: Currently no measurable rain through December 14, with the area listed as \"Abnormally Dry.\" If this pattern continues, rainfall would be 0.30 inches or below.\n\n(c) Unexpected scenario: The cold front mentioned for December 21-22 could stall over South Florida and combine with tropical moisture, leading to several days of heavy precipitation that could result in much higher than expected rainfall totals (>0.90 inches).\n\nRationale:\n1. Short-term forecasts (next few days) indicate some rain potential with an approaching cold front around December 21-22, but amounts look modest.\n\n2. Multiple sources mention Miami is in its dry season, and La Niña conditions are expected to make it drier than normal.\n\n3. Historical context is important - while December is typically dry, it's very rare to have zero precipitation (hasn't happened since 1968).\n\n4. The area is currently experiencing drought conditions, suggesting atmospheric patterns are not favorable for significant rainfall.\n\n5. However, Florida weather can change rapidly, and a single stalled front or tropical disturbance could quickly bring substantial rainfall.\n\n6. With half the month already passed with no rain, and typically dry conditions expected, lower rainfall amounts are more likely.\n\nGiven these factors, and weighing heavily toward the status quo of dry conditions while maintaining some probability for weather pattern changes, here are my probability estimates:\n\nOption_A: 0.55 (0.30 inches or below)\nOption_B: 0.25 (0.31-0.60 inches)\nOption_C: 0.12 (0.61-0.90 inches)\nOption_D: 0.08 (Greater than 0.90 inches)\n\n",

However, based on the articles, there are suggestions of rain due to several low-pressure systems and potential thunderstorms in the coming days. This suggests an expectation of increased precipitation in the later part of December.\n\n(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: The anticipated low-pressure systems and any potential rain dissipate or shift away from Houston, keeping conditions dry for the remainder of December.\n\n(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A sudden development of a strong storm system or a series of thunderstorms results in a significantly higher amount of rainfall than forecast, raising the monthly total.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\nPercentile 10: 0.50\nPercentile 20: 1.00\nPercentile 40: 2.20\nPercentile 60: 3.00\nPercentile 80: 4.50\nPercentile 90: 5.70\n```\n\n",

However, based on the articles, there are suggestions of rain due to several low-pressure systems and potential thunderstorms in the coming days. This suggests an expectation of increased precipitation in the later part of December.\n\n(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: The anticipated low-pressure systems and any potential rain dissipate or shift away from Houston, keeping conditions dry for the remainder of December.\n\n(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A sudden development of a strong storm system or a series of thunderstorms results in a significantly higher amount of rainfall than forecast, raising the monthly total.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\nPercentile 10: 0.50\nPercentile 20: 1.00\nPercentile 40: 2.20\nPercentile 60: 3.00\nPercentile 80: 4.50\nPercentile 90: 5.70\n```\n\n",
