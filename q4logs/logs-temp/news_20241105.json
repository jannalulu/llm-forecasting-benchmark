Soldiers from the 4th Brigade of the National Guard, 'Force of Freedom', shared footage of the battle. 'FPV drones are not a panacea! You can't rely on birds from the sky to always cover you. It happens differently, and this video is proof,' the soldiers wrote. As of the morning of November 5, 2024, the Ukrainian military had killed 701,650 Russian soldiers. Over the past day, 1,260 more were eliminated.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 10:48 AM\nSource:[ТСН.ua](https://tsn.ua/ukrayina/ubivchiy-tandem-zsu-pokazali-robotu-pihoti-y-operatoriv-bpla-po-okupantah-video-2694372.html)\n\n**Ukrainian Drone Pilots Prove to be a Deadly Force Against Russian Soldiers**\nUkrainian drone pilots, often with a background in gaming, are proving to be a deadly force against Russian soldiers. They use drones to track and kill Russian troops, and their effectiveness has been a significant factor in the war. According to the Wall Street Journal, these pilots have been responsible for eliminating over 300 Russian soldiers, more than double the number of US soldiers killed by the most successful sniper in the Iraq war. The drones are also used to disrupt Russian supply lines and slow their advance. The pilots, who often have no military experience, are able to operate in a more relaxed environment, with some even joking about their actions. However, they take their job seriously and are willing to kill even those who beg for mercy. As one pilot, Dachno, said, 'I'm sure the mothers of Ukrainian children have also cried.' The Ukrainian government is now producing thousands of drones per month, with some costing as little as $500. Russia, on the other hand, is struggling to keep up with the demand for drones and has fewer experienced pilots. The use of drones has become a key factor in the war, and their effectiveness has been a game-changer for the Ukrainian military.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 03:36 AM\nSource:[www.Bluewin.ch](https://www.bluewin.ch/de/news/international/gamer-sind-als-drohnen-piloten-kiews-toedlichste-kampftruppe-2432650.html)\n\n**Shahed-136 Drone Attacks: A Decreasing Success Rate**\nThe number of Shahed-136 drones used by Russia has increased significantly, but the success rate of these attacks has decreased. In January 2024, 334 drones were used, with 90 successful hits. In February, 356 drones were used, with 68 successful hits. The trend continued in March (603/87), April (295/34), May (349/10), June (328/17), July (426/44), and August (789/44). The introduction of 'Herbera' and 'Parody' decoy drones in September led to a significant increase in the number of decoy drones used. By October, 1,917 drones were used, with 86 successful hits.

What will it take for world powers to say ‘enough’?” – Day 391**\nThe Israeli occupation forces have been conducting aerial, ground, and naval bombardment of northern Gaza for 28 consecutive days, resulting in over 1,200 Palestinian deaths. The siege has included blocking supplies of food, water, medicine, and fuel, destroying homes, and attacking hospitals. Save the Children has expressed outrage over the mass slaughter of children in Gaza, with at least 50 children killed in a recent attack. The organization's Regional Director, Jeremy Stoner, said, 'How many times must children in Gaza face mass slaughter? What will it take for world powers to say ‘enough’?' The international community has been urged to intervene to stop the killing of Palestinian children and civilians. The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 44,081, with 69% of the victims being women and children. The UN has warned that Lebanon's cultural heritage is in 'deep peril' due to Israeli attacks. A new Israeli bill seeks to bar Palestinians from running for legislature, and the US has announced new military deployments to the Middle East.

According to local sources, the official, Ali Abduh Al-Sarafi, would lure his victims to a spot overlooking the village, claiming to have seen a treasure there in a dream. He would then ask them to dig, and after they descended, he would strike them on the back of the head with an axe and bury them. He would then steal their phones, guns, and other belongings. The victims were often lured with the promise of a treasure, and the killer would ask them to bring their guns to protect the area. After killing them, he would send a message to their families, claiming to have left the area to fight on the front lines and would not return for several months. The sources stated that the killer had admitted to killing six people in the first few days, including three from the village and three others from outside the area. The victims were all comrades of the killer and had fought alongside him in the militia. There are currently 13 missing persons reports filed with the local police, which are suspected to be linked to the militia's attempts to conceal the victims' identities.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 08:14 PM\nSource:[sahafahh.net](https://arab.sahafahh.net/story/21391783/%D8%B3%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%A8%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%81-%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%81%D8%B0-%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%85)\n\n**Ukrainian Forces Kill Civilians Trying to Flee Chasiv Yar**\nAt least six civilians in Chasiv Yar were killed by a Ukrainian drone strike while attempting to leave the city and head towards Russia. According to the 'Southern Grouping' military, the civilians were trying to escape through a Russian-controlled area. 'The Ukrainian military first shelled them with artillery and mortars, then sent in FPV drones,' said a military source to TASS. The civilians were trying to escape with the help of a radio dropped by a quadcopter, but were later forced to take shelter. Russian soldiers then dropped water and food to the civilians using drones. However, after a Ukrainian drone strike, only one survivor was able to contact the outside world. The civilians were seen carrying white flags. 'The Ukrainian military started shelling them with artillery. The civilians took shelter in a concrete bunker. The enemy, knowing they were unarmed, continued to shell them. Shells and mines were landing close to the bunker. In moments of calm, our soldiers dropped water and food to the bunker via drones. The civilians were being encouraged by radio,' said Alexander Kot, a war correspondent. This is not the first time such a incident has occurred. In August, a similar incident happened in Volchansk, where two civilians were killed by Ukrainian forces after they were seen trying to escape with a white flag. In 2023, two people were killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on a civilian evacuation point in the Kherson region. The governor of the region, Vladimir Saldo, reported that a 33-year-old pregnant woman was among the dead. Two others were injured. Ukrainian forces have been accused of shooting at their own soldiers who try to surrender, according to a coordinator of the Nikopol underground, Sergey Lebedev. He cited his colleagues in saying that such incidents are common in the Rabyntino area in the Zaporizhzhia region. A Russian soldier, known by the call sign 'Topol', reported that Ukrainian forces do not allow surrendered soldiers to be evacuated to a safe area, as their former comrades shoot at them from behind.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 10:32 AM\nSource:[Аргументы и факты](https://aif.ru/politics/world/obstrelyali-mirnyh-shest-chelovek-ubity-v-chasovom-yare-dronami-vsu)\n\n**War Kills More Than Just Soldiers: UN Reports Alarming Rise in Civilian Deaths**\nAccording to the UN, the number of women killed in conflicts in 2023 doubled compared to the previous year, with 4 out of 10 civilian deaths being women and 3 out of 10 being children. The UN denounces 'patriarchal structures' that make peace 'inaccessible'. The UN reports that out of 33,443 civilian deaths in 2023 (a 72% increase from 2022), 4 out of 10 were women, and 3 out of 10 were children. The UN states that the war is not just a military conflict, but a 'terrible chaos' fueled by 'tyrants thirsty for blood' through ethnic conflagrations. The UN concludes that power can drive leaders to madness and totalitarianism. 'The war does not just kill soldiers, it kills civilians, women, and children,' said no one, but the UN's words echo this sentiment.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 27, 2024 07:24 AM\nSource:[SudOuest.fr](https://www.sudouest.fr/societe/la-guerre-ne-tue-pas-que-des-soldats-21929413.php)\n\n**Evening Update: Today's headlines from The Straits Times on Oct 23, 2024**\nToday's top headlines include: a teenager who killed a schoolmate with an axe has lost an appeal against a 16-year jail sentence; COE premiums have dipped across all categories for the first time since June; Singapore's core inflation has risen to 2.8% in September, higher than forecast; robots will be used to paint and plaster walls at half of BTO construction sites from 2025; a 50-year-old man has been charged with murdering a 41-year-old grassroots volunteer in a fatal stabbing in Clementi; and four Singapore bars have made it into the World's 50 Best Bars list, including Jigger & Pony at No. 5.

Eyewitnesses have reported that the robots have exploded in residential areas, killing civilians and destroying homes. The use of these robots is prohibited under international law, as they are considered indiscriminate weapons that cannot be directed or limited to military targets. The situation in northern Gaza is dire, with over 400,000 Palestinians trapped and unable to leave, and the Israeli military not allowing food supplies to enter the area.

The EMOHR stated that the occupation forces have separated the north of Gaza from the city of Gaza, using military vehicles, sandbags, and rubble to block the area. The EMOHR also reported that the occupation forces have used explosive robots to destroy homes and kill civilians, causing widespread damage and loss of life. The EMOHR warned that the use of explosive robots is a war crime under international law, as they are indiscriminate and can cause harm to civilians. A resident of the Gaza Strip described the sound of an explosive robot detonating in his neighborhood, saying 'The explosion was so loud that I had never heard anything like it before. The dust covered the entire area.' The EMOHR documented several instances of the occupation forces using explosive robots to destroy homes and kill civilians. The EMOHR also reported that over 200,000 people are trapped in the north of Gaza, with limited access to food, water, and medical care. The EMOHR warned that those who survive the bombing and shelling will be at risk of dying from hunger or thirst, as the occupation forces have blocked the entry of aid and supplies into the area. The EMOHR also reported that the occupation forces have destroyed and burned bakeries, and have dug up wells, leaving the population without access to clean water. 'The situation is catastrophic,' said the EMOHR. 'The hospitals are overwhelmed, and the medical staff are struggling to provide care to the wounded.' \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 13, 2024 06:49 PM\nSource:[echoroukonline.com](https://www.echoroukonline.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%8A%D9%81%D8%AC%D9%91%D8%B1-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D9%81%D8%AE%D8%AE%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B9-%D8%AF)\n\n**Israel's Use of Exploding Robots in Gaza: A New Form of Mass Killing**\nIsrael has been using 'exploding robots' to carry out mass killings in northern Gaza, according to a Palestinian security source. The source stated that the Israeli army used these robots during their ongoing ground invasion of Gaza, causing significant damage and loss of life. The robots, which are equipped with explosive charges, are able to move between homes and residential areas, controlled remotely by the Israeli army. The source explained that the use of these robots has resulted in the destruction of entire residential blocks, such as in the al-Faluga neighborhood in Gaza City. The source also stated that the Israeli army has been using these robots since May, and that they have been responsible for numerous civilian casualties. The source said, 'These robots have a huge explosive capacity, they can destroy an entire neighborhood.' The use of these robots is part of Israel's ongoing campaign of genocide against the people of Gaza, which has resulted in over 140,000 Palestinian casualties and 10,000 missing persons, as well as widespread destruction and famine. The Israeli government has been ignoring international calls to stop its aggression and has been supported by the US.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 12, 2024 04:37 PM\nSource:[trtarabi.com](https://www.trtarabi.com/now/%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%AF%D9%85-%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%81%D8%AE%D8%AE%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9-18219371)\n\n**10/7, One Year Later**\nThe barbaric attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023, shocked the world, resulting in the brutal slaughter, rape, and torture of 1250 Israeli citizens, and the capture of another 300. The attack, backed by Iran, destabilized Israel politically and economically, displacing over 100,000 citizens and causing widespread destruction in the Gaza Strip. Israel's military response has killed over 40,000 Gazans and left tens of thousands maimed. The attack has also created political fissures in the Western democracies and in Israel, and has upended plans for a treaty among Israel, the U.S., and Saudi Arabia.

The UN has called for a 21-day ceasefire, but Netanyahu maintained that Israel's military operations are justified to defend itself. Other speakers, including Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, criticized Israel's actions, with Golob saying, 'Mr Netanyahu, stop this war now,' and Sharif declaring, 'This is not just a conflict.

The organization has called for an international investigation into the recent hostilities and for Israel and Hezbollah to comply with the laws of war to minimize civilian harm. 'The Israeli military killed hundreds of people in Lebanon in just one day; thousands have been injured and forced to flee from their homes, and hundreds of homes, businesses, and farms have been destroyed,' said Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. 'It is paramount for Israel and Hezbollah to comply with the laws of war to minimize civilian harm.' The Israeli military has struck over 1,600 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, killing 558 people, including 50 children and 94 women, and injuring over 1,835. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Human Rights Watch has also criticized the Israeli military's warnings to civilians, which it says are not 'effective' under the law. The organization has called on Israel's key allies to suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel, given the real risk that they will be used to commit grave abuses.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 12:00 PM\nSource:[Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/25/lebanon-israeli-strikes-kill-hundreds-hostilities-escalate)\n\n**Jon Stewart Criticizes Israel's 'De-escalation Through Escalation' Strategy**\nJon Stewart criticized Israel's 'de-escalation through escalation' strategy, calling it 'cognitive dissonance and language calisthenics.'

Stewart likened this approach to George Orwell's '1984' and Kurt Vonnegut's 'Slaughterhouse-Five.' He also criticized President Joe Biden for claiming that the US is 'tirelessly working' towards a ceasefire in Gaza, while Israel is launching attacks in Lebanon. Stewart exclaimed, 'Wait!

The attacks took place in the towns of Barsalogho and Sanaba in late August, according to reports. In Barsalogho, militants opened fire on hundreds of villagers outside the town and stormed a Protestant church in Sanaba the following day. The victims in Sanaba were members of a Christian Alliance Evangelical church attending a Sunday service. Armed militants tied the hands of 26 Christian men and cut their throats, according to a pastor from the capital, Ouagadougou. The conflict in Burkina Faso escalated notably in 2023, culminating in about 8,000 fatalities. The military controls about 60% of the country, but Islamist groups have repeatedly targeted Christians and churches. Human Rights Watch noted that Islamist groups in Burkina Faso have 'escalated their attacks on civilians, massacring villagers, displaced people, and Christian worshippers.' Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch, said, 'We are witnessing an incredibly concerning surge in Islamist violence in Burkina Faso. The Islamist armed groups' massacres of villagers, worshipers, and displaced people are not only war crimes, but a cruel affront to human decency.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 04:29 AM\nSource:[Christian Today](https://www.christiantoday.com/article/jihadists.slaughter.26.christians.during.worship.service.in.burkina.faso.report/142191.htm)\n\n**Troops kill 159 terrorists, rescue 188 kidnap victims**\nThe Defence Headquarters has announced that troops have killed 159 terrorists, arrested 174 suspects, and rescued 188 kidnapped victims in operations conducted in the last week.

The attack, which killed 37 people and injured 3,000, has sparked a debate about the potential consequences of such actions. Experts believe that the attack was coordinated using digital means, despite the fact that the explosives were delivered through pagers, which have limited energy capacity. The incident has opened up two dimensions of concern: the mass manipulation of wearable communication devices to harm users, and the mass introduction of explosives into consumer goods through global supply chains. This could lead to a 'slippery slope' of further attacks, including the use of nanorobots, atomic, biological, and chemical substances, and the manipulation of mobile phones to turn them into explosives. The article argues that the attack has changed the world and has brought us to a 'sloping plane' where the consequences of such actions are no longer predictable. It calls for a re-evaluation of the ethics of using technology as a weapon and the need for greater regulation of the use of technology in conflict zones. \nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 02:00 PM\nSource:[Telepolis](https://www.telepolis.de/features/Pager-Explosionen-Der-Dammbruch-und-die-Ethik-der-schiefen-Ebene-9935671.html)\n\n**The Unprecedented Massacre: A New War in the Making**\nThe Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu, has taken a decision that has led to the killing of 5,000 people, one by one. This is not a new tactic in warfare, but the decision to carry out a mass slaughter is unprecedented. The fact that it is a mass slaughter, not a chemical attack, but more horrific, is what makes it stand out. The decision-maker remains unknown, but the consequences of their actions are clear. In Gaza, hospitals and refugee camps are filled with the dead and the wounded, and the 'Beger' drone, made in Taiwan, is the instrument of this mass murder. Netanyahu started this war with extreme violence, destroying Gaza and forcing its people to live in a small area, surrounded by poverty, rubble, and death. Those who refused to follow his orders were fired or removed. The war started in southern Lebanon, but soon spread to the Bekaa Valley and then to the entire country, in an attempt to kill as many people as possible, in a blind and senseless manner, as in Gaza. The decision-maker knew the consequences of their actions, and made sure to eliminate any chances of a ceasefire or a deal, which would have allowed the 'hostage team' to be released. This decision has led to a new war, with new goals and new consequences, and the 'Beger' drone is just one of the tools used to carry out this mass murder. The 'resistance' cannot withstand a blow of this magnitude, and has already lost many leaders and thousands of its supporters, who have been forced to flee their homes and villages. The question remains, how will they respond, when, and where? This time, there is no room for mediators to ask for more patience.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 19, 2024 03:00 AM\nSource:[Elaph](https://elaph.com/Web/NewsPapers/2024/09/1548598.html)\n\n**Israeli Military Kills 37 Palestinians in Gaza in Past 24 Hours**\nIn the past 24 hours, the Israeli military has killed 37 Palestinians in various areas of the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian official news agency WAFA.

The team has made significant progress in this area, and the initial results of the project were announced during the American College of Surgeons' 2024 conference in San Francisco. According to Dr. Tami T. Chang, a professor of surgery at the University of California, 'Our results show that microgravity conditions can develop liver tissues with better features and functions compared to those grown on Earth.' The researchers are using induced pluripotent stem cells to create liver tissues in microgravity. These cells are reprogrammed from normal human cells to resemble embryonic cells, allowing them to differentiate into various cell types. In space, these cells aggregate to form liver-like tissues that are smaller and less complex than natural livers. The microgravity environment allows the cells to aggregate freely without external intervention, resulting in more physiologically accurate tissues. The team has developed a bioreactor called 'Tissue Orb' that mimics the natural blood flow in human tissues, containing artificial blood vessels and an automated system for exchanging nutrients. The researchers are also exploring advanced techniques for preserving the developed tissues in space and returning them to Earth. They are working on developing advanced preservation techniques, including 'ultra-high uniform cryopreservation,' which allows for the preservation of tissues at low temperatures without freezing, without affecting their integrity. This technique can extend the shelf life of engineered tissues, enabling their use in various medical applications, including disease modeling, drug testing, and regenerative medicine. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop effective solutions for preserving tissues that can be used again on Earth, with the hope of addressing the acute shortage of available organs for transplantation and providing new insights into liver diseases.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 01, 2024 07:26 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/science/2024/11/1/%d8%aa%d9%86%d9%85%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%83%d8%a8%d8%af-%d9%81%d9%8a-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%81%d8%b6%d8%a7%d8%a1-%d9%84%d8%b2%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%b9%d8%aa%d9%87-%d9%81%d9%8a)\n\n**Science is finding ways to regenerate your heart**\nScientists are making progress in regenerating human organs, including the heart, lungs, and corneas. Researchers at Scripps Research are working on a drug to grow new heart muscle from surviving heart-muscle cells, while another team is developing a therapeutic to induce surviving cardiac cells to multiply. A third approach involves growing new heart muscle in a lab using stem cells, which can then be injected into a damaged heart. According to Dr. Chuck Murry, director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, 'We're built for performance and not repair.' However, scientists are working to overcome this limitation. For example, Dr. Mauro Giacca is developing a therapeutic that uses microRNA to induce surviving cardiac cells to multiply. Dr. Michael Bollong is working on a drug to grow new heart muscle from surviving heart-muscle cells, which has shown promising results in mice and pigs. The goal is to restore function to the organ and normalize the quality of life of the person. 'We all came from a single cell in our mothers' wombs,' says Bollong.

This initiative aims to explore whether microgravity can promote the growth of healthy hepatic tissues, potentially opening the door to the creation of personalized organs for transplantation. The study will use induced pluripotent stem cells, which can be reprogrammed to become different types of tissues, including liver cells. The cells will be nourished in a spherical bioreactor called Tissue Orb, designed to mimic a vascular system, allowing the liver organoids to receive the necessary nutrients and develop vascularized tissues. The experiment will be launched on the ISS in early 2025 and will last for two weeks. The liver organoids will then be preserved in a special solution and returned to Earth for analysis. A second experiment, scheduled for 2026, will focus on a novel method of cryopreservation, which could revolutionize the way tissues are transported and used in medical procedures. This breakthrough could provide a valuable alternative to organ transplants, which currently rely on human donors. The demand for liver transplants is high, with thousands of patients waiting for a compatible liver, but the number of donors is insufficient. If the cultivated tissues prove viable and functional, they could provide a solution to this growing need. Additionally, the possibility of cultivating personalized organs could reduce the risk of rejection and improve transplant outcomes, ultimately improving the quality of life for patients.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 04:45 PM\nSource:[sciencepost.fr](https://sciencepost.fr/astronautes-cultiver-foies-iss/)\n\n**Baba Vanga's 2025 predictions: A year of conflict, discovery, and global shifts**\nBaba Vanga, a Bulgarian mystic known as the 'Nostradamus of the Balkans,' has made predictions for 2025, which include a large-scale conflict in Europe, a 'cyber collapse' targeting global infrastructure, and environmental disasters due to climate shifts.

They have successfully transported pig kidneys from the US to Tirol using a new transportation technology, which allows organs to be preserved for up to 120 hours. The kidneys were transported at temperatures below freezing point and were still functional after 72 hours. According to Gerald Brandacher, a top medic and transplant researcher, 'Organs can be stored and transported for several days outside the body at temperatures below zero without ice forming.' This technology has the potential to revolutionize organ transplantation and increase the donor pool. 'We can now match organs better, use more complex methods to find the best organ for a recipient, and have a perfect match that lasts longer,' said Brandacher. The team used the XT-ViVo solution in combination with the TimeSeal device to preserve the kidneys. This solution prevents the formation of ice crystals and allows for ice-free preservation of organs between 0 and -20 degrees Celsius. The next step is to conduct clinical trials in 2025 and establish the necessary legal frameworks for global organ exchange.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 01:30 PM\nSource:[der Standard](https://www.derstandard.at/story/3000000241963/erstmals-erfolgreicher-organ-transport-aus-den-usa-nach-tirol-unter-null-grad)\n\n**Liver Cells Grown in Space Could Revolutionize Organ Transplants**\nA new study is testing the ability of human liver cells to self-assemble in microgravity conditions on the International Space Station.

The researchers have been studying the processes involved in forming fully functional body tissues from cultures of reprogrammed stem cells for many years. In space, this growth occurs spontaneously, making the process of growing organs much simpler. The bioreactor is fully automated and can maintain the life of stem cells and stimulate the growth of liver tissues and other organs. The researchers have also developed a set of algorithms that maintain the optimal nutrient environment for tissue growth. If the experiment is successful, the researchers will develop systems, including specialized refrigerators, to transport the grown liver to Earth for implantation in patients.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 20, 2024 12:46 AM\nSource:[belta.by](https://belta.by/tech/view/v-ssha-sozdali-bioreaktor-dlja-vyraschivanija-tkanej-pecheni-na-bortu-mks-669484-2024/)\n\n**Scientists to Send Bioreactor to ISS for Liver Tissue Growth**\nAmerican scientists have developed an innovative bioreactor that allows for the automated growth of liver tissue and other complex organs in microgravity conditions. The bioreactor, which includes artificial analogs of blood vessels and complex algorithms for controlling the nutrient medium, will be sent to the International Space Station (ISS) in February 2025. According to research, liver tissue can develop more efficiently in weightlessness, avoiding the difficulties encountered on Earth. The goal is to grow miniature versions of the liver on the ISS, which can perform vital functions such as blood purification. The success of this experiment will be a step towards creating bioimplants that can serve as an alternative to liver transplantation in the future. If successful, scientists plan to develop systems for delivering organs to Earth for subsequent implantation. As Dr. [no quote from the article], the bioreactor is a crucial step in advancing our understanding of tissue growth in space.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 19, 2024 12:24 AM\nSource:[Pravda](https://www.pravda.ru/news/science/2113307-automated-liver-tissue-growth/)\n\n**Ukraine's Quest for Peace: Can the War be Ended by 2025?**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that the war in Ukraine can only be ended with a strong position, repeating his message during his recent visit to European capitals.

The company's technology uses a degradable plastic mesh to create a human artery, which dissolves over two months, allowing the cells to form a blood vessel. The company has already implanted over 500 of its blood vessels in humans and has shown promising results in clinical trials. The lab-grown vessels have been used to treat patients with traumatic injuries, including soldiers in Ukraine, and have shown to be effective in improving blood flow and reducing the need for amputations. Dr. Laura Niklason, chief executive of Humacyte, said, 'This is spare parts for people.' The company is also testing its technology in people undergoing dialysis and those with peripheral artery disease. Dr. Allan Kirk, chairman of the Department of Surgery at Duke University School of Medicine, said, 'The brilliance here is the realization that you don't need to grow the blood vessel, you just need to put the scaffolding down, and the body will do the rest.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 12:36 PM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/science/health/labgrown-blood-vessels-could-soon-become-reality-11729081567781.html)\n\n**Scientists Restore Monkey's Vision with Human Stem Cell 'Patch'**\nScientists have successfully treated a complex case of macular hole in a monkey using a 'patch' made from human stem cells. This is a crucial step towards making retinal transplants grown in the lab a reality, as well as offering a more efficient and practical solution for this type of visual pathology. A team of scientists led by Dr. Michiko Mandai, director of the research center at Kobe Eye Hospital in Japan, reported in a new study published in Stem Cell Reports that laboratory-grown retinal tissue transplants from human stem cells successfully repaired macular holes in a monkey, restoring its vision. This is a key advance in the use of these genetic techniques to treat visual impairments related to the retina. Dr. Mandai stated, 'We confirmed for the first time in a non-human primate model that the transplantation of retinal organoid sheet derived from embryonic tail facilitates the closure of macular holes. Our results suggest that this method could become a practical, safe, and effective treatment option with minimal invasive risks, particularly for more complex cases of macular holes.' Macular holes are small holes that form in the macula, the central part of the retina in the eye, resulting in central vision blur or distortion. Although significant advances have been made in surgical techniques in recent years, refractory cases remain a significant challenge to resolve. In the case of degenerative retinal diseases such as macular holes, cell-based therapy is a promising strategy to restore visual function. However, while retinal transplantation allows for good anatomical results, visual improvement is limited, and peripheral visual field defects cannot be avoided. Mandai and his colleagues sought to overcome these obstacles by transplanting retinal organoid sheets derived from human embryonic stem cells. The intervention allowed for the survival and maturation of the graft and the development of light-detecting retinal cells called photoreceptors. Post-operative tests in the treated monkey revealed improvements in eye fixation and light responses. In this way, laboratory-grown retinal organoids from human stem cells become a new hope for surgical solutions to retinal problems. However, according to an article published in Live Science, there are still two major hurdles to overcome: potential immune rejection problems and the fact that it has not yet been confirmed that connections are formed between the transplanted cells and the original cells.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 09, 2024 12:32 PM\nSource:[diariodemallorca.es](https://www.diariodemallorca.es/tendencias21/2024/10/09/restauran-vision-mono-celulas-madre-109116943.html)\n\n**Revolutionary lab-grown lung tissue set to transform therapies for respiratory diseases and organ transplantation**\nFrontier Bio is developing lab-grown human lung tissue as an alternative to animal testing in preclinical drug development. Their technology uses a mixture of cells, including stem cells, combined with biomaterials and bioprinting hardware to produce tissue geometry. The lab-grown lung models develop bronchioles, alveolar air sacs, and beating cilia, and produce mucus and surfactant found in natural lung tissue. According to Victoria-Elisabeth Gruber, Head of Translational Research at Frontier Bio, 'There is an urgent need for more accurate models of lung tissue that allow us to test new therapeutics more effectively than with current methods.' The technology has broad applications, including studying diseases like lung cancer and COVID-19, and creating tissues and organs for transplantation. As Eric Bennett, CEO of Frontier Bio, noted, 'This could fundamentally change the landscape of lung transplants, giving hope to thousands of patients waiting for lifesaving treatment.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2024 10:03 AM\nSource:[PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/revolutionary-lab-grown-lung-tissue-set-to-transform-therapies-for-respiratory-diseases-and-organ-transplantation-302259035.html)\n\n**Xenotransplantation: A Potential Solution to the Organ Shortage?**\nIn France, 5,634 organ transplants were performed in 2023, a 2.5% increase from the previous year. However, the shortage of organs remains a significant issue, with nearly 11,500 patients on the waiting list and 823 dying due to a lack of a transplant. The xeno-transplantation, or xenograft, which involves replacing a human organ with one from an animal, is being researched as a potential solution. Scientists have made significant progress in this field, particularly with the use of Crispr-Cas9 biotechnology, which allows for the manipulation of living organisms. To overcome the problem of incompatibility between the animal organ and the human immune system, researchers have created 'humanized' pigs by inhibiting certain genes and inserting human genes. These pigs are then used to provide organs for transplantation. The first successful xenotransplantations were performed in 2022 and 2024, with patients receiving a pig heart and kidney, respectively. However, the risks associated with this technology, such as the transmission of animal diseases to humans, are still being evaluated. The economic implications of xenotransplantation, including the high cost of the procedure and the potential threat to the organ donation system, are also being debated. Ultimately, the acceptability of xenotransplantation will depend on the balance between the potential benefits and risks, as well as the social and philosophical implications of this technology.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 30, 2024 12:10 PM\nSource:[La Croix](https://www.la-croix.com/sante/les-xenogreffes-une-solution-acceptable-pour-pallier-la-penurie-d-organes-20240930)\n\n**Xenografts: The Paris Laboratory that the World Envies**\nThe Paris-based laboratory, led by Alexandre Loupy, is a hub for analyzing the risks of rejection in xenotransplantation, where an organ from an animal is transplanted into a human. The team has received biopsies from Richard Slayman, a 62-year-old American who received the first pig kidney transplant at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. 'The immunological barrier between species has long been the obstacle for xenotransplantation,' notes Alexandre Loupy. To overcome this, scientists use technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 to 'humanize' the organ and improve compatibility. Although Slayman died two months after the operation, his doctors said there was 'no indication' that his death was related to the transplant. Since 2021, five patients in a coma have received pig kidney transplants, and two others have received pig heart transplants, but both died shortly after. The French laboratory's work is considered essential to this cutting-edge medicine, and Paris hosted the BANFF 2024 conference, where xenotransplantation data will be included in the next edition. 'In ten or fifteen years, xenotransplantation could solve the global shortage of organs,' predicts Alexandre Loupy. 'In France, we hope to have the necessary authorizations to perform the first operations in 2027.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 29, 2024 08:00 AM\nSource:[Le Point](https://www.lepoint.fr/sciences-nature/xenogreffes-le-laboratoire-que-le-monde-nous-envie-29-09-2024-2571440_1924.php)\n\n**Experts Suggest Using Animal Organs for Human Transplants in the Future**\nExperts are suggesting that in the future, organs from animals could be transplanted into humans. They also believe that artificial intelligence will play a significant role in organ transplants. According to Prof. Dr. Caner Süsal, Director of Koç University's TIREX, the biggest problem in organ transplants is the shortage of available organs. He stated, 'We have approximately 80,000 to 100,000 people waiting for an organ transplant in Turkey, but we can only perform around 3,500 transplants per year. The gap between the two is growing. To address this issue, we are exploring the possibility of using organs from animals. However, this would require genetic modification. It seems like the time has come to apply this to humans as well. We are discussing the latest developments in organ transplants and what we can achieve in the future. We have participants from 13 countries and 5 continents attending this meeting, and we have managed to bring together the most prominent scientists in the field of organ transplants. We plan to breed animals in farms, genetically modify them, and transplant their organs into humans within the next 10-15 years.

Immunotherapy has led to the development of treatments such as vaccinations, antibody therapies for cancers, and CAR-T therapies, where a patient's T-cells are genetically engineered to target specific cancer cells. The human genome project, completed in 2003, has paved the way for the development of new tests and treatments. Stem cell transplantation has been used to treat genetic diseases, and recent approaches aim to correct protein production in patient's own cells using vectors to implant correctly functioning genes. Gene editing technology, such as CRISPR/Cas9, has been developed and has shown promise in treating diseases such as sickle cell disease. Additionally, genetically modified pig organs have been used in transplantation, with the first pig heart transplant attempt in 2022 and the first pig kidney transplant in 2024. While there have been no long-term successes yet, there is hope that this approach will work in the future.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 14, 2024 09:01 AM\nSource:[Milford Daily News](https://eu.milforddailynews.com/story/lifestyle/health-fitness/2024/09/14/dr-jeff-hersh-examines-advancements-cell-gene-therapy-over-25-years/75144196007)\n\n**Scientists Seek to Rejuvenate Brains with Cultivated Tissue**\nA team of scientists, led by Jean Hébert, a renowned biologist, is working on a radical idea to rejuvenate the human brain by replacing aged parts with young tissue grown in a laboratory. This ambitious plan has been funded by the US government's Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), which was established in 2022 to promote transformative innovations in healthcare through massive government funding. Hébert proposes a gradual replacement of the neocortex, the region of the brain responsible for memory and reasoning, without compromising personal identity. He suggests that humans could avoid aging by periodically replacing organs and tissues, like a car's maintenance. Hébert has already conducted preliminary experiments with mice, which have shown promising results. He plans to integrate progressively grown brain tissue into the human brain, starting with small sections. However, the scientific community is divided, with some expressing enthusiasm and others raising concerns about the ethics and feasibility of this approach. Hébert has requested a budget of $110 million to expand his research to larger animals, which he believes is a significant step towards reversing brain aging. While some see this as a potential breakthrough in medicine, others are skeptical about the possibility of fully integrating transplanted brain tissue into an aged brain. The implications of this research are profound, and the debate will likely continue. 'I prefer life to this slow degradation towards non-existence that biology has planned for all of us,' Hébert says. 'We are at a couple of steps away from reversing brain aging,' he adds. 'A couple of big steps, I should say.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 11, 2024 05:04 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/es/cient%C3%ADfico-propone-sustituir-cerebros-envejecidos-por-tejido-joven-cultivado-en-laboratorio/a-70190548)\n\n**The Future of Medicine: Creating Organs in the Lab**\nScientists at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and the Instituto D'Or de Pesquisa e Ensino have been working on reprogramming cells to study mental disorders for over a decade. They have successfully transformed cells into neurons and created mini-brains to study factors that can affect brain function. In one study, they isolated cells from the urine of people with schizophrenia and re-created neurons with the disease to better understand the disorder and develop more effective treatments. The researchers have also created organoids, three-dimensional structures that grow in the lab like a miniature brain. Their analysis indicates that the neurons of people with schizophrenia suffer from greater oxidation. The advancements in mini-brain research have opened up new perspectives for exploring questions related to neurodevelopment, such as autism spectrum disorder, and have the potential to change the lives of patients. Additionally, scientists at the Centro de Pesquisa sobre o Genoma Humano e Células-Tronco, linked to the Universidade de São Paulo (USP), are combining cell reprogramming techniques with 3D printing to create mini-livers. This technique, which has been tested by the team, offers hope that in the future, cells from a person's own body can be reprogrammed to build a new organ in the lab, providing an alternative to waiting for a liver transplant and without the risk of rejection.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 10, 2024 02:27 PM\nSource:[아브릴](https://saude.abril.com.br/medicina/a-criacao-de-orgaos-em-laboratorio-no-futuro-da-medicina)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The study, based on the German Ageing Survey, a representative survey of people over 40, found that people today generally feel older later in life than previous generations. While 65-year-olds today consider themselves old at 75, previous generations set this threshold at 71. Interestingly, the point at which people feel old shifts further back with increasing age. For example, 60-year-olds believe that old age begins at 74, but five years later, at 65, they move this threshold to 75. The study also found that women tend to start feeling old about 2.5 years later than men, which the researchers attribute to women's higher life expectancy and greater social stigma surrounding aging. With better medical care, healthier diets, and more active lifestyles, people are delaying the expectation of when life becomes 'quieter'. Where 65 was once considered the start of retirement and aging, this generation often remains active until 70 or 75. As a growing number of seniors engage in sports, stay digitally connected, and remain mentally active, the actual age becomes less relevant, and the importance of biological and perceived fitness takes center stage, according to Dr. Elin, who said, 'It was a great day.'

The study, led by S. Jay Olshansky, a biostatistician at the University of Illinois in Chicago, analyzed data from the US and eight other countries with high life expectancy. The results suggest that the average lifespan in these countries is approaching a plateau, with no significant progress expected in the coming decades. Olshansky estimates that only 15% of women and 5% of men will live to be 100 years old in this century. However, he emphasizes that this is not a reason for despair, but rather a test of reality. He notes that while many people live to be 85 or 90 years old, few will reach 100. The study has implications for the field of aging research, which will need to develop new and creative strategies to achieve significant increases in human lifespan in the coming decades. Olshansky suggests that personal health choices, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, are crucial for longevity, but also acknowledges that genetic factors play a significant role. He notes that 'when someone says, 'What's the best advice you can give someone to live to 100?' My answer is: choose long-lived parents.' The study also highlights the need for new approaches to aging research, beyond traditional medicine and supplements. Olshansky suggests that the field needs to focus on the process of aging itself, rather than just treating individual diseases. He notes that 'we've created a set of tools in medicine to fight one disease at a time. To make further progress, science 'must take on the process of aging itself.' Future breakthroughs may come from innovations in genetics, reprogramming cells, and other areas of biology. 'Great breakthroughs in technology happen only as a result of many earlier works that have no dramatic consequences until they do,' comments Aubrey de Grey, a researcher on the process of aging. De Grey is working on interventions to 'repair damage' in the aging process and is testing various combinations of stem cell therapy, drugs, and gene therapy in mice that may lead to a breakthrough in human lifespan extension. 'The goal is to gather enough of these solutions to address the current challenges,' he says. Another researcher, Peter Fedichev, is working on a paradigm shift that could help slow down the aging process. His company, Gero, is working with pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, to develop new targets for age-related diseases. 'If we continue to do what we've been doing, we won't find a solution,' Fedichev comments. 'We need to separate the problem of aging from diseases and then put effort into designing new ways to intervene in the aging process.'\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: November 03, 2024 04:11 PM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://businessinsider.com.pl/rozwoj-osobisty/zdrowie/jestesmy-na-plaskowyzu-zycia-co-z-niego-widac/tdpckn0)\n\n**Fondazione del Monte: €5.8 million allocated to projects for the territory in 2025**\nThe Fondazione del Monte di Bologna e Ravenna has released its first Triennial Programmatic Document, outlining its strategy for the next three years.

However, the distribution of care work remains unjustly distributed, with women shouldering the majority of the burden. This means less time for women to work, study, and produce. If we don't address this issue, the problems for providing care will deepen, leading to a severe care crisis with negative implications for gender equity, the well-being of caregivers and those being cared for, and the country's development. The scenario becomes even more critical as the demand for care is changing, and we will need to provide care for older people, who will be increasingly numerous. The cost of not intervening will be paid by all, as the impacts will fall on the healthcare and social protection systems. Contrary to the world's expectations, the 2025 Budget Proposal is far from addressing this issue. The proposal includes a significant cut to policies aimed at strengthening and building care infrastructure for children and older people, with a real decrease of 28% and 46% compared to 2024 and between 41% and 72% compared to the current 2023 budget. Additionally, the budget allocations could fall even further due to the estimated 18.3% inflation rate, compared to the 38.4% projected by the Central Bank's Market Expectations Survey. This cut is part of a larger trend of underfunding, marked by the elimination of a key instrument like the labeling of programs aimed at closing gender gaps and the disarticulation of policies to address the unknown: gender inequalities. Furthermore, the Program for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Older Adults, which promotes progressive care systems, saw a real decrease of 15% compared to 2023 and is currently under-executed, with only around 54% of the allocated funds used by October. The promotion of autonomy in older adults and the provision of adequate infrastructure for basic care is crucial because the global fertility rate has been declining for 10 years, and the population is aging. The estimated proportion of people over 60 years old will increase from 16% in 2022 to 20% in 2040. Moreover, the aging population is feminized, as women live longer than men. The care burden is also feminized, with women dedicating twice as much time as men (6:31 and 3.40 hours per day, respectively) to unpaid domestic and care work. The current situation is urgent, but we also face long-term challenges that we have the opportunity to anticipate. The care agenda will soon undergo significant changes, and many discussions in the coming years will be linked to the demographic transition and the consequent aging of the population. Investing in the care economy and infrastructure, as well as support systems, is a concrete response that has a significant impact on the country's economic development, as it promotes women's participation in the labor market. According to the ILO, investing in the care economy could generate over 1.8 million jobs in Argentina by 2030, mainly for women. In summary, this means an increase in activity and employment rates, which in turn lead to increases in family incomes and impact on the well-being of children and adolescents, who are the most affected by poverty, with 66% of children between 0 and 14 years old living in poor households. Today, more than ever, it is essential to invest, reconvert, and adapt care infrastructure and services to address the population changes that are already occurring. We have an opportunity, but it is now, before the pyramid loses its shape entirely. If we don't take it, who will bear the cost of this blindness?\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[chacoprensa.com](https://chacoprensa.com/2024/10/29/la-poblacion-esta-envejeciendo-y-la-tarea-de-cuidar-necesita-desarrollar-sistemas-solidos-y-resilientes/)\n\n**Promoting Healthy Aging and Combating Ageism through Technology and Intergenerationality**\nThe increasing life expectancy is considered a significant achievement of humanity and one of the most important social transformations of the 21st century. The United Nations General Assembly declared the 'Decade of Healthy Aging' (2021-2030) as the main strategy to build an inclusive society for all ages. This global initiative unites efforts from governments, civil society, professionals, universities, media, and the private sector to improve the lives of older people, their families, and communities. The pillars of this strategy are health, social participation, security/protection, and lifelong learning. As a professor of Occupational Therapy at the University of São Carlos, I have had the opportunity to care for people with physical disabilities and older adults, conducting research and teaching activities in the area of aging. I also follow this theme in my postdoctoral research on older immigrant women. In addition, I developed projects aimed at older adults living in both the community and Long-Term Care Institutions for the Elderly (ILPIs), with occupational therapy actions that included activities with the presence of animals, music, dance, oral history of life, among others. During my work at the Group of Optics at the Institute of Physics of São Carlos (IFSC-USP) - Center for Research in Optics and Photonics (CEPOF) - INCT, coordinated by Prof. Dr. Vanderlei Salvador Bagnato, I participated in interdisciplinary teams. One of the projects developed was the creation of a prototype that combines laser and ultrasound for the treatment of osteoarthritis in the hands and knees. The results showed a significant reduction in pain, improvement in functionality, and quality of life, with several volunteers reporting the resumption of daily activities and the start of new practices. This was an initial step, and other teams also contributed to the advancement of this innovative project. Despite the growth of research on aging and the significant increase in the population of older adults in Brazil, there is still a lack of value and diversity of experiences of life among this group. This scenario is exacerbated by the presence of stereotypes and prejudice against older adults, known as ageism or etarismo, which can result in violence and social exclusion. Promoting tolerance to diversity, treating older adults with respect, and encouraging intergenerationality, knowledge exchange, and conviviality between different ages are important strategies to combat prejudice against older adults. These aspects, combined with access to technological resources, can contribute to a more just and better quality of life society for all.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 03:39 AM\nSource:[saocarlosagora.com.br](https://www.saocarlosagora.com.br/coluna-sca/recursos-tecnologicos-e-acoes-de-cuidado-as-pessoas-idosas/175095/)\n\n**The Zap: latest health and aged care news, plus a comprehensive list of consultations now open**\nThe Australian Government's failure to respond to a Senate inquiry's report on mental health and suicide prevention has been described as 'distressing and disrespectful' by the Australian Association of Psychologists. The report, published in late 2021, included 44 recommendations. The Government has used the passage of time as an excuse not to give a substantive response to the recommendations. The report was delivered in November 2021 and provided meaningful solutions to help ease the mental health crisis, but these have been ignored. The Australian Association of Psychologists has waited almost three years for nothing, calling it an 'absolute waste of time and effort' for all the invested stakeholders. Meanwhile, the midwifery workforce is in crisis, with a report by the Burnet Institute finding that there are not enough midwives or current midwifery students in the pipeline to meet future needs. The report made 32 recommendations, including increasing the number of midwifery students and quarantining places for First Nations students. The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF) has commented on the report, saying that it is imperative that the midwifery profession remains a strong, equipped workforce that reflects the Australian community. The ANMF has identified immediate responses to the crisis as including safe midwifery-specific staffing ratios, flexible rostering, subsidised education, and culturally appropriate trauma-informed care education. Additionally, the Government has announced funding to accelerate the development of a national targeted skin cancer screening roadmap, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics has released updated microdata on sun protection behaviours. The Consumers Health Forum has warned of the risks of using a one-off telehealth consultation to access a particular medicine, and the Grattan Institute's Peter Breadon has explored vaccination rates in residential aged care for COVID-19 and other diseases. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has released data on residential aged care performance indicators for the June 2024 quarter, showing a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of residents experiencing polypharmacy, antipsychotic medication use, and falls that resulted in major injury. However, the proportion of residents experiencing many of these undesirable outcomes remains high. The National Health and Medical Research Council has released for consultation draft updated Australian Drinking Water Guidelines, including new limits for PFAS concentrations. Submissions close on 22 November, and the final guidelines are expected to be released in April next year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[croakey.org](https://www.croakey.org/the-zap-latest-health-and-aged-care-news-plus-a-comprehensive-list-of-consultations-now-open/)\n\n**Gala for Seniors 2024: A Celebration of Active Aging and Human Rights**\nThe annual Gala for Seniors 2024 will take place this Wednesday at 15:00 hours at Parque Cultural de Valparaíso.

The program is set to expand further, with a new campus opening in Batman in November 2024. Students, such as Müzeyyen Can and Abdurrahman Kozankurt, have shared their positive experiences with the program, citing the joy and enrichment it has brought to their lives. 'We are proud to lead such an important project,' said Özkan. 'Aging is a process that requires thought and attention, and we aim to create projects that support healthy aging.' 'True immortality is achieved through the legacy we leave behind,' she added. 'While science has made significant strides in slowing down aging, it remains an unavoidable part of life,' she said.

The city prepared a cultural program for pensioners, as well as opportunities to resolve pressing issues, consult with doctors or lawyers. According to the Department of Social Policy of the Novosibirsk City Hall, 11 people celebrated their 90th birthday, 237 people celebrated their 95th birthday, and 82 people celebrated their 100th birthday in 2024. The number of centenarians is increasing. 'In 2024, 11 people celebrated their 90th birthday, 237 people celebrated their 95th birthday, and 82 people celebrated their 100th birthday,' said the Department of Social Policy. For comparison, in 2023, 44 people celebrated their 100th birthday in Novosibirsk. The city hall has congratulated 49 centenarians as of October 7, 2024. There are also residents of Novosibirsk who are older than 105 years old, such as one woman who celebrated her 105th birthday in February 2024. Women make up the majority of the elderly population in the city. Each centenarian's birthday is a significant event in Novosibirsk, with responsible officials visiting and congratulating them. For example, Ekateryna Yurkevich, a 105-year-old resident of the city, was congratulated by officials in the Lenin district. According to official statistics, there are 35 million people in Russia aged 60 and over, including 4.9 million people aged 80 and over. By 2030, the number of people aged 60 and over is expected to reach 36.5 million, and the number of people aged 80 and over is expected to reach 5.5 million.

According to the United Nations, the aging of the population is transforming social structures worldwide, with the average life expectancy at birth exceeding 75 years in half of the countries. In Uruguay, 16% of the population is over 65 years old, a 14% increase from 2011. By 2030, there will be more adults over 65 than young people worldwide. The UN emphasizes the need to expand opportunities for training and education in geriatrics and gerontology, address the global shortage of caregivers, and recognize the diverse contributions of caregivers. Matilde Fernández Sanz, president of the Observatorio Estatal de la Soledad no Deseada (SoledadES), notes that ageism is a significant issue, with the media often portraying older adults as 'viejecitos frágiles' (fragile old people). She also highlights the importance of creating new social networks and encouraging older adults to participate in cultural activities to combat loneliness. An article in The Conversation notes that the mental health of older adults is particularly vulnerable due to chronic diseases, neurodegenerative and mental disorders, and significant life events such as retirement or the loss of loved ones. In Spain, the frequency of mental health disorders in primary care consultations has increased from 25% in 2016 to 36% in 2021, with anxiety, insomnia, and depression being the most common. The UN recommends reducing risk factors associated with diseases, increasing protective factors through healthy habits and exercise, developing cognitive protection actions, promoting positive attitudes towards life, and fostering social participation.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 01, 2024 11:00 AM\nSource:[El País](https://www.elpais.com.uy/bienestar/vida-sana/envejecer-con-dignidad-el-lema-de-este-dia-internacional-de-las-personas-de-edad-2024)\n\n**Solving the health care dilemma: Why older adults are skipping vital care**\nAs a gerontologist, it is disheartening to see older adults disinterested in routine medical check-ups, refusing to follow doctors' orders or take prescribed medications. According to a March 2024 CDC snapshot poll, one in four older adults report skipping or delaying necessary health care in the past year. Despite medical advancements, a significant portion of the older population remains resistant to proactive health care measures. This resistance not only jeopardizes their health but also poses a broader public health challenge. Factors contributing to health care compliance include socioeconomic status, education, and cultural beliefs. Potential reasons for non-compliance include a lack of trust in the health care system, feeling overwhelmed by modern health care, and a fatalistic attitude towards aging. Addressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach, including rebuilding trust in the health care system, prioritizing culturally competent care, and educational initiatives. Community engagement and peer influence can also play a vital role in promoting health care engagement. As a gerontologist, the goal is for all older adults to live their best lives with happiness and optimal quality of life. By addressing the root causes of resistance and implementing targeted strategies, we can help older adults embrace a proactive approach to their health. 'We have not effectively communicated the importance of preventative care,' says Michael Pessman, a gerontologist. 'Waiting until a problem arises often leads to worse outcomes, exacerbating conditions that could have been managed or prevented with early intervention.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 28, 2024 11:00 AM\nSource:[KevinMD.com](https://www.kevinmd.com/2024/09/solving-the-health-care-dilemma-why-older-adults-are-skipping-vital-care.html)\n\n**Fronditha Care Foundation launched to drive culturally appropriate aged care innovation**\nThe Fronditha Care Foundation was launched on September 25, aiming to improve access to culturally appropriate aged care for Australia's diverse population.

Currently, the retirement age is 60 for men, 50 for blue-collar women, and 55 for white-collar women. The change is expected to take effect on January 1, 2025. Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne's Victoria University, said, 'There are more people reaching retirement age, and the pension fund is under high pressure, so it's time to take it seriously.' The change will be implemented gradually based on an individual's birthdate. For example, a man born in January 1971 can retire in August 2032 at the age of 61 years and 7 months, while a man born in May 1971 can retire in January 2033 at the age of 61 years and 8 months.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: September 13, 2024 08:27 AM\nSource:[Halk TV](https://halktv.com.tr/ekonomi/emeklilik-yasi-erkeklerde-63-kadinlarda-58-oldu-1-ocaktan-itibaren-gecerli-o-869705h)\n\n**China approves plan to raise retirement age from January 2025**\nChina's top legislative body has approved a plan to raise the country's retirement age, starting from January 2025. The retirement age will be raised to 63 years old for men and 58 years old for women in white-collar work, and 55 years old for women in blue-collar work. This change aims to ease pressure on pension budgets and increase the labor force participation rate, helping to mitigate the effects of population aging. According to Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at the Centre of Policy Studies, 'The government must take action. If the population continues to decline, the shrinking of the labor force will accelerate, further negatively impacting economic growth.' Xing Zhaopeng, ANZ's senior China strategist, believes the move will have 'no impact on the short-term economy' but will help maintain stable productivity growth in the long run.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 13, 2024 06:47 AM\nSource:[The Gazette - Colorado Springs](https://gazette.com/news/us-world/china-approves-plan-to-raise-retirement-age-from-january-2025/article_0a1050b5-ca6d-5f0e-8220-fa2c5654e4c6.html)\n\n**Urgent Steps Needed for Asia-Pacific's Ageing Population: Insights from 2024 APRC in Bali**\nThe 2024 Asia-Pacific Regional Conference (APRC) on Population Ageing in Bali has brought together 500 delegates from 38 countries to discuss the region's rapidly aging population. By 2050, almost 20% of the region's populace will be over 60 years old, with the number of older people expected to triple from 2010 to 2050. Pio Smith, Asia-Pacific Regional Director for UNFPA, emphasized the urgency for governments to address this shift, saying, 'No one should be left behind.' The Asian Development Bank (ADB) report highlights the demographic dividend that can be reaped now, but warns that the region's rapid aging places it at the forefront of a significant global demographic trend. Somchai Jitsuchon, a research director at the Thailand Development Research Institute, stressed the importance of preventative care to avoid costly non-communicable diseases, while Cherian Mathews, CEO of HelpAge International, underscored the critical role of civil society in caring for the elderly. 'Living longer comes with a responsibility to take care of ourselves from an early age,' Somchai said. 'Treating such diseases is expensive. Hence, people should start saving early to ensure financial stability in their later years.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2024 09:42 PM\nSource:[thai.news](https://thai.news/news/thailand/urgent-steps-needed-for-asia-pacifics-ageing-population-insights-from-2024-aprc-in-bali)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

He has created and invested in several successful companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink. Musk has also been involved in the acquisition of Twitter, which he purchased for $44 billion in 2022. He has been a frequent commentator on cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Dogecoin, and has invested in several companies, including The Boring Company and xAI. Musk has also been a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, donating nearly $120 million to his 2024 presidential campaign.

Since taking control of Twitter, intervening in the Ukraine war, and dominating the space market, Musk's empire has surpassed the model and changed dimension. Musk's ambition is not financial, but to transform the universe and humanity, even if it means spending everything to achieve it. He has become a rival to the liberal Western order and a threat to the European Union, particularly with his support for Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign. Musk's empire is virtual, with no physical territory, but he has built his own space of sovereignty with his galaxy of satellites, rockets, and social media platform. He is treated with the respect and deference usually reserved for heads of state, and his fortune is estimated to be over $350 billion, which could make him the first billionaire by 2027. Musk's vision is to create a new, all-powerful human being, and he is using his platform to promote his conception of the world and intervene in politics.

    "news": "Here are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Oregonians to Vote on Universal Basic Income, Ranked Choice Voting**\nOregonians will vote on five ballot measures, including Universal Basic Income (UBI) and ranked-choice voting (RCV). The UBI proposal, known as the Oregon People's Rebate, would provide a family of four with $6,400 annually, funded by a 3% tax on corporations with over $25 million in annual sales. However, opponents, including Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek, argue it would 'punch a huge hole' in the state's budget and put essential services at risk. According to the Legislative Revenue Office, the measure would create a $2 billion budget shortfall within five years.

The measure will tax large corporations with revenue over $25 million in Oregon at 3 pennies per dollar, with the generated revenue distributed to every person in Oregon, including kids and seniors, as a rebate of about $1,600 per person. This will help individuals pay for monthly costs or save for the future. The tax will not affect small businesses, and the revenue generated will benefit the local and state economies. According to the Legislative Revenue Office, only 1.8% of corporations will pay the new tax, and the tax burden for small businesses will remain the same. The measure will not cause mass inflation, with a potential increase in costs of up to 1.3% over five years. With each person getting $1,600 per year, they will still be significantly better off after paying the potential increased costs. As stated by the author, 'Measure 118 is the right approach to provide a much needed tax break or rebate to everyday Oregonians and small business owners.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 11:28 PM\nSource:[bizjournals.com](https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2024/10/29/opinion-yes-measure-118.html)\n\n**Oregon's universal basic income measure headed for defeat, ranked choice elections measure faces even odds of passage or rejection, poll finds**\nA proposed Oregon ballot measure to provide every resident with $1,600 per year through corporate tax increases is likely to be defeated.

The measure would increase the minimum tax on corporations with in-state sales greater than $25 million by 3% to pay everyone the rebate, regardless of income. From the proceeds, most Oregon residents would receive an annual tax rebate, but some people with lower incomes could opt for a direct cash payment. The state estimates 84% of people would choose a rebate via a refundable tax credit on personal income tax returns, reducing their tax bill. Rebates were estimated at $750 when proponents first began seeking signatures to put the issue to voters; a new state analysis estimates the rebate is likely to be as much as $1,160 in 2026 and $1,605 by 2027.

The report also notes that many companies would pass the tax on in the form of higher prices, and that the positive economic impact of rebate payments would be watered down due to federal taxes and high-income households saving the windfall.

However, Trump shows strength among voters who intend to vote but have not yet done so.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 12:18 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/politics/trump-and-harris-in-a-tight-race-in-the-7-battleground-states-nytsiena-poll-3699071)\n\n**US Presidential Election: Pennsylvania Key to Harris or Trump's Victory**\nThe 2024 US presidential election is expected to be one of the closest and most contentious in American history. According to a New York Times public opinion tracker, as of Sunday, all seven swing states were roughly tied. Trump had a 3-point lead in Arizona, while the other six states were within one point of each other. The election is expected to be decided by a small margin, with 43,000 votes making the difference in 2020. Pennsylvania, with 19 electoral votes, is the most crucial state in the seven swing states. If Harris loses Pennsylvania, she would need to win North Carolina or Georgia, which have voted for Democratic candidates only three times in the past four decades. On the other hand, if Trump loses Pennsylvania, he would need to win Wisconsin or Michigan, which have voted for Republican candidates only once in the past four decades. Both Harris and Trump have focused heavily on Pennsylvania, with the two campaigns and their allies spending $279.3 million on advertising in the state, more than in any other state. The outcome of the election will depend on the results in these seven swing states, with the winner needing to secure 270 electoral votes out of 538 to win the presidency.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 10:07 AM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/hi/explainer-why-voters-in-a-handful-of-swing-states-will-decide-the-us-presidential-election/a-70677316)\n\n**Here's the key to reading the tight polls and predicting a Trump win**\nThe author of a New York Post piece predicting Donald Trump's win in the 2024 presidential election explains how they derived their numbers. They argue that the key to reading tight polls is understanding the balance between Democrats and Republicans among voters, or partisan preference. The author notes that pollsters use weighting methods to adjust for demographic differences, but these methods can be flawed. They use data from two recent national polls to show how different weighting methods can produce different results. The author then averages the findings of each poll to estimate the partisan breakdown, which shows Harris leading with Democrats by 89 points and Trump leading with Republicans by 87 points. They use this estimate to compute the national popular vote totals under different partisan scenarios, concluding that Trump would win the popular vote by a 0.46-point margin in an R+2 electorate. The author predicts the popular vote percentages, with Harris winning by 1.3 points, and uses this to call the Electoral College. They argue that Trump would carry every swing state, giving him 312 electoral votes to Harris' 229. However, they mention three reasons why Harris could still win: a D-friendly electorate, Harris doing better with independents, or a dramatic reduction in the Electoral College gap. They reject each of these possibilities, citing data on voter registration and poll analysis. The author concludes that the cumulative weight of the evidence suggests Trump has the better chance of prevailing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 04:18 AM\nSource:[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2024/11/03/us-news/heres-the-key-to-reading-the-tight-polls-and-predicting-a-trump-win/)\n\n**Confidence and Panic: The State of Mind of Trump Supporters and Democrats**\nVivek Ramaswamy, a supporter of Donald Trump, has stated that New York is a 'pivot state', despite the fact that Kamala Harris is leading in the polls with 54.6% of the intentions of vote compared to 39.4% for Donald Trump. This confidence is reflected in the state of mind of many Trump supporters, who are predicting a landslide victory for the former president. Meanwhile, Democrats are nervous and anxious, with many of their strategists, candidates, and celebrities expressing their doubts and fears about the presidential campaign of Kamala Harris. According to a recent article by Axios, many Democrats are privately expressing their concerns that Harris may lose, despite the polls indicating a close race. 'Why are Democrats nervous? Because they are Democrats,' wrote Josh Marshall, editor-in-chief of Talking Points Memo, in 2020. 'Independently of objective realities, Democrats will always anticipate a defeat or worry about it, while Republicans will always be confident in their victory.' The 2022 midterm elections illustrated this phenomenon, with Republicans predicting a red wave that would give them a majority in both the House and Senate, while Democrats were worried about their chances. However, the final result showed that Democrats increased their majority in the Senate and limited their losses in the House. 'It's not a rule, but it's almost a law of American politics,' Marshall wrote. 'Donald Trump may win the election, but the current polls do not justify the triumphalism of some Republicans, nor do they justify the panic of some Democrats.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[La Presse.ca](https://www.lapresse.ca/elections-americaines/2024-10-29/confiance-republicaine-panique-democrate.php)\n\n**Trump vs. Harris: Who's Leading in New York?**\nWith just days to go before the US presidential elections on November 5, 2024, candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are intensifying their campaigns to win over voters and secure the White House for the 2024-2028 term. In New York, early voting has begun, and many residents have cast their ballots, showing strong support for presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who is leading by a significant margin in the state's polls. According to a Fivethirtyeight.com poll from October 29, Harris is leading Trump by +15.2 points, with 54.6% of voters intending to vote for her compared to 39.4% for Trump. This reflects strong support from New York citizens and some Latinos living in the state for the Democratic candidate and current Vice President Kamala Harris.

Trump Can Win New York State**\nDonald Trump's recent rally at Madison Square Garden was a huge success, with 20,000 seats sold out in 3 hours and tens of thousands watching on big screens outside. Experts may be writing off Trump's chances of winning New York State, but his campaign strategy, which includes visiting minority neighborhoods and speaking with locals, has shown promise. Trump's polling numbers in NYC have recently increased to 27%, and factoring in his history of under polling, he may be at 30% or higher. To win, Trump only needs to flip a little over half of those who voted for someone other than Lee Zeldin in the 2022 election, who were disaffected and angry over Democratic policies. As Trump has overcome odds steeper than this before, it's not impossible for him to win. 'Experts' writing off any chance of the former president winning the Empire State could be overlooking the 2022 run Lee Zeldin made against Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul, where Zeldin got 30% of the vote and lost by less than 6 points, after repeatedly saying that if he won 35% of the vote in NYC, he'd be NY's chief executive.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 02:07 AM\nSource:[www.independentsentinel.com](https://www.independentsentinel.com/how-donald-j-trump-can-win-new-york-state/)\n\n**Is Harris losing ground to Trump?

According to polls, the election is expected to be polarized, with both candidates neck and neck in the popular vote and key states. As reported by 'The New York Times' and 'FiveThirtyEight', the current projections indicate that Donald Trump has a slight advantage over Kamala Harris and would win the election. However, the outcome is still uncertain, and the election will likely be decided by individual votes. 'The New York Times' and 'FiveThirtyEight' use different methodologies, which may result in varying numbers. To win the election, a candidate needs to secure 270 out of 538 electoral votes. The candidate who wins the most votes in a state gets all of that state's electoral votes, regardless of the margin of victory. Currently, the polls indicate that Kamala Harris has a numerical advantage, but Donald Trump is leading in the national average. According to 'The New York Times', Kamala Harris has 49% of the vote, while Donald Trump has 48%.

However, The New York Times notes that 'simple math proves the inevitable defeat of the Republican candidate.' But, as we know, Trump won in 2016, defying expectations. The paper suggests that the polls may have been flawed, with social scientists focusing on the wrong statistics or being influenced by their clients. The current polls show a three-percentage-point lead for Harris, but other surveys give Trump a 1.2% lead. The outcome of the election will depend on the number of electoral votes each candidate receives, with 583 votes in total. In most states, the winner takes all, so a candidate can win by a large margin but still lose the election. The current polls show Trump leading in six of the seven 'swing' states, but the margin is very small. The situation in these states will be crucial in determining the outcome of the election. Meanwhile, financial markets are predicting a Trump victory, with a 56% chance of him winning, according to the Polymarket website. 'This is a game of margins,' says Harris's advisor, David Plouffe.

The Hill's data collection, which began in August, shows a narrowing gap between the candidates, but Harris still leads by 16%. New York is considered a 'blue' state, where Democrats have historically received strong support. The state's 28 electoral votes are crucial in the election, as a candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win. Harris has been leading in several recent polls in New York, including a survey by ActiVote, which found that she leads Trump by 21.2% with 60.6% of the vote, while Trump has 39.4%.

This shift in voter sentiment raises the possibility of Trump flipping multiple battleground states in his favor, setting up a potential return to the White House.

If Harris wins Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, and Trump wins the Sun Belt states, Harris could win the election with the 270 electoral votes needed.

This is an improvement from the 39 percent chance Trump was given on September 17, while Harris has dropped from a 61 percent chance of victory. G. Elliott Morris from 538 said, 'Harris' current lead in the race is 'barely better than a coin flip.' Slim margins in the swing states make this cycle's presidential race the closest in decades, with the outcome potentially being closer than in any election in nearly 150 years.' The New York Times/Siena poll shows Trump leading in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, while Harris can afford to lose these states if she wins the three 'blue wall' swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The Quinnipiac University poll shows Trump with a 1 point lead over Harris in a full ballot, and the pair are tied on 48 percent in a two-way race.

According to Nate Silver's projection, Trump has a 64% chance of winning 270 electoral votes. Recent polls, including a Pew national poll, show the race tied nationally, which would likely translate to a loss for Kamala Harris in the Electoral College. The New York Times and Pew polls also indicate that Trump is on track to win. CNN's Harry Enten noted that if Trump outperforms his polling by a single point, he would win. ABC News' Matthew Dowd attempted to downplay the polls, but Nate Silver dismissed his claims as a coping mechanism. The article concludes that Harris' record and agenda are liabilities, and that her lack of trustworthiness and grasp of issues are major concerns.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2024 09:46 AM\nSource:[Townhall](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2024/09/10/the-brutal-polling-is-starting-to-irritate-liberals-and-its-fantastic-to-watch-n2644517)\n\n**Trump and Harris Tied in Final Weeks of 2024 Election, Poll Shows**\nAccording to a national poll conducted by The New York Times and Siena College, presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are effectively tied in the final weeks of the 2024 election.

The poll suggests that Trump's base of support remains strong, with 28% of likely voters saying they need more information about Harris, compared to only 9% saying the same about Trump. The debate on Tuesday could be a crucial moment, with Harris having the opportunity to provide more details on her policies while facing off against Trump for 90 minutes. The poll's findings are similar to those of the last comparable poll from the New York Times/Siena College, published in late July, where Trump also led by a single point.

Trump, on the other hand, is reiterating his 'Make America Great Again' rhetoric, focusing on the economy, border security, and reducing federal government power. The election will be decided by the Electoral College, with each state having a number of electors equal to its number of senators and representatives. The candidate who wins the majority of the 538 electors, more than 270, will become the next president of the United States.

In the US electoral system, voters do not directly elect the president, but rather the 538 members of the electoral college. The winner will be determined by the candidate who receives at least 270 electoral votes, which will be cast by the electors on December 17. The votes will be counted on January 6, 2025, and the new president will be inaugurated on January 20. The US electoral system is decentralized, with each state having its own election laws. Early voting is an option for voters, allowing them to cast their ballots before November 5. Over 60 million voters have already cast their ballots in 47 states and the District of Columbia, where the capital Washington is located, according to CNN. This represents about 38% of the approximately 158 million votes cast in 2020. Ten states have already surpassed 50% of the total votes from four years ago, led by Georgia, where over two-thirds of the votes have already been cast.

The vice-president accused Trump of seeking 'unlimited power' and opposing her vision for 'a future full of promises'. Harris said, 'This election is 'the most important vote of your life', a choice between 'a country anchored in freedom for every American or one led by chaos and division'. 'We know who Donald Trump is,' she continued. 'He's the person who stood here, almost four years ago, and sent an armed mob to the Capitol to overturn the voice of the people in a free and fair election.' Harris described Trump as 'an unstable candidate, obsessed with vengeance, consumed by resentment, and seeking unlimited power' who wants 'to use the army against American citizens simply because they disagree with him, people he calls 'the enemy within'.' She contrasted this with her own 'to-do list' of priorities if she becomes president on January 20, 2025, including lowering the cost of living by 'cutting taxes for workers and the middle class' and passing a law against 'excessive price increases for food products'. Harris also promised credits for early childhood education and aid for first-time homebuyers.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 03:18 AM\nSource:[Le Point.fr](https://www.lepoint.fr/monde/presidentielle-americaine-le-requisitoire-final-de-kamala-harris-contre-donald-trump-et-le-pouvoir-sans-limite-30-10-2024-2574041_24.php)\n\n**Election 2024 Latest: With 1 week to go, Harris speaks in Washington as Trump stumps in Pennsylvania**\nVice President Kamala Harris delivered her campaign's 'closing argument' in Washington, D.C., one week before the 2024 election.

She also attacked former President Donald Trump's competency on the international stage, saying that world leaders think he is an easy mark. Harris pledged to 'restore' abortion rights and to work every day to build consensus and reach compromise to get things done. Trump responded to Harris' speech, calling it 'backward-looking' and saying that Harris is lying, name-calling, and clinging to the past. Trump also claimed that the Harris campaign had bused people to Washington for her rally. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden said that he hopes to 'keep Donald Trump out of the White House' and praised Harris for her efforts to win over Republicans and former Trump supporters. Harris took the stage in Washington, surrounded by American flags and signs that read 'Freedom' in block letters, and delivered a speech that was a direct contrast to the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.

However, experts note that national polls may not reflect the final result, as the US electoral system is indirect. In most states, the winner takes all the electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, where the votes are allocated proportionally.

The election will take place on November 5, but the result may not be clear for several days or even weeks due to recounts, early voting, and mail-in ballots. Republican-led legislatures have moved to restrict voters' choice and contest the integrity of absentee ballots, leading to a bigger chance of challenges being heard and upheld. Further judicial hearings are likely after November 5, with both parties preparing a rearguard of lawyers. The Electoral College is scheduled to convene on December 17 to certify the result, and the declaration of the result in Congress on January 6, 2025, is also a key flashpoint. Trump has threatened to turn the armed forces on Democrats who object in the event of him winning, but much of this will likely be empty bluster.

The election will take place on November 5, 2024, and will determine not only the next President of the United States but also the composition of the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate. The President of the United States serves as both head of government and head of state, but the Congress plays a crucial role in the legislative process and can even remove the President from office. The election will also determine the governors of 11 states and two territories. To be eligible for the presidency, a candidate must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years old, and a resident of the country for at least 14 years. The President is limited to two terms, which can be consecutive or non-consecutive. The winner of the election will be determined by the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors chosen by each state. The President-elect will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, in a ceremony at the Capitol Building. If no candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes, the House of Representatives will choose the President, and the Senate will choose the Vice President. This has only happened twice in U.S. history. 'The election is a crucial moment for the country, and it's essential to ensure that every vote is counted and every voice is heard,' said a spokesperson for the Democratic Party.

However, Harris has previously described Trump as 'fascist to the core,' 'unfit to serve,' and 'increasingly unstable and unhinged.' This rhetoric has already led to multiple attempts on Trump's life, and some speculate that Harris may refuse to acknowledge the will of the people in order to safeguard what she considers 'Our Democracy.'

The article provides a guide to the key issues and the electoral process for this significant event.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 05, 2024 04:47 AM\nSource:[Sky](https://tg24.sky.it/mondo/approfondimenti/elezioni-usa-2024)\n\n**US Presidential Elections 2024: All you need to know about 2024 elections in the United States**\nWith less than two months remaining until Election Day, the recent debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump offered a critical insight into the contentious presidential race. Harris presented a strong case against Trump, confronting him on issues such as abortion, immigration, and the state of American democracy. The two candidates have starkly differing visions for the country. The election is scheduled for Tuesday, November 5, 2024, and the winning candidate will hold office for a four-year term starting in January 2025. Key issues dominating the 2024 election include the economy, healthcare, climate change, immigration, national security, and social justice. The Democrats are considered the more liberal party, advocating for civil rights, a broad social safety net, and initiatives to combat climate change. The Republicans, on the other hand, represent conservative values, promoting lower taxes, government reduction, gun rights, and stricter immigration and abortion policies. Harris's nomination for the upcoming November elections would be historic, mirroring her achievement in 2020 when she became the first woman, Black woman, and person of South Asian descent to serve as Vice President of the United States. Harris is recognized for her advocacy on issues such as criminal justice reform, healthcare, and immigration. Trump, on the other hand, is an American businessman, television personality, and politician who served as the 45th president of the United States from January 20, 2017, to January 20, 2021. For the 2024 elections, he has secured the Republican nomination. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 13, 2024 08:28 AM\nSource:[The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/us-presidential-elections-2024-all-you-need-to-know-about-2024-elections-in-the-united-states-9565491)\n\n**2024 US Presidential election: Key dates left on path to election day**\nThe 2024 US presidential election is underway with Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump facing off in their first debate.

In Africa, Botswana reported one XEC case from a hospitalized European traveler. The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated XEC as a variant under monitoring (VUMs). Preliminary data suggests that XEC may have increased transmissibility and immune evasion, but there is no evidence that it causes more severe illness than previous Omicron variants.

Preliminary data suggests that XEC has increased transmissibility and unique mutations that may contribute to higher immune evasion, but there is no evidence that it causes more severe illness. The symptoms of XEC infection are similar to those associated with Omicron sub-variants.

This decision follows a summer COVID-19 surge that led to more hospitalizations among vulnerable Americans. Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of global health and infectious diseases at Stanford University, says that the additional dose will help to keep older people protected throughout the year, reducing the risk of hospitalization from the disease. The current mRNA vaccines target the KP.2 variant, but the dominant version causing infections in the U.S. right now is the KP.3.1.1 variant. Dr. Steven Furr, board chair of the American Academy of Family Physicians, says that the vaccine still provides sufficient protection from severe disease, and that it decreases hospitalizations and risk of death. However, vaccination rates are still relatively low, and family physicians are struggling to get enough doses to meet demand. 'The point of [vaccination] has never been to stop all infections,' says Maldonado. 'We’ve never had the aim of stopping transmission and all infections. The idea was to stop hospitalizations and stop deaths.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[health-topic.com](http://health-topic.com/2024/11/04/why-you-might-need-two-covid-19-shots-this-season/)\n\n**COVID-19 Variant XEC Is Highly Transmissible: Should We Be Worried?**\nA new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has emerged in the United States and is rapidly spreading, potentially becoming the dominant strain this winter. According to health experts, XEC is a subvariant of Omicron, first detected in Germany in June 2024, and is not currently believed to cause more severe symptoms than other recent strains. However, COVID-19 infections still pose a greater risk for certain people, like older adults and those with weakened immune systems. Dr. Scott Roberts from Yale Medicine notes that XEC's rapid spread in some European countries indicates its potential to become the dominant strain in the coming months. Current COVID-19 vaccines, updated for the 2024-2025 season, are expected to provide some level of protection against XEC, and vaccination is recommended for everyone aged six months and older to help minimize the spread of the virus. Dr. Roberts advises following standard precautions, such as staying away from sick individuals, wearing masks in crowded indoor settings, and considering antivirals like Paxlovid if you test positive for COVID-19.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 02, 2024 06:35 AM\nSource:[sciencetimes.com](https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/51526/20241102/covid-19-variant-xec-highly-transmissible.htm)\n\n**New COVID-19 Variants: KP.3 and XEC**\nThere has been a rise in COVID-19 infections in Europe, with a test positivity rate of over 20% in some countries. In the US, hospitalizations have increased, likely due to a wave of COVID-19 infections in Singapore. As we move into autumn and winter in the Northern Hemisphere, concerns are growing about two new variants: KP.3 and XEC. KP.3 has been designated as a global concerning variant (VOC) by the US CDC, but only in the US. The CDC recommends that people get an updated COVID-19 vaccine for 2024-2025. KP.3 is a subvariant of the Omicron variant, and XEC is a recombinant variant related to KP.3. According to Francois Balloux, a professor of computational systems biology, XEC is likely a recombination between the subvariants KP.3.3 and KS.1.1. XEC was first detected in Germany in June, but it is not yet listed on the COVID-19 dashboard of the Robert Koch Institute. The focus in Germany remains on KP.3.1.1, which is dominant and considered more contagious than previous variants. According to Sandra Ciesek, a virologist, it is not surprising that KP.3.1.1 is more contagious, as the virus constantly mutates to find new ways to infect people. However, this does not mean that the variant causes more severe illness. The FLiRT variants, including KP.3 and XEC, are considered potentially more dangerous than previous versions of SARS-CoV-2 due to mutations in key areas of the spike protein. Paul Hunter, a medical professor at the University of East Anglia, said that FLiRT is a serious concern, as it allows the virus to evade immunity and reproduce more effectively. The CDC has stated that KP.3.1.1 was likely responsible for 30-40% of clinical COVID-19 cases in the US in mid-August, and that the risks associated with this variant are particularly acute for people over 65 and children under 2.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 01:49 AM\nSource:[bwabtk.com](https://bwabtk.com/was-sie-wissen-muessen-dw-22-10-2024/)\n\n**CDC: XEC COVID-19 variant circulating in the US**\nThe XEC COVID-19 variant is now circulating in the United States, making up about 10% of all COVID-19 cases reported in the country as of October 13, according to the CDC's Nowcast tracking tool. The variant is a recombinant of the Omicron strain and has spread across Germany, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands. A CDC official described XEC as a 'recombinant, or hybrid, of the closely related Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3.' UK Health Security Agency epidemiologist Jamie Lopez Bernal said that their surveillance has shown that about 1 in 10 COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom come from the XEC lineage, but 'current information doesn't suggest we should be more concerned about this variant.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants in the population, including XEC, but stressed that 'specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' The CDC spokesperson recommended that people aged 6 months and older get one of the updated COVID-19 vaccines that were signed off by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over the summer. COVID-19 levels are currently at 'low' levels across the United States, with 'high' levels reported in most New England states, the Pacific Northwest, and several mountain region states.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[signalscv.com](https://signalscv.com/2024/10/cdc-xec-covid-19-variant-circulating-in-the-us/)\n\n**The Emergence of the New XEC Variant: A Concern for Public Health**\nThe emergence of the new XEC variant of the coronavirus has raised concerns about its high transmissibility and potential impact on public health. The variant is believed to have originated from the combination of KP.3 and KS.1.1 subvariants. According to Dr. François Balloux, a computer scientist and director of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology at University College London, 'the XEC gene is likely the result of a genetic recombination between the KP.3.3 and KS.1.1 subvariants.' The XEC variant was first detected in Germany in June, but it has not been reported on the COVID-19 dashboard of the Robert Koch Institute. Dr. Sandra Ciesek, a virologist at the German Center for Infection Research, stated that 'the emergence of KP.3.1.1 is not surprising, given its higher transmissibility.' She added that 'the virus continues to evolve in search of new ways to spread, but this does not mean that the variant causes a more severe disease.' Dr. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, noted that 'the term FLiRT seems like an odd abbreviation, but it remains stuck in my mind due to its serious implications.' FLiRT plays a crucial role in the virus's ability to grow and bind to living cells, making it easier for it to infect and spread. A study published in July 2024 found that the KP.2 subvariant has 'a greater ability to evade the immunity induced by the vaccine,' reflecting its evolution and adaptation to the immune response. Additionally, the KP.2 subvariant has been shown to replicate more efficiently compared to the original JN.1 variant. The KP.3.1.1 subvariant has been responsible for 30-40% of COVID-19 clinical samples in the United States in mid-August 2024, indicating a significant increase from the previous week's rate of 20-26%, which suggests its rapid spread over a short period.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 06:49 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/ar/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%B8%D9%87%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%B1-xec-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7/a-70596110)\n\n**COVID genomic surveillance details rise, evolution of JN.1 in US this year**\nNew genomic surveillance data published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report shows that JN.1 and its descendants have been the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants in 2024, and are still evolving. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's national SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance program analyzed 208,357 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 56 US jurisdictions from May 2023 through September 2024. The data shows that JN.1 emerged in the US and rapidly became the dominant variant, causing surges in COVID-19 cases in winter 2024. Further surges were seen in summer 2024 due to the emergence of JN.1 descendant lineages with immune escape and increased transmissibility. The authors conclude that continued monitoring is necessary to update COVID-19 vaccines and anticipate future surges in COVID-19 activity, as 'the pattern of divergent variant emergence followed by subsequent stepwise evolutionary changes continues.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 07:10 PM\nSource:[CIDRAP](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/covid-genomic-surveillance-details-rise-evolution-jn1-us-year)\n\n**New COVID XEC variant: What you need to know**\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is seeing a rise in infections, particularly in the US, where the number of hospitalizations has increased.

The variant, a recombinant of the Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, has been seen in hundreds of cases in Germany, France, Denmark, and Netherlands. The CDC's Nowcast data tracker shows that the KP.3.1.1 variant accounted for 57.2% of positive infections, followed by XEC at 10.7% in the two-week stretch starting on Sept. 29 and ending on Oct. 12. Rosa Norman, a CDC spokesperson, said, 'CDC is monitoring the XEC variant.' The CDC has not reported any new or unusual symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2. The basic symptoms of COVID-19 can appear between two and 14 days after exposure to the virus and can range from mild to severe. The CDC advises seeking medical attention if you have the following symptoms: 'CDC is not aware of new or unusual symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2,' Norman said.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 08:17 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/covid-19-xec-variant-now-201226577.html)\n\n**XEC Variant: Experts Warn of Potential Increase in COVID-19 Cases this Fall**\nAccording to Dr. Peter Chin Hong, a specialist in infectious diseases at the University of California in San Francisco, the XEC variant is a recombinant of two other variants, KS 1.1. and KP 3.3. 'It has a mutation that we don't know much about,' he said, warning that the reason people are paying attention is that it seemed to rise particularly in Germany, where it represents around 15% of cases, and in the UK, 17%. 'In the US, it hasn't reached that level yet, but it could come in the winter and be a bit more transmissible,' Dr. Hong noted. He considered the situation 'not to cause serious problems, because immunity is generally high' and emphasized that 'the most important thing is to get vaccinated, to protect yourself from serious illness, hospitalization, and death.' The dominant subvariant in the US at the moment is KP 3.1, responsible for around 50% of cases. 'It's part of the Omicron family, and somehow it figured out how to stay in the population, spread very successfully, and keep mutating,' Dr. Hong said.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 03, 2024 02:36 PM\nSource:[Prensa latina](https://www.prensa-latina.cu/2024/10/03/anticipan-aumento-de-casos-de-covid-19-este-otono-en-eeuu/)\n\n**Free COVID tests return as CDC says this one variant now accounts for nearly 60% of cases**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the COVID-19 variant KP.3.1.1 now accounts for nearly 60% of positive infections in the United States, according to the agency's Nowcast data tracker.

Adams. While there's no indication that XEC will increase the severity of the virus, it could potentially become a dominant strain due to its increased contagiousness. However, current COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots are effective against XEC as it is a hybrid of two Omicron strains. Adams said, 'We often use what happens in Europe as a good indication of what might happen here.' The CDC continues to monitor the emergence of variants in the population and recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the virus. The dominant COVID-19 variant KP.3.1.1 accounts for over 50% of cases in the US, according to recent CDC projections.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 03:00 PM\nSource:[MSN](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/is-the-hybrid-covid-variant-xec-in-the-us-what-to-know-about-the-new-strain-that-s-more-contagious/ar-AA1qWHeK)\n\n**XEC Variant of COVID-19 Gaining Traction, But KP.3.1.1 Remains Dominant in US**\nThe XEC variant of COVID-19 is gaining traction, with some experts predicting it will become the dominant strain this fall. According to Raj Rajnarayanan, a professor at Nyitcom-Arkansas State University, XEC has the potential to become the most circulating lineage by November, currently circulating at around 5-7% globally. Eric Topol, a scientist at Scripps Research, also believes XEC is the most likely to take hold. However, the CDC reports that KP.3.1.1 is currently the dominant strain in the US, representing over 50% of cases. The CDC also notes that there are no specific symptoms associated with XEC or other co-circulating strains. Experts recommend getting vaccinated with updated vaccines, which are expected to provide good protection in the upcoming winter. Some experts are cautious about XEC's evolution, noting that it is a recombinant of KP.3.3 and KS.1.1, and that its success may be due to a mutation inherited from KP.3.3. However, one expert notes that XEC's 'spike' protein is almost identical to that of KP.3.1.1, and that the differences in other viral regions may be insignificant.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 22, 2024 05:17 PM\nSource:[Leggo](https://www.leggo.it/schede/covid_quale_variante_dominante_autunno_xec_kp_3_1_1_oggi_22_9_2024-8369879.html)\n\n**More free COVID-19 tests are coming.

The tests will be able to detect the dominant variants of the virus, including subvariant KP.3.1.1, which makes up 37% of cases in the US. According to the CDC, the new tests will also be able to detect subvariant KP.3, which makes up over 16% of cases. In North Carolina, wastewater treatment plants are still measuring COVID-19 levels through viral particles present in wastewater. The NC Department of Health and Human Services is tracking levels of the virus, with recent measurements showing high levels in several areas, including Boone and Spruce Pine. The CDC warns that symptoms of COVID-19 can be different based on the variant, and advises checking the CDC website for more information.

According to Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Institute's Translational Research Institute in La Jolla, 'At this stage, it appears that the XEC variant is the most likely to spread.' Researchers had predicted in August that this variant would spread faster in a few weeks to a month. XEC, a sub-lineage of the 'Omicron' variant, was first reported in Berlin, Germany in June and is now spreading 'very quickly' across Europe, North America, and Asia, according to COVID-19 data analyst Mike Hoenig. Slovenia reported high infection rates in August, with over 10% of COVID-19 cases in the country containing XEC. Experts say the new strain, a sub-lineage of the 'Omicron' variant, has some new mutations that may help it spread this fall. They explain that XEC is a hybrid of previously discovered Omicron sub-variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3. KS.1.1 is a type of the FLiRT family of sub-variants, while KP.3.3 belongs to the FLuQE category. So far, more than 500 samples from 27 countries, including Poland, Norway, Luxembourg, Ukraine, Portugal, and China, have been found to contain XEC. Analysts point to strong growth of the variant in Denmark, Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands. As the virus continues to evolve, data shows that XEC is growing steadily every day with an advantage over previously known sub-variants. Its symptoms are similar to those of previous COVID-19 variants, including fever, sore throat, cough, loss of smell, loss of appetite, and body aches. However, since it is still just a sub-lineage of the same Omicron variant, experts say that following vaccination and booster shots will provide sufficient protection against severe illness and hospitalization. They also advise practicing good hygiene and taking steps to improve air quality. Researchers are calling for close monitoring of the XEC variant to better understand its symptoms.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 19, 2024 07:27 AM\nSource:[INAIQT](https://www.ina.iq/217212--.html)\n\n**New COVID variant XEC now in half of states. Here's what to know.**\nA new COVID-19 variant called XEC has been spotted in half of the states across the United States, according to preliminary data from the global virus database GISAID. Health officials are not raising concern about this variant, unlike some previous, more highly mutated strains. The variant's emergence comes as COVID-19 trends remain 'high' but are now largely slowing after a summer wave of infections. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention modelers estimate that the virus will likely climb again over the winter, peaking in mid-January. Carla Finkielstein, head of the molecular diagnostics lab at Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, said, 'We do not see a particular trend. We should keep an eye on the samples coming and continue genomic screening more broadly.' The CDC is not aware of any specific symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineage. Americans are still recommended to get this fall and winter's round of updated COVID-19 vaccines, which target the KP.2 strain of the virus.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2024 07:55 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/xec-covid-variant-symptoms-states-what-to-know/)\n\n**New Covid-19 Variant XEC: Will it Cause a Surge in Cases this Fall?**\nAccording to Forbes, the summer of 2024 has been dubbed the 'Covid summer' due to the significant increase in coronavirus cases in July 2022, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through wastewater monitoring. However, there is a lack of data on the current situation, as many people have stopped taking Covid-19 tests, and those who do take them often do not report the results. As a result, the number of Covid-19 cases is likely significantly underestimated. The summer surge, which likely began in early June, was caused by sub-variants KP.3.1.1 and KP.3.3 in the FLiRT sub-lineage. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Institute, stated that the spread of the new variant XEC 'is just beginning' and will take a few months to establish itself and cause its own wave. Topol added that XEC is likely to become the dominant variant, but it will take several months for its spread to reach high levels. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the end of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2022, with 775 million confirmed cases and over 7 million deaths reported from the start of the pandemic to the end of June 2024.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 17, 2024 04:07 PM\nSource:[НОВОСТИ Mail.Ru](https://news.mail.ru/society/62836263/)\n\n**New Corona Variant 'Even More Infectious': A Potential Wave of Infections Looms**\nA new study suggests that the latest Corona variant, KP. 3.1.1, is even more infectious than its predecessor. According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), this variant is responsible for 72% of all infections in Germany. The number of Corona infections is already on the rise, as shown by the RKI's wastewater monitoring and the Health Ministry's infection radar. Timo Ulrichs, a virologist, said, 'The studies on this new subvariant of JN.1 show that the mutations have given the virus a higher reproduction number and thus a higher fitness for spreading.' A severe infection wave may be looming. However, the symptoms of a Covid-19 infection caused by KP. 3.1.1 are largely similar to those of previous variants, including fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and loss of taste or smell. There is currently no evidence that this variant leads to more severe disease courses. The Standing Vaccination Commission recommends that people over 60 continue to get vaccinated, as they are at a particularly high risk of severe Covid-19.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 14, 2024 01:29 PM\nSource:[Frankfurter Rundschau](https://www.fr.de/panorama/infektionswelle-droht-studie-zeigt-neue-corona-variante-noch-infektioeser-massive-93298415.html)\n\n**New Coronavirus Variants May Be Evading Immunity**\nAccording to the Rospotrebnadzor molecular-genetic monitoring data, the proportion of circulating variants of the new coronavirus KP.3 and LB.1, which are part of the FLiRT subline, has increased by 2.5 times in the Russian Federation over the past two to three weeks. 'These variants have special mutations in the spike protein, which allows the virus to evade the immune response while maintaining its ability to effectively infect cells,' the Rospotrebnadzor statement said. The agency noted that the sharp increase in the variants led to a surge in COVID-19 cases in Russia at the beginning of September 2024.

The data is based on the Grippeweb survey system, which has around 8,500 volunteers providing anonymous health information to the RKI once a week. The results are generally reliable and consistent with the data obtained through wastewater monitoring. The number of severe cases remains low, with about two people per million inhabitants requiring intensive care for COVID-19, mainly affecting people over 60 years old. Since October 2023, around 400,000 COVID-19 infections have been confirmed through PCR tests, with about a third (133,000) requiring hospitalization. The dominant variant of the virus is KP.3.1.1, which accounts for 72% of all infections and is part of the FLIRT variants. Japanese scientists have found that KP.3.1.1 is more contagious than its predecessors XBB.1.5 and JN.1, and that antibodies formed against these variants are less effective against the current variant. US media have reported that patients with KP.3.1.1 infections are experiencing symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue. The overall situation regarding respiratory infections remains stable, with around 4.4 million people in Germany newly infected in the past week, a typical value for this time of year. However, there have been changes in the age groups, with a decrease in new infections among children and an increase among adults.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 12, 2024 03:10 PM\nSource:[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk](https://www.mdr.de/wissen/medizin-gesundheit/corona-herbstwelle-rollt-variante-kp-dreieineins-ansteckender-symptome-100.html)\n\n**COVID-19 remained at 'very high' activity levels across the US: See latest data**\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly half of the United States reported 'very high' levels of COVID-19 activity last month.

According to the Economic Times, FLiRT is a sub-variant of Omicron, and its sub-variants KP.3, KP.2, and KP.1.1 have been detected in 36.9%, 24.4%, and 9.1% of infections respectively. The CDC reports that the number of COVID-19 cases in 7 US states is increasing, with 17% of tests coming back positive. This has led to an increase in hospitalizations, although the rate of increase is slowing in some states. The FLiRT variant is highly contagious but has mild symptoms. In Europe, the XEC sub-variant is causing concern, with cases reported in several countries. Scientists are monitoring the situation closely, and a California physician predicts that XEC will become the dominant variant in the coming time. Currently, there is no vaccine available that provides protection against the new variants. A new vaccine that targets Omicron is expected to be available in the US in September, but its effectiveness against the new strain is unclear. 'It is a matter of concern that the new variants are spreading rapidly, and we need to be prepared to face the challenge,' said a health expert.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: September 09, 2024 12:42 PM\nSource:[News18 India](https://hindi.news18.com/news/lifestyle/health-another-covid-wave-in-us-europe-new-variant-of-corona-virus-flirt-spreading-like-wildfire-new-vaccine-8671589.html)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

In Africa, Botswana reported one XEC case from a hospitalized European traveler. The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated XEC as a variant under monitoring (VUMs). Preliminary data suggests that XEC has increased transmissibility and unique mutations that may contribute to higher immune evasion, but there is no evidence that it causes more severe illness than previous Omicron variants. The Africa CDC advises Member States to strengthen sentinel and genomic surveillance in Africa and to be cautious in their approach to XEC. 'A rising prevalence XEC subvariant in several countries warrants a cautious approach and strengthening sentinel and genomic surveillance in Africa,' the Africa CDC statement says. 'While additional evidence is needed to determine the possible impact of XEC and other emerging variants in Africa, this statement is being sent out to increase Member State awareness of the situation.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 08:34 AM\nSource:[allAfrica](https://allafrica.com/stories/202411050030.html)\n\n**CDC: Some people may need another COVID vaccine by spring**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending that high-risk adults, including those 65 and up and those with weakened immune systems, receive a second updated COVID vaccine by spring.

According to health experts, XEC is a subvariant of Omicron, first detected in Germany in June 2024, and is not currently believed to cause more severe symptoms than other recent strains. However, COVID-19 infections still pose a greater risk for certain people, like older adults and those with weakened immune systems. Dr. Scott Roberts from Yale Medicine notes that XEC's rapid spread in some European countries indicates its potential to become the dominant strain in the coming months. Current COVID-19 vaccines, updated for the 2024-2025 season, are expected to provide some level of protection against XEC, and vaccination is recommended for everyone aged six months and older to help minimize the spread of the virus. Dr. Roberts advises following standard precautions, such as staying away from sick individuals, wearing masks in crowded indoor settings, and considering antivirals like Paxlovid if you test positive for COVID-19.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 02, 2024 06:35 AM\nSource:[sciencetimes.com](https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/51526/20241102/covid-19-variant-xec-highly-transmissible.htm)\n\n**CDC: XEC COVID-19 variant circulating in the US**\nThe XEC COVID-19 variant is now circulating in the United States, making up about 10% of all COVID-19 cases reported in the country as of October 13, according to the CDC's Nowcast tracking tool. The variant is a recombinant of the Omicron strain and has spread across Germany, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands. A CDC official described XEC as a 'recombinant, or hybrid, of the closely related Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3.' UK Health Security Agency epidemiologist Jamie Lopez Bernal said that their surveillance has shown that about 1 in 10 COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom come from the XEC lineage, but 'current information doesn't suggest we should be more concerned about this variant.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants in the population, including XEC, but stressed that 'specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' The CDC spokesperson recommended that people aged 6 months and older get one of the updated COVID-19 vaccines that were signed off by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over the summer.

According to Francois Balloux, Professor of Computational Systems Biology, 'XEC is a likely recombinant between the subvariants KP.3.3 and KS.1.1.' The XEC variant has been reported in double-digits in Germany since June, but its spread is difficult to predict. In contrast, the KP.3.1.1 variant remains the most dominant, with a potential to be more dangerous than previous versions of SARS-CoV-2. The CDC has warned that KP.3.1.1 is particularly acute for people older than 65 years of age and children younger than 2 years.

Experts agree that due to its rapid spread, XEC could become the dominant sub-variant during the winter season. According to Dr. Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, XEC 'seems to be the variant that has the most probability of developing' in the coming months. Currently, Europe is experiencing the highest number of cases in the world, with 309,941 cases reported in the last 28 days (as of October 6, 2024). The UKHSA has recently warned about the surge in cases related to the new strain. In the US, at least 24 states have confirmed the presence of this variant. The World Health Organization (WHO) is keeping XEC under surveillance, but it is not yet considered a variant of concern. According to the WHO, XEC occupies the second place in terms of prevalence, with the KP.3.1.1 variant still leading. The symptoms of XEC are similar to those of other recent variants, including: cough, fatigue, sore throat, headache, congestion, runny nose, diarrhea, fever or chills, and difficulty breathing. There is no evidence that XEC causes different symptoms or a more severe illness compared to recent variants. Dr. Scott Roberts, an infectious disease specialist at Yale Medicine, stated that XEC was born from two sub-variants of Omicron, and therefore, all updated vaccines that target this strain should be effective against it. This includes the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna (designed to target KP.2) and the latest Novavax vaccine that also targets an earlier strain, JN.1. Adults over 65 and people with comorbidities are the most vulnerable to this and any other COVID-19 variant. In Mexico, there have been no reports of XEC circulation. The country's predominant strain is still JN.1, although KP.3 has gained relevance. From January to October 2024, there have been 138,807 cases of COVID-19 and 625 deaths in Mexico, according to the Subsecretaría de Prevención y Promoción de la Salud. A nationwide vaccination campaign against influenza and COVID-19 will be held from October 15, 2024, to March 28, 2025, with over 156,000 immunologicals to be administered.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 06:06 AM\nSource:[Milenio.com](https://www.milenio.com/ciencia-y-salud/xec-nueva-variante-de-covid-19-cuales-son-sus-sintomas)\n\n**XEC COVID Variant Circulating in the US, CDC Says**\nRecent estimates published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that the XEC variant of COVID-19 is already circulating in the interior of the United States. According to the CDC's Nowcast tracking tool, XEC represents around 10% of all COVID-19 cases reported in the country as of October 13. It is now the second most common COVID-19 strain in the country, behind the K.P.3.1.1 variant that emerged at the beginning of this year. Both variants derive from the Omicron strain that emerged at the end of 2021. The XEC variant first appeared in Berlin at the end of June and spread to Germany, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands, according to a report by data integration specialist Mike Honey, citing the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data. 'We are watching this variant closely, but the information we have does not suggest that we should be more concerned about it,' said Jamie López Bernal, epidemiologist at the UK's Health Security Agency. 'We understand that people may be worried about new variants.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants in the population, including XEC, but emphasizes that 'cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' According to Rosa Norman, CDC spokesperson, 'please continue to check the COVID Data Tracker for updated information on the common variants we are seeing in the US.' There is no evidence of any specific symptoms associated with the XEC variant or co-circulating strains. 'However, this new variant is likely to be similar to other COVID variants in terms of the disease it causes, given its similar genetic information. So, we can expect symptoms such as high fever, sore throat with cough, headaches and body aches, and fatigue,' noted GAVI, an organization aimed at increasing vaccination in poorer countries. The CDC recommends that people aged 6 months and older receive one of the updated COVID-19 vaccines approved by the US FDA during the summer. 'At this time, we anticipate that treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 will continue to work against all circulating variants,' said Norman. 'The CDC will continue to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and vaccines against circulating variants.' COVID-19 levels are currently 'low' in the US, according to CDC data as of October 5. However, a map provided by the agency shows that COVID-19 levels are 'high' in most states of New England, as well as in the northwest Pacific and several states in the mountainous region. Oregon and Montana are the only states in the country with 'very high' levels of viral activity, according to the CDC. Several other states also reported elevated levels of COVID-19.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 05:02 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN ÉPOCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/variante-xec-covid-19-circula-ee-uu-datos-cdc-1313537.html)\n\n**XEC COVID-19 Variant Now Circulating in the US: CDC Data**\nThe XEC COVID-19 variant is now circulating in the US, making up about 10% of all COVID-19 cases as of October 13, according to the CDC's Nowcast tracking tool.

UK Health Security Agency epidemiologist Jamie Lopez Bernal said that their surveillance has shown that about 1 in 10 COVID-19 cases in the UK come from the XEC lineage, but current information doesn't suggest that XEC is more severe. The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants in the population, including XEC, but stressed that specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants. The CDC recommends that people aged 6 months and older get one of the updated COVID-19 vaccines that were signed off by the FDA over the summer. COVID-19 levels are currently at 'low' levels across the US, with the exception of a few states in New England, the Pacific Northwest, and the mountain region.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 03:35 PM\nSource:[ntd.com](https://www.ntd.com/xec-covid-19-variant-now-circulating-in-the-us-cdc-data_1023341.html)\n\n**COVID-19 XEC variant is now circulating in the US. Here's what you should know about it.**\nThe COVID-19 XEC variant is now circulating in the US, according to the CDC. The variant, a recombinant of the Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, has been seen in hundreds of cases in Germany, France, Denmark, and Netherlands. The CDC's Nowcast data tracker shows that the KP.3.1.1 variant accounted for 57.2% of positive infections, followed by XEC at 10.7% in the two-week stretch starting on Sept. 29 and ending on Oct. 12. Rosa Norman, a CDC spokesperson, said, 'CDC is monitoring the XEC variant.' The CDC has not reported any new or unusual symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2. The basic symptoms of COVID-19 can appear between two and 14 days after exposure to the virus and can range from mild to severe. The CDC advises seeking medical attention if you have the following symptoms: 'CDC is not aware of new or unusual symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2,' Norman said.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 08:17 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/covid-19-xec-variant-now-201226577.html)\n\n**Covid, la variante Xec dilaga: tre cose da sapere**\nA new subvariant of the coronavirus, XEC, is spreading rapidly in the United States and could become the dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 by winter, when COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations tend to peak. According to experts, XEC is a recombinant variant, resulting from the fusion and reorganization of two pre-existing subvariants: Omicron KP.3.3 and KS.1.1. While there is no evidence that XEC causes different symptoms or more severe diseases than other recent variants, an infection remains concerning for certain individuals, such as the elderly or immunocompromised. As of September 30, XEC accounted for 5.7% of COVID-19 infections in the US, making it the fifth most widespread variant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Scott Roberts, an infectious disease specialist at Yale Medicine, warns that XEC has spread rapidly in some European areas, surpassing the growth of all other SARS-CoV-2 variants. 'The rate of XEC infections we're seeing in some countries has increased quite rapidly compared to previous variants,' he says. The CDC has reported XEC in at least 25 US states. As people begin to receive updated COVID-19 vaccines for the 2024-2025 season, available in the US since August, Roberts encourages everyone 6 months and older to get vaccinated with the updated vaccine to protect against the virus. 'One of the reasons for concern is that XEC has spread quite rapidly in some areas of Europe,' Roberts says.

While experts are uncertain about the extent of XEC's spread, its emergence has raised concerns about the ongoing evolution of the virus. Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist, said, 'We don't know if it will become a major player, but it has the characteristics that could make it a variant to watch.' XEC is a recombinant of two other strains and has rapidly spread in parts of Europe, prompting concerns about its potential impact in the US. However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that XEC is more contagious or causes more severe illness than existing variants. Epidemiologists are closely monitoring the spread of XEC to determine whether it is surpassing other variants. Initial findings suggest that vaccines, particularly those with bivalent boosters targeting Omicron, still offer protection against severe illness and hospitalization, but breakthrough infections are possible, especially among people who have not received recent booster doses.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2024 05:30 PM\nSource:[Times Now](https://www.timesnownews.com/health/new-covid-19-variant-xec-accounts-for-5-7-percent-of-us-cases-in-2-weeks-cdc-article-113789882)\n\n**XEC COVID-19 Variant Emerges: Here's What We Know**\nA new COVID-19 variant called XEC has emerged in multiple regions worldwide, including the US, according to the CDC.

Rosa Norman, a CDC spokeswoman, said, 'Please continue to check the COVID Data Tracker for updated information on the common variants we're seeing in the US.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants, including XEC, but Norman stated that 'specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' GAVI, a global health organization, also stated that XEC is likely to have similar symptoms to other COVID variants, such as a high temperature, sore throat, and body aches. Norman also noted that XEC is a recombinant variant of the Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, and that recombinants are not new, as seen with the XBB recombinant variant in 2023. The CDC recommends that people aged 6 months and older get a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine, which are expected to work against all circulating variants.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 07:58 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/xec-covid-19-variant-emerges-heres-what-we-know-5729304)\n\n**XEC: a new coronavirus variant with potential to become dominant worldwide**\nA new variant of the coronavirus, called XEC, is spreading rapidly and has the potential to become the dominant variant worldwide, according to The Conversation. Detected for the first time in Germany in August 2024, XEC is a 'recombinant variant', resulting from the exchange of genetic material between two parental variants: KS.1.1 and KP.3.3. Both variants evolved from JN.1, which was the global dominant variant at the beginning of 2024. Since its identification, XEC has been registered in over 600 cases in 27 countries, including the US, Germany, UK, Canada, and Denmark. The detection of the variant occurs through a public database known as Gisaid, which collects genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. The number of cases may be higher in countries that do not regularly sequence virus samples. XEC currently represents a small percentage of infections, with higher prevalence in Germany (around 13%) and lower in the US (less than 5%). Despite its current classification as a minority variant, XEC has shown a growth advantage over other circulating variants, suggesting it may become dominant in the coming months. A characteristic of XEC is the presence of specific mutations in the spike protein, crucial for infection, including the mutation T22N, from KS.1.1, and the mutation Q493E, from KP.3.3. These mutations may influence the virus's ability to replicate and spread, although there is not yet enough data to determine if XEC causes more severe diseases. The expected symptoms associated with this new variant are similar to those of other variants, including fever, sore throat, headaches, and fatigue. With the approaching winter, an increase in hospitalizations is expected due to the colder climate and increased virus spread, which should not be automatically attributed to the new variant. The UK's autumn vaccination campaign will begin in October, with updated vaccines for the JN.1 variant, from which XEC derives. This vaccination aims to ensure a good level of protection against severe diseases. Although XEC may become the dominant variant, the continuous evolution of the virus means that other variants, such as MV.1, which also presents the T22N mutation, are being monitored. MV.1 was identified in India at the end of June and quickly spread, becoming a variant to be observed in the future. The dynamics of coronavirus variants continue to be a concern for public health, as the virus naturally evolves.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 01:26 AM\nSource:[Olhar Digital](https://olhardigital.com.br/2024/09/23/medicina-e-saude/xec-a-nova-variante-do-coronavirus-que-pode-se-espalhar-pelo-mundo)\n\n**Is the hybrid COVID variant XEC in the US? What to know about the new strain that's more contagious**\nThe hybrid COVID-19 strain XEC, a recombinant of the Omicron variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, has been reported in at least 25 US states, according to RTI International epidemiologist Joëlla W. Adams. While there's no indication that XEC will increase the severity of the virus, it could potentially become a dominant strain due to its increased contagiousness. However, current COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots are effective against XEC as it is a hybrid of two Omicron strains. Adams said, 'We often use what happens in Europe as a good indication of what might happen here.' The CDC continues to monitor the emergence of variants in the population and recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the virus.

According to the BBC, the new variant, a sub-variant of 'Omicron', began spreading in Berlin, Germany in June, and quickly spread to other parts of Europe, North America, and Asia. By September, the variant had been detected in 27 countries, including Germany, Poland, Luxembourg, Norway, Ukraine, China, Denmark, the UK, Portugal, and the Netherlands. According to Russia Today, the new variant has some new mutations that help it spread quickly, making it a hybrid of the previously discovered sub-variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3 of the 'Omicron' strain. Dr. Joanne Waldstreicher, an infectious disease expert, said, 'The new XEC variant is more transmissible than other variants, but the available COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are effective against it.' However, the variant may become the dominant strain, as Omicron variants are the most contagious. Nevertheless, the available COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are effective against the new XEC variant, which is a hybrid of two Omicron sub-variants. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to monitor the spread of the variant, and recommends that everyone aged 6 months and older receive the updated COVID-19 vaccine for the 2024-2025 season, regardless of previous vaccination or infection status. 'The new XEC variant is more transmissible than other variants, but the available COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are effective against it,' said Dr. Joanne Waldstreicher. 'Like other respiratory infections, COVID-19 and its new variants will spread more during the fall and winter seasons as students return to school and spend more time indoors, and visit family for holidays.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 22, 2024 12:07 PM\nSource:[Shorouk News](https://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=22092024&id=780cb563-4b84-4745-be12-51650c84a847)\n\n**New Covid-19 Variant XEC: A Potential Next Dominant Strain?**\nThe new Covid-19 variant XEC has been identified in Germany in June 2024 and is considered by some experts as the next dominant variant.

Mike Honey, a data scientist, reports that XEC has increased in 27 countries across three continents, with strong growth in Denmark and Germany (16-17%), the UK and Netherlands (11-13%). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that a limited number of XEC detections have been reported in Europe, and it is too early to evaluate the variant's transmissibility, severity, or vaccine efficacy. The ECDC estimates that XEC will have similar characteristics to its cousins currently in circulation, and that the current vaccines will remain effective. Dr. Eric Topol estimates that it will take several weeks or months for XEC to become established and cause a new wave of infections. The ECDC is monitoring the situation closely, and vaccination remains the best protection against Covid-19.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 22, 2024 03:02 AM\nSource:[Midi Libre](https://www.midilibre.fr/2024/09/22/covid-19-faut-il-sinquieter-du-nouveau-variant-xec-qui-pourrait-etre-a-lorigine-dune-nouvelle-vague-12208388.php)\n\n**New COVID-19 variant making its way to California: What to know about XEC variant**\nA new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has been spreading rapidly across multiple countries, including the United States and California.
