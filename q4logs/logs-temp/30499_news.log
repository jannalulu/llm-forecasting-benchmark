The cold front will bring some moisture to the northern edge of the state, with a chance of rain and snow showers in the highest elevations. Cooler air will settle in after the frontal passage, with highs dropping to the middle 70s on Wednesday and Thursday. Thanksgiving afternoon temperatures will reach around 74 in Phoenix, near 50 in Show Low, and near 60 in Payson.

So, remember to pack your patience and expect to spend extended time in your vehicle getting to and from snow play areas,' said the Arizona Department of Transportation.

**Phoenix's extreme heat is a warning for all of us**
The extreme heat in the Southwest, particularly in Phoenix, Arizona, is a life-and-death matter for millions of Americans. The region has experienced unprecedented heat waves in 2024, largely due to human-caused climate change. The heat has devastating effects on people's quality of life, with many suffering from heat-related illnesses, including death. Amy Dishion, whose husband Evan died from heat while hiking, said, 'I lost my partner in life and my favorite person and the father of my child to extreme heat because he went on a hike during hot weather.' Hazel Chandler, an Arizona field organizer for Moms Clean Air Force, lives with stage-four cancer and has to take precautions when going outside due to the heat. Lisa Materna and her husband moved to a single-story home to escape the heat, but still find it too hot to unpack. According to Juan Declet-Barreto, a senior social scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, climate change is threatening water resources, increasing challenges to food and fiber production, and compromising human health in the Southwest. The region is not warming faster than other parts of the country, but the extreme heat will test human adaptability to its limits. Peter W. Reiners, a professor of Geosciences at the University of Arizona, said, 'The human toll and threat of massive geopolitical disruption from its increasing frequency and intensity is a truly scary prospect.'

Temperatures will gradually drop next week, but the triple digits are still in the forecast until the week of October 7th. The drought has been worsening over the past few months, with only a few days left to get rain in the buckets before the monsoon season officially ends on September 30th. Phoenix has only picked up 0.74 inches of rain this monsoon season, compared to the 30-year average of 2.43 inches. 'It's likely that we'll continue to mark the latest 110-degree day on record all the way through October 1st,' said the weather forecast. 'We do not anticipate any 90-degree lows, but even the low to mid 80s are exceptionally warm for this time of year.'
