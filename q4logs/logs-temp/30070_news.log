**US Plans to Increase Nuclear Arsenal Amid Growing Threats**
The United States is considering increasing its nuclear arsenal in response to growing threats from China, Russia, and North Korea. According to the Wall Street Journal, citing high-ranking officials in the Biden administration, the final decision will be made by the new administration of Donald Trump, who won the recent presidential election. 'The US must be prepared to expand its nuclear forces to prevent growing threats from China, Russia, and North Korea,' the article states. However, the exact plans for Trump's defense policy have not been announced. One of the reasons for the US to reconsider its nuclear strategy is the active buildup of military power by China and North Korea, as well as the suspension of dialogue with Russia on arms control, including the Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive Arms. Trump's return to the White House may signal a new wave of development of the country's nuclear potential. The US nuclear arsenal consists of nuclear warheads in the country's armed forces.

**Ukraine: Media Reports Nuclear Missile Ready Soon, But Kiev Denies 'No Plan'**
A nuclear threat has emerged in the diplomatic skirmishes surrounding the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, just before Donald Trump's presidential mandate. The nuclear threat is resurfacing, despite the new US administration not yet being fully in place (Trump will become president with full powers in January). Trump has already stated in Florida, 'The war between Russia and Ukraine must end.' However, this statement does not seem to be reflected in the actions of the Russian military, as they are reportedly preparing to deploy a nuclear-capable cruise missile, the Burevestnik. Kiev has denied any plans for a nuclear attack, saying 'there is no plan'.

**White House official sees possibility of DPRK nuclear test soon**
White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan believes that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) may hold a nuclear test soon, possibly before the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump. Sullivan stated, 'I do not think we can count on a period of quiet with the DPRK. Obviously, they've continued their ballistic missile testing just in recent days and weeks. The possibility of a seventh nuclear test remains ever present.' Sullivan noted that transition periods in the US have historically been times when the DPRK takes provocative actions, and the US will be 'watching every day between now and January 20' for any signs of a test.

**New Nuclear Arms Race: Is the World Ready?**
The world is entering a new nuclear arms race. Tensions between major powers are at a high point, reminiscent of the Cold War era. Experts believe that this new nuclear arms race will be even more dangerous than the previous one. With Russian leader Vladimir Putin's threats in Ukraine, China's accelerated arms program, and the US's desire for superiority, what will it take for leaders to step back from the brink? Is the world ready to face the threat of nuclear weapons? In the past, the US and the Soviet Union took significant steps to reduce nuclear armament. After years of difficult negotiations, measures were taken to limit short, medium, and long-range nuclear attack and defense weapons. As a result, the total number of nuclear weapons in the hands of the two countries decreased from 600,000 to around 11 million, under control.

**Are we about to see an Iranian nuclear test?**
Iran may be considering a nuclear test in response to increased pressure from the US, according to top officials in the Iranian government. Mohammad-Javad Zarif, the Iranian President's strategic deputy and former foreign minister, stated that Iran may elevate its uranium enrichment to 60% and increase the number of centrifuges in response to the US's maximum pressure strategy. Iranian member of parliament Ahmad Naderi posted on X that a nuclear test and formal announcement should not be delayed, and former foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi suggested that Iran may reconsider the Supreme Leader's ruling against weapons of mass destruction in response to existential threats. Iran is also signaling that it will not limit itself to attacks on Israel if the situation in the Middle East worsens. The US must consider the possibility that Iran will not wait for a new administration to take power and may conduct a nuclear test before January 2025.

**Why nuclear weapons will be on Trump's agenda**
President-elect Donald Trump will face significant nuclear threats from Russia, China, and Iran when he takes office in January. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has been modernizing his nuclear forces and has rejected talks with Washington on replacing New START, the last US-Russia arms limitation pact. China is building up its strategic nuclear forces, with estimates suggesting it will have 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035. Iran may decide to build nuclear weapons following tit-for-tat strikes with Israel and the failure to revive major power talks on restoring curbs on its nuclear programme. Trump will have to craft a policy on deterring nuclear threats from these countries, while also confronting the expiration of New START and the soaring costs of America's own modernisation of its nuclear 'triad'.

**Angela Rayner has spoken to US Vice President-elect JD Vance about 'plans for the future'**
UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has spoken to US Vice President-elect JD Vance about their plans for the future. Rayner posted on X that it was 'good to speak' to Vance, and they discussed how to build on the special relationship between the UK and the US. This comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer extended 'hearty congratulations' to President-elect Trump, and ahead of the inauguration on January 20, 2025. Rayner has previously labelled Trump an 'absolute buffoon' for his management of the Covid pandemic, and dismissed Vance's assertion that the UK is a 'truly Islamist' country armed with nuclear weapons.

**Trump’s Win Could Unleash Global Chaos**
Donald Trump's potential return to the White House in January 2025, combined with a Republican-led U.S. Senate, is feared by international allies and welcomed by some of America's foes. Trump is likely to try to force a ceasefire in Ukraine, possibly involving a permanent settlement that acknowledges Russia's territorial gains. He may also accept demands from Vladimir Putin to prevent Ukraine's NATO membership. In the Middle East, Trump is expected to double down on his support for Israel and Saudi Arabia, taking a tougher line on Iran. This could lead to a widening of the conflict in Lebanon and a potentially devastating strike against Iran. Relations with China are likely to be characterized by continuity, with Trump increasing import tariffs and potentially making pragmatic deals with Xi Jinping. However, Trump's commitment to defending Taiwan and other treaty allies in Asia is uncertain, and his unpredictability makes it possible that he would accept a nuclear-armed North Korea as part of a broader deal with Russia. This could give Trump additional leverage over China, but also strain relations between the U.S. and its allies in all three regions.

**Iran Warns of 'Strong and Complex' Response to Israel, May Use 'More Powerful' Weapons**
Iran is warning through diplomatic channels that it is preparing a military response to Israel, which could involve the use of 'more powerful' weapons, according to an Egyptian official quoted by The Wall Street Journal. The warning comes after Israel's recent airstrikes against Iranian military installations, which destroyed strategic air defenses and killed five people. Iran has so far refrained from attacking Israel's essential oil and nuclear facilities, but that calculation could change, according to Israeli officials. 'A strong and complex response is being prepared,' said an Iranian official, as quoted by WSJ. 'Our military lost people, so we need to respond.' Iran may use Iraqi territory as part of the operation and could attack Israeli military installations 'in a much more aggressive way than last time,' according to officials. The response will not be limited to missiles and drones, as in previous attacks, and any missiles used could have more powerful warheads, officials said. The Iranian response is being delayed until after the US presidential elections on Tuesday, to avoid influencing the outcome, and will occur before the new president is inaugurated in January 2025. Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian has conditioned the intensity and type of the response to a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon. 'If they (the Israelis) reconsider their behavior, accept a ceasefire, and stop massacring the oppressed and innocent people of the region, it could affect the intensity and type of our response,' Pezeshkian said in a cabinet meeting, according to IRNA.

**ANALYSIS: Trump is going to win BIG, and then the real fireworks begin… America won’t survive as we know it for even ONE YEAR**
The author predicts a catastrophic scenario in the United States if Donald Trump wins the election. They claim that the Democratic Party will try to cheat and rig the election, but the Fifth Circuit's decision on mail-in ballots will put a damper on their plan. Once Trump is declared the winner, the author expects the radical Left to unleash violence and chaos across America, including activating millions of military-aged males who have illegally crossed the border. The author also predicts that the USA and NATO may initiate a nuclear exchange with Russia, and that there is a strong possibility of a nuclear false flag detonation on US soil. The author believes that the Democrats will try to block Trump's certification on January 6th, 2025, and that martial law may be declared, leading to civil war. The author also predicts that the US dollar will collapse, leading to hyperinflation and food scarcity. They urge Americans to prepare for chaos and to get to a red county in a red state before the situation escalates. The author also mentions a scenario where Biden resigns before January 6th and Kamala becomes president, and that Democrats will block Trump from being certified, leading to martial law and civil war. They also mention a poll that shows almost half of Americans think a civil war is likely, and that a former CIA advisor warns that the US is headed for civil war. The author also mentions a Congressman who predicts a possible civil war in January 2025, and that a lawyer and economist who worked at the highest levels of Wall Street and international finance warns that the stakes are high and that Americans need to prepare.

**Russian Schools to Require Armed Security Personnel from 2025**
From January 1, 2025, the Russian Rosstandart will enforce new regulations requiring private security personnel (ЧОП) working in schools to carry firearms and body armor during emergencies. According to Anton Shalaev, head of Rosstandart, 'The new standard will increase the level of protection for educational institutions and ensure the safety of students and teachers.' However, critics argue that the new regulations will be difficult for schools to implement, as they will have to bear the costs of purchasing firearms and equipment. As Mikhail Avdeenko, deputy chairman of the All-Russian Trade Union of Education, noted, 'It's likely that the salary of a security guard who meets all the requirements of the new standard and has the necessary licenses will be higher.' The new regulations are mandatory for all educational state organizations that hire private security companies through government procurement.

**China's Nuclear Arsenal to Exceed 1,000 by 2030, Potentially Destabilizing Global Security**
China's nuclear arsenal is growing rapidly, and according to a new report by the US Defense Intelligence Agency, this number could exceed 1,000 in the next six years. The report states that China is expanding its nuclear capabilities in view of its strategic and security interests. This includes advanced systems such as missile silos, ground-mobile, submarine-launched, and nuclear-capable hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs). According to The Week, China's nuclear stockpile could double by 2030, potentially destabilizing global security. Currently, China has over 500 operational nuclear warheads, and the report suggests that most of these warheads will be capable of targeting mainland America. China's nuclear power status SIPRI's report states that as of January 2024, China had 500 nuclear warheads, up from 410 in 2023. By January this year, the total number of nuclear warheads worldwide was 12,221, with 9,585 potentially usable. Russia and the US have over 90% of the world's nuclear weapons, with China in third place. Other countries, such as Britain, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel, are also modernizing their arsenals. However, China's nuclear warhead stockpile is still significantly lower than that of Russia and the US, but the rapidly increasing capability could lead to a shift in the global security balance.

**China's Nuclear Arsenal to Surpass 1,000 Operational Weapons by 2030**
China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and is expected to surpass 1,000 operational nuclear weapons in the next six years, according to a report by the US Defense Intelligence Agency. The report, titled 'Nuclear Challenges: Growing Capabilities of Strategic Rivals and Regional Adversaries,' states that China is developing a new series of nuclear capabilities, including the construction of the largest nuclear missile silo. China is modernizing its nuclear arsenal for strategic ambitions and security interests, with a focus on nuclear missiles, including ground-mobile, submarine-launched, and hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs). The report estimates that China's nuclear arsenal will double by 2030, with an estimated 1,000 operational nuclear weapons, most of which will be capable of reaching mainland America. China is also developing fully new nuclear capabilities, including ICBM-range nuclear-armed HGVs, some of which will be deployed in the near future, if not already deployed. According to the report, China's nuclear stockpile has increased from 410 in January 2023 to 500 in January 2024. The report also states that the US, Russia, Britain, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel are all modernizing their nuclear arsenals. The report estimates that there are 12,221 nuclear warheads in the world, with 9,585 potentially usable for deployment. Russia and the US possess 90% of the world's nuclear stockpile, with each having over 5,000 nuclear warheads. China's nuclear stockpile is significantly smaller compared to Russia and the US.

**US Enters State of Enhanced Security Ahead of Elections**
The United States has entered a state of enhanced security measures ahead of the elections, which will continue until the presidential inauguration on January 20, 2025, according to local media reports. The measures include deploying more police officers, using bulletproof vests, and drones to monitor the environment, which has become increasingly hostile for many. The process of electing a president in the US has become more risky since the 2020 campaign, when then-President Donald Trump promoted theories of massive electoral fraud and claimed that his victory was stolen from him by Democrat Joe Biden. Trump's supporters reacted with violence, attacking the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, during a joint session of Congress attempting to certify the election results. Many election officials have chosen to recuse themselves from this cycle, and those who remain will receive increased protection. In Washington D.C., Police Chief Pamela Smith announced that she has recruited around 4,000 national agents who will take an oath to help with inauguration security. Mayor Muriel Bowser also updated the city council on security plans from election day to the next president's inauguration. The reinforcement in the US capital may include the possibility of National Guard troops. 'We haven't submitted a request yet, but we've been actively involved with the Department of Defense and how that planning is carried out,' Bowser said. The collective memory is fearful of another post-election debacle like the one three years ago, which left five dead, over 140 police officers injured, and ongoing investigations and convictions. Trump has suggested that if he returns to the White House, he may pardon all those behind bars for their involvement in the incident. The 2024 election cycle has not been exempt from extraordinary events, including two attempts on Trump's life between July and September.

**Taiwan Promises to Ditch Nuclear Power by 2025, But AI-Driven Energy Demand May Change Course**
Taiwan has promised to have no nuclear power plants in operation by 2025. However, the growing demand for energy, driven by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), is leading the country to reconsider its energy model. The energy nuclear, a non-renewable source that is being phased out in Taiwan, is once again being considered as a promising alternative to meet the increasing demand caused by AI. Indications of a change in direction. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Taiwanese Prime Minister Cho Jung-tai said he is 'very open' to nuclear energy. 'As long as there is a consensus within Taiwan on nuclear safety and good direction and guarantees for nuclear waste management, with this strong consensus, we can have a public discussion,' he said. The support for the use of nuclear reactors fell in 2011, just after Japan was hit by the earthquake that caused the Fukushima accident. Cho did not provide many details about his position, but noted that he expects his country to be able to keep up 'with global trends and new nuclear technologies.' The mention of 'new technologies' is not a minor detail. In fact, it is a key point that may favor the resurgence of nuclear energy in the island. We are witnessing the evolution of nuclear reactors live. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), like those that Google and Amazon want to use, promise to be less complex, but also more versatile, efficient, and safe. 'No nuclear' nation by 2025. Between 1977 and 1985, Taiwan had managed to put six nuclear reactors into operation, but things changed over time. This number did not increase, but rather decreased gradually. According to the Nuclear Safety Commission, the country had three nuclear power plants operated by the state-owned Taipower in January of this year. Two of them, Chinshan and Kuosheng, were in the process of being dismantled, while Maanshan was still operating, but had its days numbered. The government has been developing a policy of gradual elimination of nuclear energy with a deadline of 2025. But all this takes place in a complex scenario. On the one hand, Taiwan is on its way to becoming the first non-nuclear state in East Asia, a decision supported in some way by a referendum held in 2021 where the majority of voters rejected the possibility of restarting the construction of the two advanced reactors that had begun to be built, but whose project was suspended. Taiwan essentially depends on imported energy. The island imports around 97.73% of its energy needs. The goal of de-nuclearizing is accompanied by achieving an energy mix consisting of 50% liquefied natural gas (LNG), 27% coal, and 15% renewable energies. But this plan also has challenges, mainly from an environmental point of view. It is a fact that more energy is needed, but also that the different actors in the country must help reduce their emissions. In this point is where the rise of AI enters the scene, where several countries compete to lead its development. Taiwan has a leading role in this world. In the island, large language models like those of OpenAI, Microsoft or Google are not trained, but many of the advanced chips needed for this industry are manufactured. Let us remember that we are talking about the home of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which has chip manufacturing plants for clients like NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm, among others.

**Nobel Peace Prize 2024: SIPRI Highlights Importance of Maintaining Nuclear Taboo**
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has emphasized the importance of maintaining the nuclear taboo, stating that 'the Hibakusha and organizations like Nihon Hidankyo play a crucial role'. The institute's director, Dan Smith, said, 'It is of utmost importance that we maintain the nuclear taboo. The Hibakusha and organizations like Nihon Hidankyo play a crucial role'. Nihon Hidankyo, a confederation of organizations of Hibakusha, the survivors of the atomic bombs dropped by the United States on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 2024. The SIPRI noted that 'the number and types of nuclear weapons in development have increased as states deepen their dependence on nuclear deterrence'. The institute also mentioned that 'of the nine nuclear-armed states, continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals and several deployed new nuclear-capable systems or systems in 2023'. Additionally, 'of the total global inventory of approximately 12,121 warheads in January 2024, approximately 9,585 were in military stockpiles for possible use. It is estimated that 3,904 of those warheads were deployed with missiles and aircraft (60 more than in January 2023) and the rest were in central storage. Around 2,100 of the deployed warheads were maintained in a high operational alert state on ballistic missiles. Almost all these warheads belonged to Russia or the United States, but for the first time, it is believed that China has some warheads in high operational alert state'.

**Nuclear Powers to Meet in New York Amid Ukraine Tensions**
According to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, the five nuclear powers - the US, Russia, China, France, and the UK - will meet in two weeks in New York to discuss the tense situation in Ukraine. Ryabkov stated, 'The meeting will take place due to the nuclear tensions since the Ukraine war.' The meeting is a response to President Vladimir Putin's announcement last month to revise the Russian nuclear doctrine, which could lead to the consideration of using nuclear weapons in certain scenarios. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken criticized Putin's statement as 'completely irresponsible.' China, a key ally of Russia, also warned Putin against using nuclear weapons, citing the risks of a nuclear war. In January 2022, the five nuclear powers issued a joint statement, stating that preventing a war between nuclear powers and reducing strategic risks are their top priorities. They emphasized, 'We reaffirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.'

**Amid Nuclear Tensions Between Russia And The West, A Top Meeting In New York**
A top-level meeting between the 'nuclear five' - Russia, the United States, China, France, and Britain - will take place in New York within the next two weeks, according to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov.

This development is significant, given that the 'nuclear five' previously issued a joint statement in January 2022, emphasizing the avoidance of war between nuclear powers and the reduction of strategic risks. As they stated at the time, 'We affirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.'

**North Korea & War By 2025**
North Korea has threatened to use nuclear weapons if the US threatens its sovereignty, and is removing references to reconciliation with South Korea from its Constitution. Our model on Korea predicts that the 72-year Revolutionary Cycle will turn up in 2025, coinciding with rising tensions in the region. The US has been pushing against China, with Blinken turning the screws on China in January 2023, and Pelosi's trip to Taiwan in August 2022 set off rising tensions. The article suggests that American Neocons have a lifelong hatred of China and Russia, and are guilty of the sins of the previous generation. The US dollar is poised to rally against the won in 2025, making this a hot spot to pay close attention to.

**Iran Will Not Engage in Military Action Against Israel Before Completing First 5 Nuclear Bombs in 2025**
Major General Samir Faraj, a military expert, denied any agreement between Iran and the US to hand over Hassan Nasrallah, saying, 'I strongly disagree with this, I am against it completely, and it's possible that his role has ended, but Iran has not handed him over to the US.' He predicted that the response from Hezbollah would be serious this time after the assassination of Nasrallah, while also criticizing the US for denying any knowledge of the operation. Faraj pointed out that a team from the US Department of Defense, the Pentagon, was present in the operations room of the Israeli occupation army's command. He emphasized that Iran will not take any military action against Israel in the near future, saying, 'Iran will not engage in any military action in the near future, despite reports by some American media outlets about Iran's intention to retaliate, but I confirm that it will not intervene against Israel and will maintain its stance, because next year 2025, it will have completed its first 5 nuclear bombs.' He explained that any military action by Iran would expose its nuclear reactor to Israeli targeting, adding, 'Politics is a game of interests, and Iran's goal for 2025 is to possess nuclear weapons,' citing its past avoidance of responding to Israeli aggression.

**Putin Announces Review of Russia's Nuclear Doctrine Ahead of Zelensky's Visit to Washington**
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a review of Russia's nuclear doctrine before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to Washington. Putin warned that Russia may use nuclear weapons in case of a 'massive launch' of aircraft, missiles, or drones against its territory. 'We will consider this possibility if we receive reliable information about the massive launch of aerospace attack means and their crossing of our state's border,' Putin said. Putin assured that Russia has always had a 'very responsible approach' to these issues, but the current military and political situation is 'very dynamic' and must be taken into account. 'This includes the emergence of new sources of threats and military risks to Russia and its allies,' Putin added. Since the start of the conflict in Ukraine in February 2022, Putin has insisted on the possible use of nuclear weapons. Russia's nuclear doctrine provides for the use of atomic weapons 'strictly in a defensive manner' in case of an attack on Russia with mass destruction weapons or in case of conventional aggression 'threatening the very existence of the state.' Russia deployed tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus in 2023, its closest ally, which also announced in May a coordinated exercise with Moscow to verify its tactical nuclear launchers.
