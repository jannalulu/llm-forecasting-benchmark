**Flu surveillance flags probable H5 avian flu case in Delaware**
Routine flu surveillance in Delaware flagged a probable H5 avian flu case, which was later confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a probable case. The CDC has now reported seven probable cases, with six involving people who had exposure to cows or poultry. In other developments, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed 7 more outbreaks in dairy cattle in California, raising the state's total to 645 and the national total to 860 across 16 states. APHIS also added two more confirmations in poultry flocks and five more H5N1 detections in mammals, including a house mouse, a domestic cat, and two mountain lions. Labcorp announced the launch of its molecular test for the virus in people, which can be used to assess potential human exposure.

**Galveston County confirms first Avian Influenza ‘Bird Flu’ case in Texas City bird**
The Galveston County Health District has confirmed the first case of Avian Influenza (H5N1) in Texas City, Texas. A bird displaying 'erratic behavior' was reported on December 5 and tested positive for H5N1 after dying. Two animal control officers who responded to the incident reported experiencing symptoms, but were later confirmed to be negative for the virus. According to the CDC, H5N1 can cause symptoms in humans, particularly those who work with poultry, waterfowl, and livestock. The CDC has confirmed 60 total reported human cases in the U.S. across 49 states, with a low public health risk. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has ordered the testing of the U.S. milk supply for H5N1. The CDC advises people who believe they may have been exposed to H5N1 to contact their local health department immediately.

**Experts sound alarm as more human bird flu cases are reported**
The bird flu virus, or H5N1, has spread significantly in the past few months, with 60 confirmed cases in Americans and 845 dairy herds affected, along with nearly 123 million birds. Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician, warns that the virus has not burned itself out and continues to spread, infecting humans. The CDC has not yet reached the status of a public health emergency, but officials are concerned about the virus's potential to adapt to mammals and acquire the necessary evolutionary genetic changes for human-to-human transmission. The CDC is considering amping up its detection system and is hesitant to launch a vaccination campaign, citing the effectiveness of current medications and vaccines. Dr. Nirav Shah, the principal deputy director of the CDC, emphasizes the importance of trust-building and says that the agency is working to secure the dairy cattle population from the virus. Some scientists are calling for vaccination of high-risk populations, such as farmworkers, and for the government to adopt an 'Operation Warp Speed' mindset to contain the spread and avoid a pandemic. 'We have to really ask ourselves, what are we getting from the vaccination,' Shah said. 'What if we offer a vaccine but no one takes it? Then what have we really done to keep a lid on the virus?'

**¿Qué está pasando con la gripe aviar H5N1 en Estados Unidos? 'Estamos seguros de que habrá otra pandemia'**
The H5N1 avian flu is a concern. US health authorities have reported the detection of the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus in 668 dairy cattle farms in 15 states. There have been 58 human cases diagnosed. Dr. Francisco Javier Membrillo, vice president and communication officer of the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SEIMC), says that 'we are sure that there will be another pandemic' and that 'the H5N1 avian flu is the most likely disease to cause a pandemic'. He notes that 'the virus has been mutating and getting closer to animals that are immunologically similar to humans'. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report daily on the epidemiological situation of the H5N1 avian flu. Since February 25, 2024, over 65,000 samples have been analyzed. The CDC reports that there are 58 confirmed human cases in the US, with California having the most cases, 31, with an unknown source of exposure. The risk is considered low in Spain, but the country is prepared to face the virus with tests to detect H5N1. The current flu vaccine does not protect against H5N1. The CDC notes that the virus can spread from animals to humans in several ways, and the symptoms are similar to those of seasonal flu.

**US Orders Nationwide Test for Avian Influenza in Unpasteurized Milk**
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has ordered a nationwide test for avian influenza virus in unpasteurized milk to prevent the spread of H5N1 avian influenza. The test will start on December 16 and will initially be implemented in six states: California, Colorado, Michigan, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and Oregon. USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack said, 'This testing plan will give us the opportunity to detect early signs of an outbreak or a potential outbreak in a state.' USDA Chief Veterinarian Rosemary Sifford said, 'The frequency of testing will be determined by whether the initial sampling detects the virus or not.' According to USDA data, over 700 dairy cows in 15 states have been infected with H5N1 avian influenza since the first case was reported in March, with over 500 cases concentrated in California. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that nearly 60 people have been infected with H5N1 virus since April, mostly farm workers, but CDC stated that symptoms are mostly mild and pose a low risk to public health.

**CDC A(H5N1) Bird Flu Response Update November 18, 2024**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to respond to the multistate outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in the United States. Since April 2024, CDC has confirmed 52 human cases of H5N1 bird flu, with 21 cases associated with exposure to infected poultry and 30 cases associated with exposure to infected dairy cows. The source of exposure in one case could not be determined. All recent cases have occurred in workers on affected farms, with mild symptoms such as eye redness or discharge. CDC believes the immediate risk to the general public from H5 bird flu remains low, but people with exposure to infected animals are at higher risk of infection. The CDC recommends oseltamivir for treatment of patients with H5N1 and for post-exposure prophylaxis of close contacts of confirmed H5N1 patients. Influenza genetic sequence data from recent cases have been posted in GISAID and GenBank. CDC continues to support states in monitoring people with exposure to infected animals and has tested over 7,300 people as a result of their exposure. More than 60,000 specimens have been tested for avian influenza A(H5) virus or other novel influenza viruses at public health labs.

**First Bird Flu Case in a Child Reported in California**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported the first case of H5N1 influenza in a child in California, bringing the total number of human infections in the U.S. this year to 55. The child had mild symptoms and was treated with flu antiviral medication. According to the CDC, 'there were low levels of viral material detected in the initial specimen collected, and follow-up testing of the child several days later was negative for H5 bird flu but was positive for other common respiratory viruses.' An investigation is ongoing to determine how the child may have been exposed to H5N1 influenza. All household members tested negative for bird flu, but some family members tested positive for the same respiratory viruses as the child.

**First Reported Case of Child Infected with H5N1 Avian Flu in the US**
The first reported case of a child being infected with the H5N1 avian flu virus in the United States has been detected. The minor, from California, showed only mild symptoms and was treated with an antiviral medication. According to the US CDC, all tests on family members have come back negative. An investigation is underway to determine where the child was infected. To date, 55 confirmed cases of H5N1 infection have been reported in the US, with most in California. The CDC notes that while the virus is widespread among wild birds globally and has infected many wild mammals, the risk to the general population is considered low. 'The CDC is continuing to evaluate the risk to the general population as being low,' said the CDC. However, the agency has reported cases primarily among dairy and poultry farm employees, with mild symptoms. Interhuman transmission has not yet been proven.

**US Reports First Case of Avian Flu in a Child**
US health authorities reported a case of avian flu in a child living in California, marking the first recorded case of a minor in the country. The child, whose age was not disclosed, is recovering from the illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) investigated the possible source of the child's exposure to H5N1, but it has not been identified yet. The child's family members reported symptoms, so samples were collected from each of them, which tested negative for avian flu. 'Contact tracing continues, but currently, there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission of the H5N1 avian flu from this child to others,' the CDC stated in a press release. This is the second case detected through the virus surveillance program in the US. The CDC continues to closely monitor the available data, particularly in states affected by animal outbreaks, including California, where cases of avian flu H5N1 have been detected in wild birds and domestic poultry since 2022, as well as in dairy herds since August 2024. The CDC noted that limited and sporadic human infections with the H5N1 avian flu virus, where animal exposure was not identified, are rare but have occurred, mainly in countries other than the US. Including this recent case, 55 human cases of avian flu have been reported in the US in 2024, with 29 of them in California. In April, the first case of H5N1 was detected in Texas, where a farm worker tested positive after being exposed to contaminated cows. The virus, identified as H5N1, is a highly contagious subtype of avian flu among birds. The CDC stated that there are no signs that this virus has evolved to spread rapidly among people.

**First US Case of Avian Influenza in Over 15 Years Detected in Child**
A case of avian influenza (H5N1) has been detected in a child in the Alameda County, near San Francisco, marking the first case in the US in over 15 years. The child, who is experiencing mild symptoms, has been treated with antiviral medication at home and is not considered contagious. The child's family members have also tested negative for the virus. As a precaution, local authorities have offered testing and preventive treatment to employees and other children at the daycare center attended by the child. Tomas Aragon, Director of Health Services in California, stated, 'It is natural that people are concerned, but we want to assure parents, employees, and families that, based on the information and data we have, we do not believe the child was contagious.' He added, 'No cases of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza have been documented in any country in over 15 years.' The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that, including this recent case, 55 human cases of avian influenza (sub-type) H5 have been reported in the US in 2024, with 29 in California.

**California Child Becomes First Pediatric Case of Avian Flu H5N1 in the US**
A child in California has become the first pediatric case of avian flu H5N1 in the United States. Although all household members were evaluated, only the child tested positive. The California Department of Public Health and the CDC are investigating the source of exposure, ruling out, for now, person-to-person transmission. The child is recovering. This case is part of the 55 human cases of avian flu H5N1 reported in 2024, with 29 cases in California. The CDC is monitoring bird outbreaks in wild, domestic, and dairy herds since 2022, with a focus on affected states like California and Texas. While human infections are rare, active surveillance aims to prevent the spread of the virus. 'The sub-type of avian flu H5N1 is highly contagious among birds, but its transmission between humans remains limited and sporadic,' said the CDC. 'There is no evidence that the virus has evolved to spread easily among people, so we are focusing on preventing future cases and reinforcing safety measures in vulnerable populations.'

**US Reports First Case of Avian Flu in a Child**
US health authorities announced a rare case of avian flu in a child in the San Francisco Bay Area, marking the first detection of the H5N1 virus in a child in the United States. The child, living in Alameda County, has mild symptoms and is receiving antiviral treatment at home. Tests showed a low level of the virus, suggesting low contagiousness. A follow-up test four days later was negative, and the child's family members were not infected. As a precaution, authorities offered tests and preventive treatments to people in contact with the child at their daycare. Dr. Tomas Aragon, California's public health director, reassured the public, stating that no human-to-human transmission of avian flu has been documented in over 15 years. This case comes in the context of an increase in H5N1 infections in various animal species since 2020, including recently in US dairy cattle. Although the public health risk is considered low, it is higher for people in professional contact with livestock. The CDC reports that this new case brings the total number of human infections with the H5 virus in the US to 55 in 2024, with 29 in California. Experts remain vigilant about the possibility of a virus mutation that could facilitate human-to-human transmission, despite the current rarity of human cases.

**First Pediatric Case of H5N1 Avian Influenza in the US**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Cdc) have confirmed a human infection with the A H5N1 virus in a child in California. The child, who experienced mild symptoms, received antiviral flu medication and is recovering. An investigation by the California Department of Public Health (Cdph) is underway to determine the possible source of the child's exposure to the H5N1 virus. The child's family members have also been tested and found to be negative for the H5N1 virus, but positive for common respiratory viruses. 'To date, no person-to-person transmission of H5N1 avian influenza has been identified in any of the cases reported in the United States,' said the Cdc. This case was detected through flu testing and reported to the California department through the national influenza surveillance system. It is the second human case identified in the US. The Cdc continues to monitor the data, particularly in states affected by animal epidemics, such as California, where widespread outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza have been detected in wild birds and domestic poultry since 2022 and in dairy herds since August 2024. 'These cases highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance and investigations at the local, state, and federal levels,' said the experts. Including this recent case, there have been 55 human cases of H5 avian influenza reported in the US in 2024, with 29 in California. The Cdc's risk assessment for the general public remains 'low.' However, people exposed to infected or potentially infected animals, such as birds, dairy cattle, or other animals, or to contaminated environments, are at higher risk of infection. The Cdc recommends avoiding unprotected exposure to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domestic birds, and other wild or domestic animals (including cows).

**US Avian Flu Cases Rise to 53, Raising Concerns of Another Pandemic**
The number of human cases of avian flu in the US has risen to at least 53 this week, with new cases of H5N1 infection reported in California and Oregon. The continued spread of the virus, which has affected 30% of California's dairy herds, is raising concerns about the country's response and increasing the potential threat of another pandemic. The CDC has been criticized for its slow response, with the director of South Africa's Epidemic Response and Innovation Center saying that he is 'watching its spread with horror' and calling it a 'grave pandemic threat.' 'However, the US response seems inadequate and slow; very few genomic sequences of H5N1 cases in farm animals have been made available to the public for scientific review,' Dr. Tulio de Oliveira wrote. 'The failure to control H5N1 among US livestock could have global consequences, and this demands urgent attention. The US has done little to assure the world that it has the outbreak under control.' Despite reports of additional infections in agricultural workers and Canadian health authorities saying that a teenager was left in critical condition after infection, officials have maintained that the risk to the public remains low. The CDC has assured that they are closely monitoring the situation. However, scientists have reported that the virus that infected the Canadian teenager underwent mutations that would make that version of H5N1 more easily transmissible to humans. But there is no evidence that it infected anyone else. Meanwhile, in the US, cases have increased in humans and animals, with Hawaii reporting its first outbreak in backyard chickens on a farm, and the agency also noted that genomic sequencing of cases in poultry farms in Washington had shed light on a change that could reduce the susceptibility of flu viruses to antiviral drugs like Tamiflu.

**Remember the swine flu pandemic of 2009? Well, H5N1 bird flu could be next**
The number of human bird flu cases in the US has climbed to at least 53, with new infections reported in California and Oregon. The spread of the virus, which has affected 30% of California's dairy herds, is sparking fears about the nation's response and the possible threat of another pandemic. Dr. Tulio de Oliveira, director of the Center for Epidemic Response and Innovation, has called the US response 'inadequate and slow,' citing a lack of genomic sequences of H5N1 cases in farm animals. However, officials maintain that the risk to the public remains low, and the CDC is monitoring the situation carefully. Scientists have noted that the virus has undergone mutational changes that could make it easier to infect people, but there is no evidence that it has infected anyone else. The CDC has also identified a change in genetic sequencing from cases at poultry farms in Washington that could reduce the effectiveness of antiviral drugs, but notes that this is not the same as resistance.

**Bird flu is about to crash flu season. It could get ugly.**
The avian flu, also known as H5N1, is spreading rapidly among dairy cattle in the US, particularly in California, and has infected 46 people in 2024. However, many experts believe the actual number of cases could be much higher due to a lack of widespread testing among farm workers. A recent study found that 7% of farm workers tested had antibodies against the virus, indicating undetected infections. As the US heads into the winter flu season, the risk of reassortment, where the H5N1 virus swaps genetic bits with the seasonal flu virus, is increasing. Virologist Angela Rasmussen warns that this could create a more dangerous virus. To mitigate this risk, experts recommend that farm workers be tested for influenza A and offered antiviral treatment if exposed to an infected cow. Additionally, getting vaccinated against seasonal flu can lower the chances of a genetic shuffling. The CDC has provided free flu shots to states with infected herds and partnered with organizations to provide education and vaccine clinics.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US have reported two new human cases and one porcine case of the H5N1 avian flu epidemic. The porcine case was detected in a small farm in Oregon and is the first case of its kind in the US. The farm has been quarantined and the animals have been slaughtered. According to experts, the fact that the case was detected in a small farm with non-commercial purposes reduces the risk of contagion and does not affect the food market. However, experts warn that the introduction of pigs into the equation could change the dynamics of the epidemic, as pigs have a respiratory system similar to humans and can be infected by both avian and human viruses. This could lead to the creation of new variants, potentially more contagious to humans. The epidemic has affected over 100 million birds, 440 farms, and at least 10,400 wild birds, and has had a significant impact on the meat and dairy industries. The H5N1 avian flu has caused at least 904 human infections and 464 deaths worldwide since 2022.

**From Poultry to Public Health: Understanding the H5N1 Threat**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is monitoring the spread of H5N1 avian influenza in the United States, with 18 human cases reported since 2022. The virus has primarily circulated in the Midwest, with cases raising concerns about potential human transmission and broader public health implications. Despite the rise in cases, the CDC maintains that the risk to the public remains low, although those with occupational exposure to sick animals face a higher risk. The CDC is using the One Health approach to monitor the situation, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. The agency has deployed a multilingual epidemiological field team to assist local health departments with outreach and surveillance efforts. To date, more than 5100 individuals exposed to potentially infected animals have been monitored, and more than 54,000 specimens have been tested for H5N1 viruses. The CDC has also allocated more than 100,000 doses of seasonal flu vaccine for farm workers in 12 states with positive H5 cases to mitigate the risk of spread. Additionally, the CDC is testing existing candidate vaccines for effectiveness against current H5N1 strains. Recent studies suggest that licensed adjuvanted H5N1 vaccines may generate cross-neutralizing antibodies against circulating variants, aiding in pandemic preparedness. The CDC advises that it is currently unlikely humans can become infected through an infected stray, wild, feral, or domestic cat, but human infection can be possible if there is prolonged unprotected exposure to infected animals in individuals not wearing personal protective equipment. The agency also recommends feline owners who have interacted with animals or birds with unknown health status change their clothes and shoes before interacting with personal pets. For owners of potentially infected pets, veterinarians should refer them to their state's Department of Public Health and Environment in order to monitor human exposure and potential human disease transmission.

**H5N1 Bird Flu Outbreak Spreads to California, USA**
The H5N1 bird flu outbreak has spread to California, USA, with over 260 people tested and more than 5,100 monitored for potential exposure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 13 cases in California, with the majority of those affected having contact with infected dairy cows or poultry. The virus has been transmitted from animals to humans, but there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. The CDC has implemented measures such as testing and quarantining dairy farms, but experts say the response is not sufficient. The US government has been criticized for its slow response, with some attributing it to economic interests and the upcoming presidential election. The CDC has distributed over 100,000 doses of flu vaccine to affected states, but experts warn of the risk of co-infection with seasonal and avian flu. A mysterious case in Missouri remains unsolved, with the patient having contact with multiple healthcare workers before stricter safety measures were taken. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) agree that the risk to the general public remains low.

**H5N1 Bird Flu: What You Need to Know**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 27 human cases of avian influenza A(H5) in the US from March to October 2024. The cases include 17 dairy cattle workers, 9 poultry workers, and 1 person without occupational exposure. All patients received oseltamivir treatment and recovered. The CDC has confirmed that dairy cow-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has occurred in the US for the first time. The virus has been detected in dairy cows in Texas, Michigan, Colorado, and California. The CDC has also reported cases of avian influenza A(H5) in poultry workers in Colorado, with 9 cases identified. The virus was associated with exposure to A(H5N1) virus during outbreaks among chickens at two commercial egg-laying facilities in Colorado. The CDC has confirmed a case in Missouri who was hospitalized with atypical symptoms. The source of the virus is unknown, and no secondary transmission to close contacts was identified. The CDC has recommended that any detection of influenza A virus in a respiratory specimen from a human patient across any healthcare setting in the US be subtyped. This includes testing for A(H5) virus. The CDC has also recommended that people who work with infected animals, such as poultry and dairy cows, utilize recommended PPE, including an N95 respirator, eye protection, a protective gown, and gloves. 'We're not seeing severe disease and there were no hospitalizations required,' said Cara Drehoff, Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer at the CDC. 'We didn't see any evidence of human-to-human transmission, and all of the workers who tested positive had been handling sick or dead birds.' The CDC has also emphasized the importance of ongoing surveillance of A(H5N1) viruses in wild birds, poultry, farmed and wild mammals, dairy cows, and any other infected animals to monitor the public health threat. 'Because A(H5N1) viruses, like all influenza A viruses, are dynamic and continually evolving, ongoing surveillance of these viruses is critical to monitoring the public health threat,' said Tim Uyeki, Chief Medical Officer for the Influenza Division at the CDC. 'We will continue to work closely with our local and state health partners on enhanced surveillance for influenza A viruses and novel influenza A viruses.'
