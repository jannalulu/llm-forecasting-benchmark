**First-time home buyers struggle as cash dominates R.I. market**
First-time home buyers in Rhode Island are struggling to compete with cash buyers and those tapping into their equity, as the median sales price for a single-family home hit $485,000 in October, a 11.5 percent year-over-year jump. According to Chris Whitten, 2025 president of the Rhode Island Association of Realtors, 'It's tough for younger buyers to compete with that. Down-payment assistance programs help slightly, but lack of inventory, higher prices, and interest rates are still the biggest pain points preventing our younger generations from starting to build equity through homeownership.' However, the condo market offers hope, with a 15.1 percent hike in sales and a 37.3 percent increase in inventory, making it more attractive to first-time buyers. Whitten added, 'The net worth of a homeowner is $415,000 compared to $10,000 for a renter,' emphasizing the importance of increasing the supply of homes to help younger generations achieve homeownership.

**Will 2025 Be a Buyer’s Housing Market? Zillow’s Bold Predictions**
Zillow predicts a more balanced housing market in 2025, with a potential shift in favor of buyers, especially in the Southwest. The forecast includes a modest increase in home sales, a slower pace of home value growth, and a continued volatility in mortgage rates. Buyers can expect more selection and negotiating power, while sellers may face uncertainty and increased competition. Additionally, Zillow anticipates a shift towards smaller, more sustainable, and affordable homes, as well as a decrease in renter-friendly concessions. Pet-friendly properties are becoming a must-have, with nearly 58% of renters now having pets.

**Here's what the housing market will look like in 2025**
Zillow predicts a more active housing market in 2025 with more inventory and modest home value growth. According to Skylar Olsen, Zillow's chief economist, 'Buying a home in 2024 was surprisingly competitive given how high the affordability hurdle became. More inventory should shake loose in 2025, giving buyers a bit more room to breathe.' Zillow forecasts a 2.6% home value growth in 2025, with 4.3 million existing home sales. However, mortgage rates are expected to be volatile, with potential swings throughout the year. Additionally, Americans are shifting towards smaller homes and renting as a long-term lifestyle, with the term 'cozy' appearing in 35% more listing descriptions in 2024 compared to 2023.

**UK House Prices Rise for First Time in 7 Months, Exacerbating Housing Crisis**
According to the UK's Office for National Statistics, the rate of house price inflation in the UK has risen for the first time in 7 months, reaching over 10% in the capital city, exacerbating the housing crisis for renters. The data shows that house prices increased by 7.8% annually in the UK last month, ending a 7-month decline in the rate of increase. Additionally, house prices rose by 9.0% monthly, the highest monthly increase since February last year. In London, house prices increased by 4.10% annually, the highest increase in the UK, and by 2.1% monthly. This increase in house prices is a new setback for renters, who are already struggling with a housing crisis, despite the UK's consumer price inflation rate approaching the 2% target set by the Bank of England. The UK's housing market is still experiencing a shortage of available properties, with a 24% decrease in available rentals in September compared to pre-pandemic levels, according to Zillow UK. The new Labour government in the UK has promised to do a lot to alleviate the suffering of renters, who are mostly forced to rent due to their inability to afford the cost of owning a home. However, critics say that the government's proposals, which include a ban on evicting tenants without a court order and stricter environmental regulations, have exacerbated the problem by causing property owners to sell their units rather than rent them out. The average monthly rent in London has increased by 26% compared to early 2022, reaching £2172 ( $7,275) per month, according to data from the Office for National Statistics.

**Rental prices in Spain to close 2024 with an 8% increase**
The rental market in Spain is expected to close 2024 with an 8% increase in prices compared to last year, according to Pisos.com. This is a three-point percentage increase from the 6% increase seen in 2023. The increase has been widespread, with some cities reaching double-digit price increases. Barcelona is the most expensive city in the country, with rental prices increasing by 18% this year. Ferran Font, director of studies at the agency, attributes the increase to the law of housing, which has caused many owners to take their properties off the market, resulting in a 60% reduction in the offer of rental properties in the last two years. The lack of new construction and the transfer of properties to the vacation rental market have also contributed to the price increase. Experts agree that there is a imbalance between supply and demand, which favors the increase in rental prices. Pisos.com projects a 10.3% increase in rental prices in the medium term, the highest rate in almost a decade. The competition in the rental market is driving the purchase of homes, which is emerging as an alternative for those with the ability to save. The number of transactions has increased by 41.5% in September compared to the same month in 2023, reaching a total of 61,887 operations.

**Today’s Mortgage Rates Increase: November 19, 2024 Analysis**
Mortgage rates have increased recently, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate reaching 6.60% as of November 19, 2024. This rise is attributed to the strengthening economy, particularly in the labor market, which has placed upward pressure on interest rates. Despite expectations that rates might ease in 2025, many experts are cautious, citing the robust job market and high consumer spending. Homebuyers and those looking to refinance should consider their unique financial situations and weigh the costs and benefits of refinancing, as current rates are higher than previous months. According to Zillow, average rates for various mortgage types include: 30-year fixed: 6.63%, 15-year fixed: 6.06%, 30-year FHA: 5.73%, 30-year VA: 6.03%, and 7/1 ARM: 7.20%.

**The Real CPI May Already Be at 2% | Investing.com UK**
The official inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is reported to be around 2%, but this may be inaccurate due to the lagging nature of CPI data. The shelter component of CPI, which accounts for 40% of CPI, has been running at around 5% annually. However, rental prices, as reported by Zillow and Redfin, have not increased for the last year and a half, with the nationwide median asking rent down $53 from its all-time high in 2022. The author suggests that rent prices may start falling as existing home sale listings rise, and if mortgage rates head lower, the number of existing homes for sale will increase, further pressuring rent prices. When the CPI data catches up with reality, the author expects that CPI will run at 2% or even lower.

**One-third of Philadelphia-area rentals offered free rent or other perks in October**
The rental market in the Philadelphia area has slowed down more than expected, with an influx of new apartments controlling rent increases and forcing landlords to offer concessions to attract residents. According to Zillow, a third of rental listings in October offered free rent or other perks, up 8% from last year. Nationwide, the share of rentals offering concessions has more than doubled over the last five years, from 16% in 2019 to a record 38% in 2024. Kara Ng, a senior economist at Zillow, said that this means renters have 'much more bargaining power' and that landlords are 'very motivated to fill' vacant apartments, especially heading into the holiday season. However, asking rents are still higher than last year in 48 of the 50 largest metro areas, with the typical asking rent in the Philadelphia region being $1,868, up 4% from last year.

**Rent growth slows as inventory grows and concessions reach record levels**
The average asking rent in October was $2,009, a 0.2% decrease from September, according to a Zillow rental market report. This is a steeper drop than usual for this time of year, indicating a softening rental market. Despite this, rents are still up 3.3% year over year and 33.5% since the beginning of the pandemic. The influx of new apartments has slowed multifamily rent growth to 2.3% for the past year, and rental vacancies have risen to 6.9%. Rental concessions have reached record highs, with 37.7% of Zillow listings offering some form of concession in October. Rents fell in 34 major metropolitan areas, with the largest decreases seen in San Antonio and Denver. However, rents are still up from 2023 levels in 48 of the 50 largest metro areas.

**Rental Rate Hikes Slow in October, While Annual Growth Continues**
According to the Observed Renter Demand Index from Zillow, renter interest hit a record low in October, with vacancy rates rising to 6.9% and rental concessions reaching a new peak at 37.7%.

As new apartment buildings come onto the market, renters looking to move soon can expect continued high levels of concessions and slow year-over-year rent growth.

**Rentals Increase by 570% Over the Past 4 Years in Turkey**
Rentals have increased by 570% over the past 4 years, despite the introduction of a 25% rent increase cap in 2022. The demand for rentals has increased due to university students' housing needs, marriages, divorces, business purposes, and urban renewal. The imbalance in supply and demand, as well as opportunity price increases, have driven rent increases over the past 4 years. While inflation has increased by 433% over the same period, rent increases have reached 570%. According to real estate experts, approximately 8 million tenants are in the market, with 250,000 new tenants joining each year. However, the difficulty of accessing housing has made it challenging for many to become homeowners. TSKB Gayrimenkul Değerleme General Manager Makbule Yönel Maya said, 'I think the high rent increase rate will start to slow down, but we can expect a real decline in sales prices for a while.' Maya added, 'The pandemic has caused a significant increase in prices, and the amortization period has decreased from 20-25 years to 15-16 years. I think this is a precursor to the slowdown in rent increases we saw in the past two years. I expect the rent increases to calm down, and sales prices will also stabilize.' Gayrimenkul Değerleme Uzmanı Ahmet Büyükduman said, 'Over the past 4 years, inflation has increased by 433%, while rents have increased by 570%. This means that rents have increased by 26% in real terms. The demand for rentals is increasing due to university students' housing needs, marriages, and other factors. The market is growing at a rate of 3% per year, with 250,000 new tenants joining each year. The prices of homes are not accessible, and the monthly payments are high. If the demand continues to increase, prices will rise rapidly. Therefore, I strongly believe that rent increases will be upward, and I expect them to be slightly above inflation.'

**Annual Home Price Slowdown Continues, Says Report**
According to CoreLogic, U.S. home price growth slowed to 3.4% year-over-year in September 2024, following months of modest monthly declines. Home prices rebounded slightly (0.02%) compared to the previous month. CoreLogic Chief Economist Selma Hepp said, 'Like much of the housing market at the moment, home prices remained relatively flat coming into the fall.' The uncertainty surrounding the U.S. election and mortgage rate volatility may be dampening demand and price appreciation. CoreLogic's forecast shows annual U.S. home price gains relaxing to 2.3% in September 2025. Miami posted the highest year-over-year home price increase at 6.8%, while Rhode Island ranked first for annual appreciation at 9%.

**New HousingWorks RI fact book details challenges faced by homeowners, renters in the state**
A new report from HousingWorks RI reveals that Rhode Island is facing a severe housing crisis, with the median value of single-family homes increasing by 15.1% in 2023, the highest increase in the country. According to Brenda Clement, executive director of HousingWorks RI, the high share of 'cost-burdened' individuals, who pay more than 30% of their income toward housing costs, has been a persistent problem for over 20 years. The report states that 55% of the lowest income renter households and an additional 17,043 households earning up to $59,172 are severely cost burdened. Clement noted that even high-income levels are affected, with households having to make sacrifices such as not buying a second car or going on a trip. The report also found that no municipality in the state can affordably purchase a single-family home for households with an income under $100,000, and that renters require an income of over $84,000 to afford a two-bedroom apartment. Melina Lodge, executive director of The Housing Network of Rhode Island, emphasized that the housing shortage in the state is a major contributor to the crisis, citing the state's size and zoning regulations as factors. The report also highlights the need for increased attention on building multi-family homes, improving existing housing stock, and creating more affordable housing to fix Rhode Island's housing crisis.

**2024 November Rent Increase Rate to be Determined by October Inflation Data**
The expected rent increase for November 2024 will be determined by the TEFE and TÜFE indices. In the past two years, rent increases have been limited to 25%. Now that this policy has ended, everyone is wondering what the new rates will be. The inflation data for October will be announced on November 4, 2024 at 10:00, and this will determine the rent increase for November. Both tenants and landlords will use these data to set new rent prices. The rent increase will be influenced by the monthly and yearly inflation rates. According to the latest data from TÜIK, the consumer price index (TÜFE) has increased by 49.38% annually and 2.97% monthly. This data will directly affect the new rent prices that tenants will have to pay. The expectation is that the rent increase for November will be similar to the 12-month TÜFE rate of 63.47% announced last month. Both tenants and landlords should be careful and follow the inflation data during this process.

**Realtor.com Trends Reveal Millennials Are Making Gains In Surprising States As First-Time Homebuyers Surge**
First-time homebuyers are gaining ground in unexpected states, with Rhode Island leading the way with a 14.3% increase in first-time buyer market share from 2019 to 2024. According to Freddie Mac, the trend extends throughout the Northeastern and Midwestern regions, with Iowa, Nebraska, Wisconsin, and Connecticut seeing first-time buyer shares climb by more than 10% over the same period. However, the broader picture remains challenging for new buyers, with entry-level home prices growing 63% more than high-end home prices since 2000 and a severe supply crunch, with approximately 30 renter households competing for each available home for sale. 'Less affordable housing is acutely felt by those seeking to buy their first homes, especially those without substantial wealth at their disposal,' Freddie Mac's report says. The shift is driven by a demographic wave, with Millennials and the oldest members of Generation Z becoming a force in the housing market, with three million renter households between ages 25 and 44 now earning at least $75,000 annually in inflation-adjusted terms.

During the earnings call on October 30, 2024, Getty Realty also announced a 4.4% increase in quarterly dividends to $0.47 per share, continuing its 11-year streak of dividend growth. The company's efforts to attract capital were successful, raising $245 million through common stock and unsecured debt, which strengthened liquidity for future investments. Getty Realty's strategic actions, such as the Chipotle reconstruction project in Providence, Rhode Island, and the signing of leases for three new car wash projects, demonstrate a proactive approach to growth. The company's focus on direct deals with tenants and the completion of significant lease extensions have contributed to a strengthened portfolio. With a stable overall coverage ratio and improved performance in new assets, such as car washes, Getty Realty successfully navigates the current economic landscape, laying the foundation for future success. The company's expectation of announcing fourth-quarter and full-year results in February 2024 indicates a promising position as it continues to execute its growth strategy. InvestingPro's data also supports Getty Realty's strong third-quarter 2024 results. The company's market capitalization of $1.88 billion reflects its significant presence in the real estate sector. With a P/E ratio of 27.03, Getty Realty trades with a premium compared to some competitors, which may be justified by its stable growth and dividend performance. InvestingPro's recommendations highlight Getty Realty's impressive dividend history. The company has paid dividends for 30 consecutive years and increased them for 8 consecutive years. This aligns with the company's recent announcement of a 4.4% increase in quarterly dividends, demonstrating a commitment to shareholder returns that goes beyond its 11-year streak. The company's financial health also deserves attention. InvestingPro notes that Getty Realty's liquid assets exceed its short-term liabilities, confirming its strong liquidity position of over $495 million mentioned in the article. This financial stability is crucial for implementing the growth strategy in retail and automotive retail sectors. Getty Realty's revenue growth of 14.02% over the last 12 months, reported by InvestingPro, confirms the 13.1% increase in annual base rent compared to the previous year mentioned in the earnings report. Additionally, the company can boast a high gross margin of 88.85%, highlighting its operational efficiency.

**Attention Tenants: Rent Increases by 227% in November**
Despite the 2020 rent law being repealed, some tenants are still bound by the previous regulations and will see a 227.13% increase in their rent in November. This means that those who currently pay $150,000 per month will have to pay approximately $490,000. The increase is lower than the 238% rise in October, due to a decrease in the inflation index. Tenant associations are on high alert due to the difficulties tenants face in paying rent, with many families having to cut back on essential expenses to afford housing. According to real estate companies, the compliance rate is around 97%, but the reality is that families are making sacrifices to ensure they have a roof over their heads.

**US Rents Continue to Rise, but at a Slower Pace**
According to Redfin, the average rent in the US increased by 0.6% in September, reaching $1634. This is in line with the trend of the past two years, where prices have remained within a range of $1599 to $1663. However, in 16 of the last 24 months, rents have been even more stable, between $1630 and $1650. Redfin's economist, Sheharyar Bokhari, noted that while rents have remained stable at a national level, the trend could be 'very different' depending on where you live. He explained that in areas with less construction, such as the East Coast and Midwest, rents are rising, while in cities with a high supply of new housing, such as those in the Sun Belt, rents are falling. The cities with the largest increases in rent were in the Midwest and East Coast, with Washington, D.C. experiencing a 12% increase. In contrast, Jacksonville, Florida, saw a 11.3% decrease in rent. Zillow reported that the increase in rent prices has slowed down due to a decrease in demand and an increase in inventory. Property managers are offering more concessions to attract tenants. Zillow estimated that prices will fall as new rentals enter the market. The Biden administration has proposed a law that would limit rent increases to 5% annually for landlords with more than 50 units. This would affect over 20 million rentals in the US. However, the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders have criticized the plan, saying it would infringe on property rights and discourage new construction.
