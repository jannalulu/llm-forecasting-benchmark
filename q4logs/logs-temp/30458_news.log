**Trump Supports Jimmy Patronis to Fill Gaetz's Congressional Seat**
US President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support for Florida State Treasurer Jimmy Patronis to fill the congressional seat left vacant by Matt Gaetz. Trump wrote on his media platform 'Truth Social', 'Jimmy Patronis is the current Florida State Treasurer, who has also served as the state fire chief and a key member of the Florida Cabinet. I've heard that Jimmy is considering running for Congress in Florida's 1st Congressional District.' 'He has always been a good friend of mine and 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA). As your next Congressman, Jimmy will work with me to develop our economy, protect our border security, stop immigration crimes, strengthen our incredible military/ veterans, restore America's energy dominance, and defend our Second Amendment, which has been under attack.' Trump concluded, 'If he decides to run, I fully support him. Run, Jimmy, run!' Trump announced his nomination of Gaetz as Attorney General on November 13, and Gaetz resigned from his congressional seat the same day. On November 22, Gaetz withdrew from the Attorney General election and stated he would not return to Congress. Patronis seems to be ready to accept the suggestion. On Monday afternoon, he posted on social media, 'Let me get to work, Mr. President!... I'm here to serve.' Monday was a crucial day. Any elected official interested in running for the special election to fill Gaetz's seat must submit their resignation by Monday. Currently, two Florida state representatives and one local elected official have expressed plans to run. Before the 2026 election, Gaetz's congressional seat will be filled by a person chosen by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. State Senator Joe Gruters, a longtime ally of Trump, has announced his intention to run for state treasurer, but has had conflicts with DeSantis. The question is whether DeSantis will appoint someone who has opposed him to fill the position. Additionally, Lara Trump, the daughter-in-law of Trump, has expressed interest in being appointed to the Senate seat left vacant by Marco Rubio. Trump nominated Rubio for Secretary of State, and Rubio's Senate seat will be filled by DeSantis until the next election in two years. Patronis, a well-known restaurateur in Panama City, Florida, was appointed state treasurer by then-Governor Rick Scott in 2017 and has been a strong ally of Scott. He supported Scott in his first gubernatorial campaign, defeating the majority of the Republican establishment's candidate. Patronis does not reside in Gaetz's congressional district, but he is well-known in the area. Before Trump expressed his support for Patronis, he posted on social media over the weekend, publicly endorsing state Senator Randy Fine to run for the congressional seat left vacant by Mike Waltz. Trump chose Waltz as his next National Security Adviser. Trump's public statement may increase pressure on Governor DeSantis to choose a candidate to fill the congressional and other positions.

**Who Should DeSantis Appoint to Replace Rubio? Here’s a Bold Idea**
Ron DeSantis has not yet announced who he will appoint to replace Marco Rubio in the U.S. Senate, but one potential candidate has been suggested: himself. DeSantis has proven himself as a successful leader, securing commanding victories in statewide elections and turning Florida into a solid red state. Serving in the Senate would provide him with a prominent platform to champion conservative policies, gain further national experience, and remain a key player in shaping the GOP's future. While this move might be somewhat controversial, it could be a strategic part of DeSantis' long-term plan, allowing him to prepare for a potential presidential run in 2028. DeSantis said, 'Florida deserves a Senator who will help President Trump deliver on his election mandate, be strong on immigration and border security, take on the entrenched bureaucracy and administrative state, reverse the nation’s fiscal decline, be animated by conservative principles, and has a proven record of results.'

**Ron DeSantis Allegedly Won’t Appoint Matt Gaetz for Open Senate Seat**
According to a source, Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., will not appoint former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., to the open Senate seat. The source, who remains anonymous, told The National Review, 'He won't appoint Matt.' However, DeSantis has not officially confirmed this information, leaving it unclear whether the source is accurate. This news comes after conservatives suggested that DeSantis should appoint Gaetz to fill the vacant position. Some, like Sean Davis, CEO of The Federalist, and Doctor Robert W. Malone, supported Gaetz's potential appointment, while others, such as conservative commentator Ian Haworth, believed there was a 0% chance of DeSantis appointing Gaetz.

**Ron DeSantis Announces Timeline for Marco Rubio's Senate Replacement**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he will likely make a decision in early January 2025 on who will fill the Senate seat left by Marco Rubio. DeSantis stated that his office has already begun studying potential candidates and will continue to work on it in the coming weeks. Rubio is set to resign from the Senate to become Secretary of State under the incoming Trump administration. DeSantis explained that 'in the coming weeks, more thorough evaluations and interviews with candidates will be conducted, and it is likely that the selection will be made in early January.' He added that Florida deserves a senator who will help President Trump fulfill his electoral mandate, be firm on immigration and border security, and have a proven track record of results. Possible candidates include Lara Trump, the president-elect's daughter-in-law, Vice Governor Jeanette Nuñez, Attorney General Ashley Moody, and former House Speaker Paul Renner. Rubio's confirmation as Secretary of State would make him the first Latino to lead American diplomacy, responding to the growth of Trump's votes in that sector in the last presidential elections.

DeSantis has the authority to appoint a temporary replacement for Rubio, with the seat up for election again in 2026.

**DeSantis to Decide on Rubio Replacement by Early January**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said on Monday that he will likely make a decision on who will replace Senator Marco Rubio in the Senate by early January. DeSantis stated, 'We've already received strong interest from several potential candidates, and we're continuing to gather additional candidate names and conducting a preliminary evaluation.' He added, 'We'll be conducting more extensive evaluations and interviews with candidates in the coming weeks, with a selection likely made by early January.' Several lawmakers, including Senators Rick Scott, Lindsey Graham, and Katie Britt, as well as Representative Anna Paulina Luna, have publicly endorsed Lara Trump, the niece of President-elect Trump, as a key candidate. Others mentioned as potential replacements for Rubio include DeSantis' chief of staff, James Uthmeier, Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nuñez, and State Attorney General Ashley Moody. Supporters of Lara Trump argue that having her in the Senate would ensure that the President-elect has two allies in the Senate representing Florida, which has become the center of the Republican Party universe. However, choosing someone like Uthmeier would ensure that DeSantis has one of his closest allies in the chamber.

**DeSantis gets chance to shape political future with Rubio replacement - Washington Examiner**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has the opportunity to appoint a replacement for Senator Marco Rubio, who has been nominated as the next secretary of state. DeSantis's choice will hold the seat until 2026, when a special election will be held to fill the remaining two years of Rubio's term. Insiders believe DeSantis will not appoint himself or his wife, but instead, may choose a caretaker who would step aside so he could run for Senate later. Potential candidates include James Uthmeier, DeSantis's chief of staff, and Lara Trump, the president-elect's daughter-in-law, who has expressed interest in the seat. DeSantis's decision will be influenced by his own political future, particularly his potential 2028 presidential run.
