**Gukesh is favourite in World Chess Championship, he needs to fight in every single game: Levon Aronian**
Indian chess grandmaster Dommaraju Gukesh is the favourite to win the World Chess Championship against Ding Liren, according to American grandmaster Levon Aronian.

**Who Will Win The World Championship? Vidit And Giri Predict Gukesh Dominance Over Ding**
GMs Anish Giri and Vidit Gujrathi believe that GM Gukesh Dommaraju is a big favorite to defeat the reigning World Champion GM Ding Liren in the 2024 FIDE World Championship. Giri said, 'I don't think it'll be close. But of course, Ding still makes his moves. Gukesh will be nervous, but I think Gukesh will win, like plus three or something, with a couple of games to go.' Vidit agreed, speculating, 'I think the first three games will be drawn. Gukesh can also lose one of the games because he is a bit ambitious. That can happen. But in general, I feel once he scores his first win, he'll just get the momentum and then keep scoring. So, plus two, plus three.' Ding has been struggling, with a winless streak of 28 classical games, and is now ranked 23rd in the world.

**Chess, Olympiad 2024: 88 games, 50 wins, 6 gold medals – India usher in golden era in Budapest**
The Indian open and women's teams at the 2024 Chess Olympiad in Budapest won a total of 88 games, 50 wins, and 6 gold medals. Seven out of the ten Indian players remained unbeaten, with four of them - Gukesh Dommaraju, Arjun Erigaisi, Divya Deshmukh, and Vantika Agrawal - winning individual gold medals. According to Pravin Thipsay, the first Indian to earn a Grandmaster norm, 'the rise of the youngsters is very important.' He added, 'Gukesh and Abdusattarov are the pioneers in this case for this generation. They have shown you don't have to wait until you are 30-35 to beat the best in the world.' India's success in Budapest is attributed to the 2022 Chess Olympiad, where the All India Chess Federation hosted the tournament, giving the youngsters an opportunity to compete with multiple Indian teams. Thipsay believes that this laid the foundation for the twin gold medals two years later. 'This is just the beginning of the golden time,' he said.

**Chess Olympiad 2024: Germany's Teams Struggle, but Other Stories Emerge**
The 45th FIDE Chess Olympiad is taking place in Budapest from September 10 to 23. The event is the most significant team competition in chess, with 197 teams competing in the open and 183 teams in the women's tournament. Women have the option to play in the open tournament, and Grandmaster Elvira Berend is taking advantage of this, playing for Luxembourg alongside her husband, FIDE Master Fred Berend. The teams compete on four boards, with team points being the deciding factor, and individual points serving as a secondary measure. The German men's team is currently in 20th place with 6.2 points after four rounds, while the women's team is in 24th place with the same score. The 19-year-old Vincent Keymer contributed to the men's team's loss to Lithuania, while the 39-year-old Elisabeth Pähtz has given up the top board to Dinara Wagner, sparking speculation about her career. Magnus Carlsen, the world's top-ranked player, started in the third round and won his games, but had to ride a borrowed bike to the tournament hall due to a malfunctioning shuttle service. The USA's 1.5-2.5 loss to Ukraine was a surprise, with Fabiano Caruana's win not being enough to compensate for the losses of other players. The 83-year-old Pauline Woodward is the oldest player at the tournament, representing Guernsey, which is participating for the first time. The Seychelles, discovered by Vasco da Gama, have a small but growing chess community, thanks to the efforts of André Stratonowitsch, a 38-year-old optometrist who moved to the island and became the country's top player.

The 45th Chess Olympiad is set to begin in Budapest on September 11, 2024. The Indian women's team, led by D Harika and R Vaishali, is a strong contender for the podium, despite the non-participation of Koneru Humpy.

In the open section, the United States is the top favourite, but the Indian team, led by D Gukesh, is seeded second and has a good mix of youth and experience. The Chinese team, including reigning World Champion Ding Liren, is seeded third.
