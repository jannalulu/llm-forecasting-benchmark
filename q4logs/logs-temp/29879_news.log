**Framing the Future: Who Will Be Iceland's Next Prime Minister?**
Icelanders, we need to think about our next step! Who will be the next prime minister after the elections? Which individual and party is likely to lead a three-party coalition, rather than a four-party coalition? Let's examine the leading candidates of each party and ask ourselves who is most likely to succeed. I'm not sure, but Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson is likely to be at the forefront. He showed this in 2016 when Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson resigned, and everything fell into place quickly, allowing the people to assess Sigurður Ingi's work. With him, we can expect ministers who have earned a good reputation. Lilja Dögg Alfreðsdóttir, the party's deputy leader, has made significant contributions to culture and the arts. Lilja has been a spokesperson for the Icelandic language and has '...'

**Bjarni Benediktsson Rules Out Participation in EU-Advocating Government**
Bjarni Benediktsson, chairman of the Independence Party, stated in a debate on Stöð 2 that he would not participate in a government that would advocate for Iceland's entry into the European Union. He said, 'I see no reason for entry into the EU.' Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, chairman of the Centre Party, asked Bjarni if he would consider giving something in exchange for the EU's entry, but Bjarni replied that he would not take part in a government that would fight for entry into the EU. This statement suggests that Bjarni is not opposed to taking part in a government that aligns with the Independence Party's stance on the EU.

**Samfylkingin Aims to Close Tax Loophole for High-Income Individuals**
The Icelandic Social Democratic Alliance (Samfylkingin) aims to close the tax loophole for high-income individuals, known as the ehf-gatið. This loophole allows individuals with income above 1.3 million ISK per month to pay lower taxes than employees with the same income. The party's leader emphasizes that this is a matter of social justice and equality, and that closing the loophole will not increase taxes for ordinary working people, such as craftsmen, traders, and pipers. The party also aims to reduce the cost of living and doing business in Iceland, which has been a major issue for small and medium-sized enterprises. Samfylkingin plans to achieve this by reducing interest rates, increasing the supply of housing, introducing a price stability rule, and approving a tax-free budget. The party's goal is to make Iceland work again for ordinary people, including craftsmen, traders, and pipers.

**Questioning Past Deals: Björn Bjarnason Raises Concerns about Potential Breach of Law**
Björn Bjarnason has raised questions on his website about a news article in Morgunblaðið, where Njáll Trausti Friðbertsson, chairman of the parliamentary budget committee, stated that the agreement between Dags B. Eggertsson, a deputy mayor in 2013, and Katrín Júlíusdóttir, the then finance minister, to sell 11 hectares of land at Skerjafirði airport was a breach of law. Now, Katrín is the leader of the Social Democratic Alliance and Dagur is a candidate, both endorsed by the current party chairman, Kristrún Frostadóttir. Björn is surprised that this matter has not been investigated by the parliamentary oversight committee, and adds that 'the new Social Democratic Alliance now has the opportunity to show in practice that those who stand by such agreements about state property do not enjoy impunity.'

**Social Democratic Alliance Leader Jóhann Páll Jóhannsson on Recent Controversy**
Jóhann Páll Jóhannsson, a member of the Icelandic parliament and the leader of the Reykjavík South constituency for the Social Democratic Alliance, believes that the party will not be harmed by the recent controversy surrounding Kristrún Frostadóttir's comments about Dagur B. Eggertsson. Frostadóttir stated that Eggertsson was only in an auxiliary role and would not be the prime minister, and suggested that he could be removed from the party's list of candidates. Jóhann Páll says that Frostadóttir's comments were not unexpected, given her tendency to speak her mind freely. He also praises Dagur B. Eggertsson for his enthusiasm and commitment to the party's program, saying that he is 'a great strength' for the party. Jóhann Páll does not believe that the controversy will harm the party's chances in the upcoming elections, saying that people in Iceland are looking for change and are more focused on the party's policies than individual controversies. He also notes that the party has been gaining ground in recent opinion polls, and is optimistic about the party's chances in the elections.

**Kristrún Frostadóttir's Conditional Offer to Dagur B. Eggertsson**
Kristrún Frostadóttir, the leader of the Social Democratic Alliance, sent a message to voters stating that Dagur B. Eggertsson, the former mayor of Reykjavik, would not be a suitable candidate for the position of prime minister. However, she offered him a seat on the party's list, but with the condition that he would not be a candidate for the position of prime minister. Kristrún emphasized that Dagur would be an 'auxiliary player' and 'in a supporting role'. She also stated that if Dagur was on the list, she would not be satisfied with his presence and would rather strike him out. The article suggests that Kristrún's actions are motivated by a desire to distance herself from Dagur's past as mayor, citing issues with the management of Reykjavik, poor services to residents, and questionable financial decisions. The article concludes that Kristrún's actions are a clear indication of her party's stance on Dagur's candidacy and that she is trying to downplay the negative impact of his presence on the party's chances of winning.

**Social Democratic Alliance's Leader Makes Serious Mistakes in Election Campaign**
The leader of the Social Democratic Alliance, Kristrún Frostadóttir, has made three serious mistakes in the election campaign, according to the article. The party may lose the lead it has had in opinion polls for over a year due to the leader's mistakes. Many believe that Kristrún's lack of experience in politics is now showing, and she seems to be struggling in the upcoming elections. The article also criticizes Kristrún's handling of the party's list in Reykjavík, where she has been promoting Degi B. Eggertsson, a former mayor, over other candidates. The article suggests that Kristrún is afraid of being overshadowed by Eggertsson, who is a strong candidate for the party. Additionally, the article criticizes the party's decision to put Þórði Snæ Júlíusson, who was recently fired from the Ministry of Justice, and Víðir Reynisson in the top spots on the party's list in South Iceland. The article concludes that the Social Democratic Alliance and the Independence Party have made serious mistakes in their list choices, and that the Centre Party may become the largest party in the upcoming elections.

Arna Lára Jónsdóttir, the mayor of Ísafjarðarbær and a member of the Social Democratic Alliance, will lead the party's list in the Northwestern constituency for the upcoming parliamentary elections.

'Now we're all in the boat together,' said Arna Lára Jónsdóttir in a statement on the party's website. 'We'll work together to achieve victory. But to do that, we need to show unity, be positive, put our differences aside, and speak clearly and cleverly on the issues that matter to our equal society.'

**Inga Sæland Responds to Össur Skarphéðinsson's Accusations**
Inga Sæland, the chairman of the People's Party, has responded to Össur Skarphéðinsson, the former chairman of the Social Democratic Alliance, regarding his accusations that she is an authoritarian leader. Inga says that she knows nothing about the internal work of the party and that his accusations have no basis in reality. 'I'm just coming to send a love message to Össur Skarphéðinsson and his friends in the Social Democratic Alliance,' she said in a video posted on her Facebook page today. 'It's really comical to see their true nature come out with their mudslinging, ill-mannered behavior, and things that have no basis in reality.' Össur has since withdrawn his accusations, saying that Inga is an authoritarian leader and that her behavior is unacceptable in the 21st century. He also criticized her for removing Jakob Frímann Magnússon and Tómas A. Tómasson from the party's leadership in the run-up to the parliamentary elections. 'Inga Sæland talks about a lack of democracy – most recently when the government was being formed – but at the same time, she takes authoritarian control of the People's Party, breaks its rules and laws, and excludes members from the party list if they don't dance to her tune,' Össur said. 'Össur Skarphéðinsson is not a party official. He knows nothing about the internal work of the People's Party. He knows nothing about how democratic and beautiful our party is, how great our election machine is, and how we hold everything together in our struggle. So, I'll just keep going, and Össur Skarphéðinsson, you're not far behind,' Inga said in response.

**Sanna Magnúsdóttir to Participate in Live Discussion on Spursmálum**
Sanna Magnúsdóttir, the leader of the Social Democratic Alliance in Iceland, will participate in a live discussion on Spursmálum (a Icelandic news program) today at 2 PM. The discussion will cover current events and the upcoming parliamentary elections on November 30. The Social Democratic Alliance will be running a list of candidates in all electoral districts, but they failed to win any seats in the last election, receiving only 4.1% of the national vote. Sanna hopes to change this outcome. According to a recent poll by Prósents, the party's support has increased to 4.2%, but they still need to reach a minimum of 5% to win a seat in parliament. The discussion will be broadcast on mbl.is at 2 PM and will also be available on major streaming platforms.

**Icelanders Want Kristrún Frostadóttir to Lead Next Government**
According to a recent poll by Maskína, 66% of the population are satisfied with the current government. Meanwhile, 33% of the respondents want Kristrún Frostadóttir, the leader of the Social Democratic Alliance, to lead the next government and become the Prime Minister. In second place is Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, the leader of the Centre Party, with 18%. The other candidates, including Bjarni Benediktsson, Þorgerður Katrín Gunnarsdóttir, and Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson, received around 10-12% of the votes. Margrét Helga spoke with Kristrún Frostadóttir about the recent poll, and Kristrún said, 'The key issue in this election campaign is that we in the Social Democratic Alliance aim to drive forward unity. We do not aim to drive forward divisive issues.' She emphasized that the party will focus on issues that unite the people, such as security in housing, responsible governance, and strengthening the healthcare system. 'We need trust in leadership, we need unity, and we need people to come together. And this will be the focus of the Social Democratic Alliance now.'

**Social Democratic Alliance's New Platform: A Shift in Icelandic Politics?**
The Social Democratic Alliance, led by Kristrún, has announced its election platform, 'Stolt þjóð' (Proud Nation), which is in line with the ideology of the Centre Party. The platform emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and expertise, with Alma and Víðir, the party's candidates, advocating for a more specialized approach to governance. However, this approach has been met with skepticism, as experts are increasingly seen as being more driven by ideology than scientific evidence. The Centre Party has historically been the bastion of liberal politics in Iceland, and its growth in recent years has been fueled by dissatisfaction among conservative voters who have expressed support for Sigmund Davíð in opinion polls. The Social Democratic Alliance's platform is more focused on social issues, such as climate change and LGBTQ+ rights, than on economic issues, which is a departure from the traditional focus of the Centre Party. Kristrún, the party leader, has stated that the Social Democratic Alliance will not take a hardline stance against the current right-wing government, but rather will seek to work with them after the elections. However, this approach may ultimately lead to the Social Democratic Alliance losing support to the Centre Party and the Left-Green Movement.

**Iceland to Hold Early Election After Government Collapse**
Iceland's Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson has dissolved the ruling coalition due to deep divisions over foreign policy, refugee, and energy issues. The early election will be held on November 30, 2024, nine months ahead of the previously scheduled date in September 2025. According to a Gallup poll, the ruling coalition received only 24.6% of the citizens' support, the lowest level in 30 years.

**Iceland Sets Snap Election For November 30**
Iceland will hold a snap election on November 30, following the collapse of the three-party coalition government. Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson announced the government's resignation over deep divisions on issues such as foreign policy, asylum seekers, and energy. President Halla Tomasdottir accepted the resignation and set a date for the election. The Left-Green Movement will not be part of the interim government, leaving a two-party coalition in charge until after the election. A Gallup poll showed that the coalition government had the support of just 24.6 percent of voters, the lowest score in 30 years. The Social Democrats came in ahead of the three parties combined, at 26.1 percent. Benediktsson took over as prime minister in April 2024 after Katrin Jakobsdottir resigned to run for the presidency, which she failed to win. 'The president accepted the resignation and requested that the government would act as a caretaker government until a new government has been formed following parliamentary elections that will take place on November 30,' the government said.

**Össur Skarphéðinsson: Sigurður Ingi will end his term as Prime Minister**
Össur Skarphéðinsson, former chairman of the Social Democratic Alliance, believes that Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson, chairman of the Progressive Party, will end his term as Prime Minister. Össur compares the current situation to the 2016 parliamentary proposal by Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, chairman of the Centre Party, and the current proposal by Bjarni Benediktsson, Prime Minister. Össur quotes Bjarni as saying that it would be best if the current government remained in power until the next elections, but if the coalition parties did not want that, he would submit a resignation to the President. Svandís Svavarsdóttir, chairman of the Left-Green Movement, said that it would be most important for Bjarni to submit a resignation and that she could imagine a caretaker government with Sigurður Ingi as Prime Minister. Össur says that according to his own statement, Bjarni was supposed to meet with the President to submit a resignation for his government. Össur believes that Sigurður Ingi will end his term as Prime Minister. 'So the story repeats itself. When men set up a play, they must think of the end. It did not happen in 2016, and it will not happen in 2024,' Össur says in the end.

**Iceland's Coalition Government Collapses, New Elections Proposed**
The coalition government in Iceland has collapsed, announced Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson, who has proposed new elections for late November. The coalition, composed of the Independence Party, the Left-Green Movement, and the Progressive Party, has been plagued by persistent political disagreements on issues such as foreign policy, asylum seeker management, and energy policy. 'The points of disagreement were less discussed during the last elections than they should be today,' Benediktsson said, highlighting 'how different the Left-Green Movement's vision for the future is from what I want to defend.' 'It is better for the government to have a common vision,' he added. 'It's disappointing when projects fail or circumstances change.' Benediktsson, a seasoned politician, has the firm support of his party and plans to run in the November elections.

**Iceland PM Calls November Snap Vote as Coalition Disbanded**
Iceland's Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson has broken up his coalition government and called a snap election for late November. The move follows growing discontent among coalition parties, particularly over asylum seekers and energy policy. Benediktsson stated, 'Toward the fall, a rising disagreement between coalition parties started emerging.' The opposition Social Democrats are currently leading the polls, indicating a potential shift in power. The election needs to take place no later than 45 days after the parliament has been dissolved. The coalition's first term culminated in the Covid-19 pandemic, but since then, tensions have been building over immigration policy, power generation, and fisheries. Asylum policy has been a particularly contentious issue, with the Independence Party wanting to take a tighter stance and the Left Greens intervening in a deportation case. The environmental movement is also opposed to the Independence Party's plans to build more power generation. The country is facing challenges such as persistent inflation, high interest rates, and volcanic eruptions, which have caused a need to rebuild infrastructure and re-house about 1% of the population.

**Iceland's Government Collapses, New Elections Likely in November**
The coalition government in Iceland has collapsed, and it appears that new elections will be held in November, a year ahead of schedule. According to Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson, the government has come to an end due to disagreements over immigration, energy policy, and other issues. Benediktsson, who is also the leader of the Independence Party, announced the government's resignation at a press conference on Sunday. The government, which consisted of the Independence Party, the Liberal Party, and the Green Movement, is expected to dissolve on Monday, and new elections are likely to be held on November 30. This is a year ahead of the scheduled elections, which were originally set for next autumn. Recent opinion polls have given a boost to the opposition Social Democratic Party.

**Independence Party Sees Surge in Interest Ahead of Elections**
Bergþór Ólason, chairman of the Independence Party, says many people are interested in joining the party's list for the next parliamentary elections. According to a Gallup poll, the party has 18.7% support, second only to the Social Democratic Alliance. If elections were held now, the party would likely win 13 seats in parliament, up from the three seats it currently holds. Bergþór says that many people have expressed interest in joining the party, and he is pleased to see young people showing interest in the party's work. 'Young people are looking for answers to real-life problems, such as housing, inflation, and education,' he says. 'They see politics as a way to make a difference.' Bergþór notes that the party has a short time frame to prepare for elections, but he is confident that they can do it. 'We've done it before, and we can do it again,' he says.

**Centre Party's Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson: 'It is a great day.'**
Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, the leader of the Centre Party, is interviewed in a live broadcast on Vísi and Stöð 2-Vísi at 14:00. His party was on the verge of falling from parliament after the Klausturmálið scandal, but is now gaining momentum in the polls. Sigmundur Davíð was unexpectedly elected as the leader of the Progressive Party in January 2009, and initially defended the minority government of the Social Democratic Alliance and the Left-Green Movement. However, he became one of the strongest opponents of the government of these parties after the elections. His party's support continued to grow, and after the 2013 elections, he became the Prime Minister in a coalition government with the Independence Party. After the Panama Papers scandal, he resigned from office, left the Progressive Party, and founded the Centre Party a year later. The party performed well in the elections, winning 10.9% of the vote and seven seats in parliament. However, the party lost half of its support in the 2018 elections after the Klausturmálið scandal, which had a significant impact on the party's position. Two members of the People's Party later joined the Centre Party, but it was not enough. The party received only 5.4% in the 2021 elections and was on the verge of falling from parliament. However, the party has now gained momentum and is consistently ranked as the second-largest party in the country. According to the latest Gallup poll, the Centre Party has 18.7% support and would win 13 seats in parliament. Sigmundur Davíð said, 'It is a great day.' The Centre Party could potentially form a two-party government with the Social Democratic Alliance, and Gallup also calculated the number of seats the party would win in a coalition government with the Alliance. Sigmundur Davíð will be interviewed in a live broadcast on Vísi and Stöð 2-Vísi at 14:00, which will be broadcast again on Stöð 2 at 19:05.

**Government Support Hits Record Low in Iceland**
A recent Gallup survey in Iceland has revealed a record low in government support, with the Social Democratic Alliance polling at 26% and the Independence Party at 14%, its lowest level ever. Meanwhile, the Centre Party is gaining momentum, currently polling at 18.7%. If these trends continue, the Centre Party and the Social Democratic Alliance could potentially form a government with a slim majority in the upcoming parliamentary elections. The survey also shows that support for the government has continued to dip, with nearly 24% of respondents expressing their backing of the coalition, marking the lowest level measured in three decades of polling.

**Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson Faces Questions in Samtalið**
Bjarni Benediktsson, the Prime Minister of Iceland and leader of the Independence Party, will be interviewed in the new national language program 'Samtalið' on Vísir and Stöð 2/Vísir at 14:00 today. The program will also be broadcast on Stöð 2 at 19:10 tonight. The program is a new national language program that will be on the schedule every Friday in the winter. Many questions are being asked of Bjarni Benediktsson, who has been the leader of the Independence Party for the longest period of time, 15 years. He leads a government that has been controversial since the start of the previous government of the Left-Green Party, Independence Party, and Progressive Party. Growing dissatisfaction has been felt in the government coalition since it was renewed after the 2021 elections, with some saying that the government cannot maintain its position with the dissatisfaction that reigns within it. Support for the government has decreased significantly, and according to polls, it is on the verge of collapse. The support for the Independence Party has also decreased, with the party's support now at 14%. Many controversial issues are waiting to be addressed in the Althing this last parliamentary session before the elections, with 217 government bills on the agenda. It appears that within the government, there will be a discussion about energy and power issues, foreigner issues, and issues related to the constitution in the country. According to the electoral law, the next parliamentary elections should take place in September next year. Elections were held in the autumn of 2016 after Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson resigned as Prime Minister before the end of the term and the elections, and in the autumn of 2017 after the government of Bjarni Benediktsson collapsed after only ten months. The current coalition parties, which formed a government after the 2017 elections, decided to serve out the term, so that for the third time in a row, elections were held in the autumn of 2021. Now, many are wondering whether the coalition parties will call for elections next spring, as it has been a tradition for parliamentary elections to take place in the spring. This question and many others will be discussed in the live broadcast of Samtalið on Vísir and Stöð 2/Vísir at 14:00 today.
