**Alta currently allowing uphill travel, check ski resort websites for changes**
Alta Ski Area is currently allowing uphill travel during the day, but not between 5 p.m. and 6 a.m. Skiers must remain off the mountain during those times. According to Aspen Snowmass, some skiers choose to travel uphill to increase their workout and take in the views, while others prepare for backcountry skiing. The Utah Avalanche Center notes that every resort determines its own uphill travel policies, and recommends visiting individual ski resort websites for specific information. Alta's uphill travel website warns potential users about the risks associated with uphill travel, including unmarked hazards and the presence of ski resort equipment. The website also emphasizes that skiers are responsible for their own rescue and must carry avalanche rescue equipment and have proper training. In contrast, Deer Valley Ski Resort prohibits all uphill travel within resort boundaries.

**Ski hill 2024 opening days in Alberta, British Columbia**
Ski resorts in Alberta and British Columbia are preparing for the 2024-25 winter season. In Banff, Sunshine Village and Lake Louise Ski Resort will open on November 8, while Norquay will open on November 9. In Kananaskis Country, Nakiska will have a preview weekend from November 8-12. Marmot Basin in Jasper is tentatively set to open on November 15, despite losing seven weeks of summer maintenance time due to a massive wildfire. According to Brian Rode, vice president of Marmot Basin, 'There are a lot of very tired people at our mountain, who are just putting their hearts and souls into getting it ready for the ski season.' The resort has installed a new main powerline and has all the staff needed to run the ski hill this winter, but is still short of accommodation for residents and seasonal staff. Alysa Pederson, weather preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada, said, 'Whether it’s normal or above normal, it’s a little bit harder to tell at this point, but it looks to be likely more than we had last year,' regarding the expected snowfall this winter due to a La Niña weather system.

**California ski season: What’s new at Tahoe, Mammoth for winter 2024-25**
California mountain resorts are gearing up for the 2024-25 ski season with improved snowmaking and grooming, as well as new pass options, lesson programs, and special events. According to Mike Reitzell, head of the nonprofit Ski California group, last year's warm weather was a challenge, but good storms in February and March saved the season. This year, resorts hope to open between late November and early December. Palisades (formerly Squaw Valley) is celebrating its 75th anniversary, while Boreal and Mt. Rose mark their 60th seasons. New developments include the ASC XC Training Center, offering Alpine, Nordic, biathlon, and snowboarding programs, and Bear Valley Mountain Resort, which has new ownership, two new lifts, revamped food service, and improved grooming. The CaliPass provides access to Bear Valley, as well as other resorts. Additionally, Bear Valley Adventure Company offers 38 miles of groomed cross-country trails, lessons, and tubing and sledding.

The earliest opening date is mid-November, with resorts such as Heavenly and Sugar Bowl opening on November 22.

**Ski season has officially started: First US ski resort is now open**
The 2024-2025 ski season has officially started with the opening of Ski Ward in Massachusetts on October 19, but it's not the first resort to offer a full mountain experience. Wolf Creek Ski Area in Colorado is the first larger resort to open with chairlift service seven days a week, on October 22, after receiving 26 inches of total snow. The early season is not beginner-friendly due to limited terrain, but many other resorts in the west are expected to open soon, with Keystone and Arapahoe Basin aiming to open sooner rather than later. Breckenridge, Brian Head, and Copper Mountain have announced an opening date of November 8, while Vail, Mammoth, Winter Park, and others plan to open by mid-November. On the East Coast, ski resorts are expected to open in mid-November or December. Season passes are now available, with prices ranging from $100 to $300 per day, and discounted ski days can be obtained through 'ski passport' programs for children in certain grades.

**Ski resorts begin to open with 'excellent conditions' on the highest slopes**
More than 20 ski areas in the Alps and Scandinavia have opened for the season, with glacier ski centers reporting 'excellent conditions'. Austria leads the way with seven open glaciers, including Sölden, Hintertux, and Stubai, which have over 30km, 20km, and 20km of slopes respectively. Switzerland and Italy also have several ski areas open, while France will not open any slopes until late November. Resorts in North America began opening on October 22, with Colorado's Wolf Creek being the first to open after a big temperature drop and 53cm snowfall. The La Niña weather system is expected to bring heavy snowfall to the Pacific Northwest, but drier conditions to the Rockies. Canada's Rockies have already seen their first snowfalls in late August, and snowfall has also occurred on the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts. 'It's an early gift from La Niña,' said resorts, referring to the first heavy snowfalls over the weekend of October 19 to 20.

**These 5 Utah ski areas have been nominated among the best in North America. Are they even the best in the state?**
Five Utah ski resorts, Alta Ski Area, Deer Valley Resort, Park City Mountain, Snowbasin, and Snowbird, have been nominated for USA Today's 10 Best in the Ski Resorts category. However, some argue that this list does not capture the best the state has to offer, as notable resorts like Powder Mountain, Brighton, and Solitude Mountain Resort were not included. According to Powder Mountain, both Brighton and Solitude were among the five snowiest resorts in North America last season. Voting in the category is open until November 11, and winners are expected to be announced on November 20. Interestingly, Utah ski resorts have struggled to gain recognition in the past, with Alta being the only Utah resort to reach the Top 10 in USA Today's poll in 2023, despite receiving a state record 903 inches of snow that season.

**Firefighters, resorts rejoice after productive winter storm; freeze warnings issued**
A winter storm warning remains in effect for southern Utah's mountains until noon Saturday, but Utah ski resorts and firefighters are thrilled with the storm's production. Alta received 9 inches of snow, while Cedar City and Oak City received 6 inches. The storm's highest totals were expected in elevations where there are few weather stations, such as King's Peak in the West Uintas. The storm was particularly good news for firefighters battling wildfires in the state, with precipitation, cloud cover, high humidity, and cool weather patterns aiding suppression efforts. 'This is a big, producing storm, and it's nice because we're coming off two weeks of quiet (conditions) and above-normal temperatures,' said KSL meteorologist Matt Johnson. Meanwhile, resorts were also thrilled with the storm as they prepare for the upcoming ski season, with several resorts intending to begin operations in November, conditions permitting.

**Snow’s on the way, but will Utah’s ski season still open on time?**
Utah is expecting a significant drop in temperature and up to a foot of snow in the mountains this week, which could bring an end to the late start of the season. Christine Kruse, a lead meteorologist at the National Weather Service bureau in Salt Lake City, said that the temperature drop will bring the state back to normal for mid-to-late October. Brian Head Resort, which had pegged Nov. 8 as its opening date, is confident that it will be able to open earlier due to its high elevation and the time it has had to prepare its snowmaking systems. The NWS predicts that Brian Head could get up to 10 inches of snow between Thursday night and Saturday morning. Other resorts in the state, such as Alta Ski Area and Park City Mountain, are also expecting significant snowfall, with up to 15 inches possible by Saturday. However, lower elevations will mostly experience the storm as rain, and it's unclear whether the state will be able to stay on schedule for the rest of the season.

It will be the first ski resort to open in the Dolomiti Superski area, which is celebrating its 50th winter season this year. The highlight will be on Friday, November 29, at 7 pm, with the opening of night skiing on the illuminated Oberholz piste at Obereggen, followed by the opening party at the Apres Ski Loox in the valley station. From Saturday, November 30, 2024 at 8:30 am, the lifts and slopes of Obereggen, Pampeago, and Predazzo, as well as the connecting lifts, will be open. Night skiing and sledding will be available on Tuesday and Friday evenings (from 7 pm to 10 pm) until March 28, 2025. The Latemar ski resort season will conclude on April 21, 2025. The 41st edition of the Obereggen Europa Cup slalom will take place on Monday, December 16, 2024 on the Maierl piste (maximum slope of 55%), serving as a prelude to the traditional World Cup slalom in Italy, which will take place in Alta Badia on December 22. In the 2023 edition, the slalom was won by Schmidiger of Switzerland, second place went to Amiez of France, and Rueland of Austria took third place. To celebrate the new season, the Obereggen Latemar Ag company will offer a special promotion for junior skiers, reducing the age limit for the special skipass from 18 to 16 years. This will help to strengthen the bond between the young generations and the historic ski clubs of Bolzano, Verona, Brescia, Mantova, Vicenza, Modena, and Reggio Emilia, which annually choose Obereggen, Pampeago, and Predazzo as their ideal destination for a day trip or more. Obereggen will start the 2024/2025 winter season with a new photovoltaic plant, aiming to cover an increasingly large share of its energy needs with renewable energy in the coming years. Additionally, the entire fleet of vehicles of the Obereggen Latemar AG company (equipment for the slopes and service vehicles) will be converted from conventional diesel to the eco-friendly alternative HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil).

In the 2023 edition, the winner of the Obereggen slalom was the Swiss skier Schmidiger, followed by the French skier Amiez and the Austrian skier Rueland. To celebrate the new season, the Obereggen Latemar Ag company will offer a special promotion for junior skiers, reducing the age for the special skipass from 18 to 16 years. This will help to strengthen the bond between the younger generations and the historic ski clubs of Bolzano, Verona, Brescia, Mantova, Vicenza, Modena, and Reggio Emilia, which annually choose Obereggen, Pampeago, and Predazzo as their ideal destination for a day trip or more. Obereggen will start the 2024/2025 winter season with a new photovoltaic plant, aiming to cover an increasingly large portion of its energy needs with renewable energy in the coming years. Additionally, the entire fleet of vehicles of the Obereggen Latemar AG company (equipment for the slopes and service vehicles) will be converted from conventional diesel to the eco-friendly alternative HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil).
