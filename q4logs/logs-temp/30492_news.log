**Who is Sunita Williams and why are the Starliner astronauts stuck in space?**
Astronauts Sunita 'Suni' Williams and Barry 'Butch' Wilmore have been stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) since June, after Boeing's Starliner spacecraft left them behind. They are expected to return to Earth in February 2025, aboard the Crew-9 mission Dragon capsule. However, there are concerns about their health after spending so long in zero gravity. Pulmonologist Vinay Gupta has expressed concerns about Williams' weight loss, suggesting that she may not be consuming enough calories to match her increased energy expenditure. Gupta stated, 'What you're seeing... is somebody that I think is experiencing the natural stresses of living at a very high altitude, even in a pressurized cabin, for extended periods.' Astronauts face a range of health risks in space, including muscle atrophy, bone density loss, and increased exposure to cosmic and solar radiation. However, it appears that Williams' weight loss is the only significant health concern at present. Williams and Wilmore will have spent around 250 days in space by the time they return, but this is not the longest time an astronaut has been in space. The record-holding American astronaut is Frank Rubio, who spent 371 days in space between 2022 and 2023.

**Remember those Starliner astronauts still in space? Don't worry, they can vote.**
Four American astronauts, including two Boeing Starliner astronauts, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, will be in space during the 2024 presidential election and will be able to cast their votes from orbit. The process of voting from space involves encrypted ballots flowing from satellites to a ground antenna before being received by county clerks to be tallied. As NASA explains, 'It's a very important role that we all play as citizens, to be included in those elections, and NASA makes it very easy for us to do that,' said Wilmore. 'Looking forward to being able to vote from space, which is pretty cool,' added Williams. This process has been in place since 1997, when astronaut David Wolf became the first American to cast a ballot from space. Since then, several astronauts have voted from orbit, including Kate Rubins, who voted in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. The process involves filling out an electronic absentee ballot and using unique credentials to access the ballot and cast their votes from the space station.

**Why Sunita Williams will remain in space till Feb 2025 despite SpaceX Dragon docking at ISS**
Despite the successful docking of the SpaceX Dragon capsule at the International Space Station (ISS), NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will remain in space until February 2025. According to NASA, 'Wilmore and Williams will continue their work formally as part of the Expedition 71/72 crew through February 2025.' The two astronauts will return to Earth aboard a Dragon spacecraft with two other crew members assigned to the SpaceX Crew-9 mission. Williams and Wilmore are part of a crew of 10 astronauts, including Oleg Kononenko, Nikolai Chub, Tracy Caldwell Dyson, Michael Barratt, Matthew Dominick, Jeanette Epps, and Alexander Grebenkin. The ISS is well-stocked and efficiently supplied, and the crew capsules can function as 'lifeboats' in case of an emergency. SpaceX Dragon will be the return vehicle for Williams and Wilmore, who were previously stranded inside the ISS due to thruster failures and helium gas leaks with Boeing's Starliner.

**NASA Astronauts Stranded on ISS Due to SpaceX Technical Issue**
NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are currently stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) due to a technical issue with the Boeing Starliner capsule of SpaceX (a faulty engine and helium loss). Originally, their stay was supposed to be 8 days, but it has been extended to 8 months after deciding to return the Starliner to Earth without crew on board. Although a SpaceX Crew Dragon arrived with NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov on board, Wilmore and Williams will not be able to return home until Hague and Gorbunov's return in February 2025. The arrival of the backup space suits The backup space suits for Wilmore and Williams were transported to the ISS by the Crew Dragon capsule, whose launch was originally scheduled for last Thursday, then postponed to Saturday. This delay in the launch of the Crew Dragon explains why the capsule arrived at the space station later than planned. Despite the presence of the backup suits, Wilmore and Williams will still have to remain on board the ISS until the completion of Hague and Gorbunov's mission, extending their stay in space far beyond the initial expectations and schedule. The SpaceX and private players' space race The possibility for astronauts to have more options for returning from the ISS demonstrates the significant progress made by both private space programs and government programs. Companies like SpaceX, the leader in the private aerospace sector, regularly launch weekly rockets and have perfected the technology for recovering the first stage of their Falcon 9 rocket, the most used. Other private companies like Rocket Lab are also advancing rapidly in this field, while Chinese realities are aiming to reach SpaceX's milestones. Despite geopolitical tensions, Russia remains a reliable option for transporting astronauts to and from the ISS thanks to its Soyuz rockets launched from the Kazakh cosmodrome of Baikonur.

**Stuck NASA astronauts welcome new ride home**
NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been stuck at the International Space Station since June, welcomed their new ride home with the arrival of a SpaceX capsule on Sunday. The capsule, carrying NASA's Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency's Alexander Gorbunov, will remain at the space station until February, extending Wilmore and Williams' stay by over eight months. NASA switched Wilmore and Williams to SpaceX following concerns about the safety of their Boeing Starliner capsule, which experienced thruster failures and helium leaks during its first test flight with a crew. NASA's associate administrator, Jim Free, said, 'We're a long way from saying, 'Hey, we're writing off Boeing.' The arrival of the fresh astronauts means the four who have been up there since March can now return to Earth in their own SpaceX capsule in just over a week. However, SpaceX has halted all Falcon launches until it figures out what went wrong with the rocket's spent upper stage, which ended up outside its targeted impact zone in the Pacific.

**SpaceX Rescue Capsule Arrives at ISS, Bringing Astronauts Closer to Home**
Two astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been stranded on the International Space Station since December, are one step closer to returning to Earth with the arrival of a SpaceX rescue capsule. The capsule, launched by Elon Musk's company on Saturday evening, has a reduced crew of two astronauts and two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams, who will return to Earth in February. The NASA changed Wilmore and Williams to SpaceX after concerns about the safety of the Boeing Starliner capsule they were using to travel to the ISS. 'I just want to welcome our new crewmates,' said Williams, the commander of the space station, as Hague and Gorbunov floated inside and were hugged by the nine astronauts waiting for them. The NASA likes to replace the station's crews every six months or so. SpaceX has provided the 'taxi' service since the company's first astronaut flight in 2020. The NASA also contracted Boeing for the transport flights after the retirement of the space shuttles, but a software defect and other problems with the Starliner caused years of delays and over $1 billion in repairs.

**Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to Return to Earth in February 2025**
The two American astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who arrived on the International Space Station (ISS) on June 6 with the Boeing Starliner, but were stranded due to technical issues, now have a spacecraft to return to Earth. The Crew 9 mission, which launched on Saturday from Cape Canaveral, has two astronauts - Nick Hague of NASA and Russian Aleksandr Gorbunov - instead of four, leaving two seats available for their American colleagues. The return of the four astronauts is expected in February 2025, after 8 months of a journey that was supposed to last 8 days. According to NASA, 'They will return with SpaceX.' NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said, 'The decision to leave Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams on the International Space Station and return the Starliner without crew is the result of our commitment to safety.' The decision was made after Boeing 'worked hard with NASA to obtain the necessary data to make this decision.' Nelson added, 'We have already lost two shuttles, we want to understand the root causes and improve the design so that Starliner can play an important role in ensuring access to the ISS.'

**SpaceX launches ship to bring back astronauts stranded on International Space Station**
SpaceX launched a Dragon spacecraft on September 30, 2024, to bring back astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been stranded on the International Space Station for eight months. The Dragon crew of two, Nick Hague and Aleksandr Gorbunov, are scheduled to dock at the International Space Station on Sunday at 5:30 p.m. The launch was necessary due to delays with the Boeing Starliner's unmanned return to Earth earlier this month, which revealed helium leaks and malfunctions with some of the spacecraft's thrusters. Boeing has lost at least $1.4 billion on the Starliner program, with annual losses ranging from $57 million to $489 million. The company is also facing a strike from 33,000 workers, production shutdowns, and a potential downgrade from S&P Global and Moody's, which would bring the company's rating down to junk.

**SpaceX and NASA Launch Historic Rescue Mission for Stranded Astronauts**
The SpaceX Crew-9 mission, scheduled to bring astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore back to Earth, is set to launch on Saturday (28). This mission marks a significant milestone in the collaboration between NASA and SpaceX, two companies that have continuously revolutionized space travel. The mission will be commanded by Nick Hague and will feature cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov as the mission specialist. The two astronauts have been on the ISS since June after the inaugural flight of the Starliner spacecraft. Due to technical issues, their mission was originally planned to last only eight days, but they were left 'stranded' in space when the Starliner returned to Earth alone. This unexpected situation highlights the importance of safety and redundancy in spaceflight plans. The Crew Dragon spacecraft, designed to transport up to seven astronauts, is one of the most innovative advancements in space technology. With advanced safety systems and cutting-edge technologies, the spacecraft is ready to bring the astronauts back to Earth safely. 'This is not just a rescue mission, but also a testament to the progress we've made in conquering space,' said NASA. The mission is a significant step forward in the continued exploration of space, and it will be an exciting event to watch on Saturday.
