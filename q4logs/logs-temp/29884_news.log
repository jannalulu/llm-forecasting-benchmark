**Anthropic to Soon Release Claude 3.5 Opus**
Anthropic is planning to release Claude 3.5 Opus, its most capable model, soon, according to chief Dario Amodei. This comes after the release of Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Haiku in July. Amodei said that the company's plan is to 'shift' the capabilities of existing models, making them more powerful, before releasing an upgraded Opus. The delay in releasing Opus 3.5 is due to the need for excess computational power in pre-training, rigorous safety testing, and Anthropic's desire to build a new version of Opus that solves newer problems. Anthropic has been releasing new features, including a Computer Use feature and a Visual PDF tool, which may change the state of human-computer interaction. With OpenAI set to release o1 and Google releasing Gemini 2.0, the AI community is expecting a new battle of flagship models.

**Amazon Considers Increasing Investment in Anthropic with a Condition**
Amazon is considering increasing its investment in Anthropic, a competitor to OpenAI, in a move that could represent billions of dollars more for the artificial intelligence startup. This would not be the first time Amazon has supported Anthropic, as they signed a $4 billion initial agreement in 2022. However, this time Amazon has put a key condition: that Anthropic use Amazon's hardware processing developed by Amazon and hosted on its Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform to train its AI models. According to reports from early this year, Anthropic projects a spending of over $2.7 billion in 2024 just to scale its AI technologies. In this context, Amazon's financial boost could be an essential help for the startup, especially now that it is exploring a valuation of $40 billion and needs to secure funds as soon as possible. With this new injection of capital, Amazon seems not only willing to increase its investment but also to integrate Anthropic more deeply into its technological ecosystem, intensifying the competition in the world of artificial intelligence.

According to Antonov, the company's shareholder has set the direction for the company's development. Currently, the company is working on calculating the financial model for going public. In October, the company announced plans to go public by the end of 2026. In December 2021, the then-CEO Svetlana Vinogradova stated that the company was considering the possibility of conducting an IPO in the second half of 2022. Prior to this, the company underwent a reorganization from a private limited company to a public joint-stock company.

**Rolf Delays IPO Plans to 2026-2027 Amid Central Bank's Interest Rate Hike**
Rolf, Russia's largest auto dealer by revenue, has delayed its initial public offering (IPO) plans to 2026-2027 due to the Central Bank's interest rate hike. The company's CEO, Roman Antonov, announced this on Friday. 'Our shareholder has given us a direction, and now we are working as a team to determine how we want to enter the public market, with what amount of financing. We are now calculating the financial model. When we exit, it will be in 2026 or 2027, and we are currently working on the strategy,' Antonov said. He noted that the key interest rate has a significant impact on the company's actions related to the IPO. Rolf had previously announced plans to expand its presence in Russian regions and conduct an IPO in 2025-26. However, the Central Bank raised the key interest rate to 21% on October 25, which has affected the company's plans. 'We plan to hold the IPO in 2025-2026. It is clear that all our investment projects require financing. We have experience with issuing bonds in 2019-2020. The increased interest in our company allows us to be confident that the IPO will be successful. This will increase our value, provide additional resources for development, and motivate our employees,' said Svetlana Vinogradova, first deputy CEO of Rolf, on October 8.

**Google says its next-gen AI agents won't launch until 2025 at the earliest | TechCrunch**
Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the company's next-gen AI agents, including Project Astra, won't launch until 2025 at the earliest. Project Astra is a range of technologies that enable AI to see and reason about the world, including smartphone apps that can recognize objects and answer questions. Google had previously planned to launch a consumer-focused agent experience as early as December, but this now seems unlikely. Anthropic, a company with a large generative AI model, has struggled with basic tasks, illustrating the challenges of building AI agents.

**Cisco CEO: 2025 is the year of our AI rolling thunder**
Cisco unveiled two new AI products, a high-density GPU server and 'AI PODS,' at its annual Partner Summit conference in Los Angeles. The products are designed to handle intensive AI workloads powered by Nvidia's accelerated computing. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said, 'It's really an important event for us, and we've taken the opportunity here to start what is really a rolling thunder of announcements around AI infrastructure.' The company has shipped $1 billion of orders to five of the six top hyperscalers and expects another $1 billion in its current fiscal year. Robbins believes 2025 will be the year of enterprise application, with companies figuring out use cases for AI models like ChatGPT and Anthropic. Cisco's stock has risen nearly 20% in the past three months, outperforming the S&P 500. Analysts are optimistic about the company's potential, citing upside in revenues and margins in FY25.

**Anthropic unveils upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet**
Anthropic has unveiled an upgraded version of its AI chatbot, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which can now interact with a computer like a human, performing tasks such as filling out forms and conducting online research. According to Mike Krieger, Anthropic's chief product officer, this technology has the potential to lead to more innovative products and streamlined back-office processes. The U.S. market for AI software development is growing rapidly, with an expected revenue of $214 billion by the end of 2024 and $1.3 trillion by 2030. However, consumers remain cautious, with over 75% expressing concerns about the trustworthiness of AI-generated information.

**UK's CMA to Investigate Alphabet's $2.3 Billion Investment in Anthropic**
The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has announced that it will investigate Alphabet's $2.3 billion investment in the AI startup Anthropic. The CMA stated that it has 'sufficient information' to begin a preliminary investigation into whether Alphabet's investment in Claude AI chatbot harms competition in the UK markets. The CMA divides its merger investigations into two stages: a preliminary review to determine if there is enough evidence for a deeper investigation, and a second stage where the government gathers as much evidence as possible. After the second stage, the CMA will ultimately decide on the regulatory outcome. The investigation will officially begin on Friday and by December 19, the CMA will decide whether to move to the second stage. Google spokesperson said, 'Google is committed to building more open and innovative AI systems in the world.' 'Anthropic is free to use multiple cloud services and we do not demand exclusive technical rights.' The CMA was approached for comment and will update this story if they respond. TechCrunch notes that Alphabet invested $300 million in Anthropic in early 2023, and later that year, it was said to be supporting the AI startup with an additional $2 billion. This can be classified as a 'near-complete merger', where deep-pocketed tech companies control emerging startups through strategic investments, hiring founders and technical employees. Amazon invested more in Anthropic: $4 billion. After the initial public comment period, the CMA refused to investigate this investment last month. The CMA stated that Amazon avoided Alphabet's fate at least partially due to its current rules: Anthropic's UK business did not exceed £70 million, and the two did not combine to form 25% or more of the region's supplies (in this case, Master's programs in AI and robotics).

**OpenAI tipped to launch its next-gen AI model in December  --  but Sam Altman calls this 'fake news'**
OpenAI is reportedly planning to release its next-generation GPT-5 AI model, codenamed Orion, in December. However, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has denied this report, calling it 'fake news'. The new model is expected to deliver groundbreaking features, but will initially only be released to partner companies, not the consumer ChatGPT market. Microsoft, OpenAI's largest investor, may be given an inside track on the release, and could deliver a version for Azure in November. The AI arms race is heating up, with Anthropic launching a new feature called Computer Use, which lets its Claude Sonnet 3.5 model take control of a computer and complete actions on the web. As OpenAI prepares for its IPO, the 'will they, won't they' brouhaha surrounding the release of the new model is unlikely to affect its opening stock price.

**British regulator is considering Alphabet's deal with Anthropic**
Britain's antitrust watchdog, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), has opened an investigation into Alphabet, Google's parent company, partnering with startup Anthropic. The regulator has been examining the deal since July and will make a first-stage decision by December 19, deciding whether to continue the investigation. The deal, worth $500 million, was secured by Anthropic last year, with Alphabet promising an additional $1.5 billion over time. Regulators worldwide are increasingly concerned about deals between big tech companies and small startups, following the AI boom sparked by Microsoft-backed OpenAI's release of ChatGPT nearly two years ago.

**This Week in AI: The AI agents cometh**
Anthropic has released its newest AI model, 3.5 Sonnet, which can interact with the web and desktop apps by clicking and typing. While it's not perfect, the model could be transformative in the workplace. Anthropic's ambitions in the AI agent market, which some analysts believe could be worth $50 billion by 2030, signify the company's commitment to developing 'agentic' technologies. However, the model's failure rates, such as completing less than half of airline booking tasks successfully, raise questions about its reliability. Despite this, businesses are showing a willingness to give AI agents a try, with 48% of enterprises beginning to deploy AI agents and another third actively exploring agentic solutions. News includes protests against unlicensed use of creative works for AI training, Meta's expansion of facial recognition tests, and OpenAI's new hires and preview of a dedicated Windows app for ChatGPT.

Speaking to CNBC, Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's Chief Science Officer, explained that the system can manage 'tens or even hundreds of steps' to complete tasks. The tool was initially made available to early access partners like Amazon and companies such as Asana, Canva, and Notion, and is expected to be extended to consumers and businesses over the coming months or by early next year.

**'ДОМ.РФ' Plans to Go Public with IPO in 2025**
The state corporation 'ДОМ.РФ' has confirmed its plans to conduct an initial public offering (IPO) in 2025, with the Ministry of Finance supporting the plan. According to Anton Siluanov, Minister of Finance, there is a possibility of privatizing the state corporation through an IPO. Vasily Mutko, head of 'ДОМ.РФ', noted that the placement of shares may take place in the second half of 2025. Artem Fedorov, head of the subsidiary bank 'ДОМ.РФ', emphasized that for further growth, the company needs to consider going public and did not rule out the possibility of conducting an IPO next year. Alexei Moiseev, Deputy Minister of Finance, confirmed these plans, adding that the placement of shares will be a significant event for the Russian market. He noted the company's high financial performance and good dividends, but expressed regret about the need for partial sale. To successfully implement the IPO, several procedural issues need to be resolved, including the conversion of the company into a public joint-stock company and changes to the legislation that currently requires 100% state ownership of 'ДОМ.РФ'. The volume of the planned IPO has not been determined yet, and Moiseev noted that the desire to place a large package may face limitations on the Russian market. The decision on the size of the shares to be placed will depend on market capacity and demand. Moiseev also noted that the question of distributing the funds from the placement - whether to the budget or for the company's recapitalization - remains open. He confirmed that the task of conducting an IPO in the second half of 2025 is set for 'ДОМ.РФ'.

However, the market situation is uncertain, and investors may prefer to put their money on a deposit with a low risk. But if the interest rate goes down, as the group hopes it will in the spring, they plan to enter the market in the fall, as explained by Romanashov, 'Unfortunately, the market situation is ambiguous. With such rates, it's easier for investors to put their money on a deposit and live risk-free. But if the rate goes down, and we hope it will be in the spring, then we plan to enter the market in the fall'.

**Companies Postpone IPOs Until 2025 Amid Low Interest Rates and High Demand for Fixed Income**
Several companies have announced plans to go public in 2024, but the low interest rates and high demand for fixed income have discouraged others from doing so. According to Javier Cabrera, an analyst at Norbolsa, 'the current context invites companies to postpone their IPOs until 2025. The market has already discounted three rate cuts in the next four meetings of the European Central Bank.' Sara Hernández, director of analysis at Norbolsa, also notes that 'many investors have bet on fixed income this year, and it's unlikely that more companies will be able to complete their IPOs this year.' Puig, the first company to go public in 2024, suffered a setback in its first results as a listed company and reduced its profit by 27% in the first six months of the year due to the costs of its IPO. The company's shares have fallen by over 17% since its debut and currently trade at around 20 euros. Other companies, such as Cirsa, Tendam, and Astara, have also explored plans to go public, but it's unlikely that there will be new additions to the market before the end of the year.

**How the VC world is viewing AI**
Torch Capital founder Jon Keidan believes OpenAI is shifting from a nonprofit to a for-profit structure to compete with other AI companies like Anthropic and xAI. Keidan says, 'As the competition has gotten more severe, OpenAI has shown a lot of success. They've developed product after product released successfully, and I think they're just trying to equalize the playing field.' He notes that OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman would have equity in the company if it becomes for-profit. Keidan is excited about AI's potential, saying, 'The capabilities and the adoption are through the roof, and it's going to absolutely be a moment much like in the 2010s when we saw mobile, social, cloud, and location converge.' However, he cautions that it's still early and difficult to determine the competitive advantages of AI companies. Keidan also notes that private AI companies are unlikely to announce initial public offerings (IPOs) anytime soon, as they have raised a lot of money and don't want to be distracted by an IPO.

**Anthropic reportedly in early talks to raise new funding on up to $40B valuation**
Anthropic, a general artificial intelligence startup, is reportedly in early talks to raise new funding on a valuation of up to $40 billion, according to The Information. While talks are still in the early stages, it's unclear whether investors will agree to such a high valuation. Anthropic is scheduled to present to investors at Morgan Stanley's private tech conference next month. The company has already raised about $7.6 billion, including forward commitments, with Amazon.com Inc. being its largest investor. Any new round of funding could involve Amazon again, given the increasing partnership between the two companies. Anthropic's large language models are already available on Amazon Bedrock, and the company is reportedly set to power newer versions of Amazon's Alexa smart assistant.
