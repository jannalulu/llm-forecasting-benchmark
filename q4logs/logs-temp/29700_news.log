**Top Republican privately backing Thune to succeed McConnell in GOP leader race**
National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Chairman Steve Daines is privately urging Senate Republicans to vote for Senate Minority Whip John Thune to succeed Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as the head of the party. Daines had previously considered running for the position but confirmed in October that he would not seek it. The leader position is also being sought by Sens. John Cornyn and Rick Scott. McConnell, who is retiring, will not be endorsing a successor. President-elect Trump has not publicly weighed in on the matter, but had previously expressed support for Daines to run for the position. Only three senators have made public endorsements, with Sens. Markwayne Mullin and Mike Rounds supporting Thune, and Sen. Ron Johnson backing Scott.

**Republicans brace for Mitch McConnell succession fight with Senate won**
With Republicans regaining control of the Senate, a leadership succession fight is brewing. Three contenders are vying to succeed Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.): Minority Whip John Thune, John Cornyn, and Rick Scott. The leadership vote is scheduled for Nov. 13. McConnell, who announced his departure in February, has refrained from meddling in the race. Trump has declined to publicly endorse a contender, but his influence is still significant. Thune said, 'The president obviously has tremendous influence, if he chooses to use it.' Cornyn and Scott have both vowed to help enact Trump's agenda, with Cornyn stating, 'It is critically important that the Senate is prepared to enact his pro-growth agenda from day one.' Scott's spokesperson declared that he 'will bring Florida's winning conservative record to Washington and be a true ally to President Trump to execute his agenda and fundamentally change the direction of this country.' McConnell, who is widely seen as a member of the traditional wing of the Republican Party, is set to leave office at the start of 2027.

**Who will replace Mitch McConnell as Senate GOP leader?**
With Mitch McConnell stepping down as Senate GOP leader, a trio of candidates has emerged as possible successors: South Dakota Sen. John Thune, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, and Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso. All three have pledged to work closely with Trump to get his agenda through Congress. Thune, the Senate minority whip, defines himself by the party's traditional values and has at times defied Trump's wishes. Cornyn has been actively campaigning with Trump, attending rallies and fundraising events. Barrasso, an orthopedic surgeon and former state lawmaker, has risen to the third-ranking GOP position in the U.S. Senate and is the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

**Who will replace Mitch McConnell? Race to be next GOP Senate leader**
Senators John Thune, John Cornyn, and Rick Scott have announced their intentions to replace Mitch McConnell as the Senate Republican leader. The internal vote will take place on November 13. According to Mark Shanahan, associate professor of political engagement at the U.K.'s University of Surrey, the race 'realistically' comes down to Thune and Cornyn. Shanahan said, 'At this stage, Thune probably has the upper hand. As Republican Whip, he's de facto number two in the GOP pecking order in the Senate, and is seen as both a strong and active campaigner and fundraiser.' Cornyn would bring 'considerable Texan wealth' to GOP coffers if he was to land the role. Scott is a top ally of Donald Trump and a frequent critic of McConnell. The winner of the leadership contest will be Senate majority leader after the election, and thus will fulfill a crucial role. Neither Thune or Cornyn is close to Donald Trump, and may have to act as a necessary brake on some of his more outlandish proposals if he returns to the White House.

**Daines signals privately he will back Thune in GOP leadership race**
National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Chair Steve Daines has privately signaled to colleagues that he will support Senate Republican Whip John Thune in the race to become next Senate Republican leader. Daines's public support would be a promising development for Thune, who is locked in a tough race with Sen. John Cornyn to succeed Sen. Mitch McConnell as Senate Republican leader next year. Thune is expected to carve out a special leadership position for Daines if he wins the race. Republican senators expect Thune to win the leadership post, but the race remains too close to call as many Republican senators are waiting on the outcome of the 2024 election before committing to either Thune or Cornyn.

**With McConnell MIA, his potential replacements step in to bolster battleground Republicans**
As Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell steps down, his potential replacements, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, South Dakota Sen. John Thune, and Florida Sen. Rick Scott, are vying to fill the vacuum. They are dumping big sums of money into key Senate races to help the GOP win back the majority. According to sources, Cornyn has raised nearly $850,000 for Scott and more than $715,000 for Ted Cruz's races, while Thune has raised six figures for Cruz and Scott through his Joint Fundraising Committees. The next Senate leader will need to have strong fundraising ability and a good relationship with former President Donald Trump, who has yet to weigh in on the election. Trump's endorsement is highly coveted, and the three contenders have publicly backed him against Kamala Harris. However, their voting records resemble McConnell's, and some Republicans worry that they may continue to sabotage the party.

**Can the GOP reclaim the U.S. Senate? Kentucky's Mitch McConnell sees 'great' odds**
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell believes that private Republican polls show a similar picture to public polls, with the 2024 presidential race tied in seven battleground states: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada. McConnell, who has access to polling conducted by the Senate Leadership Fund, feels 'great' about the GOP's chances in Ohio, Montana, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. He considers the West Virginia seat nearly secure and sees Montana as their second-best opportunity, where Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is facing a tough challenge in a state that will likely vote for Donald Trump. McConnell declined to say who he would support to succeed him as GOP leader, stating that both John Cornyn and John Thune are 'terrific' and will do an outstanding job.

**Mitch McConnell Exits Senate Leadership in November, John Thune Will Likely Replace - The Last Refuge**
Mitch McConnell is stepping down as Senate Majority Leader in November, and John Thune is likely to replace him. Thune has been groomed by McConnell and has the support of the Republican establishment. However, President Trump has leverage in the situation, as he has met with Thune and discussed his expectations. Trump is focused on getting the right people into Senate committees, particularly the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), where Marco Rubio is the vice chair. Trump is looking for a chairman who will give him the opportunity for success, and Rubio is seen as a compromise candidate. The article argues that the focus should be on getting the right people into Senate committees, rather than trying to stop Thune from becoming the next Senate Majority Leader. 'I think we have an understanding, and it's professional,' Thune said of Trump in a recent interview, calling the Mar-a-Lago visit important in establishing a personal rapport. 'We both know we have a job to do.'

**Mitch McConnell Is Stepping Down!**
Mitch McConnell has announced his retirement as Senate Republican Leader in November. The news is not new, as he first announced his decision in February. The focus now is on who will replace him, with candidates such as Rand Paul, Mike Lee, and Ted Cruz being mentioned. Senator Tommy Tuberville has stated that he will not support anyone who opposes President Trump for the role, and has spoken to potential candidates John Thune and John Cornyn. Meanwhile, some are questioning McConnell's health and ability to continue serving, citing incidents where he appeared to 'freeze' in public. A poll is also asking whether McConnell should be removed from Congress.

**The next big dilemma for the U.S. Senate GOP: Who should lead them in 2025 and beyond?**
U.S. Senate Republicans will soon choose a new leader to replace Mitch McConnell, who has led the party since 2007. Three candidates, John Cornyn, Rick Scott, and John Thune, are vying for the position. Senators are looking for a leader who can move legislation through the chamber, listen to members, and forge strong ties with the incoming administration. Some key characteristics mentioned by senators include being a 'workhorse', being able to negotiate bipartisan deals, having the ability to get along well with President Trump, and being willing to test assumptions against critics' arguments. The next leader will face challenges such as navigating a divided government, confirming executive branch nominees, and potentially a Supreme Court nominee. Senators are also looking for a leader who can build consensus, listen to members, and communicate effectively.

**McConnell’s Exit Sparks GOP Leadership Race**
Sen. Mitch McConnell's upcoming departure as the Republican Senate leader in November has sparked a leadership race among several senators. Sens. John Cornyn and John Thune are the front-runners for the position. According to an anonymous former Senate GOP aide, Sen. Thune has the 'policy and political chops and widespread support inside the conference to get the job' due to his years of learning from Sen. McConnell, who is known for his 'floor strategy and tactics.'

**McConnell's Exit Sparks GOP Leadership Race**
Sen. Mitch McConnell's decision to vacate his seat in January 2027 has sparked a leadership race among Republican senators. Sens. John Cornyn and John Thune are the front-runners, with Thune being seen as a strong contender due to his policy and political experience, as well as his widespread support within the conference. An anonymous former Senate GOP aide said, 'Sen. Thune sticks out as someone with the policy and political chops and widespread support inside the conference to get the job.' However, some analysts believe that a Trump election win could lead to a third candidate being endorsed by the former President, or a public pledge of loyalty being extracted from Cornyn and Thune. Jason Cabel Roe attributed the outcome to the presidential election, saying, 'I think it will come down to who the caucus thinks can effectively coexist with a President Trump, if he wins, or who will be better prepared to stop a [Kamala] Harris agenda, if she wins.'

**The intense election race that no one's paying attention to**
Senator John Cornyn and Senator John Thune have emerged as the frontrunners to replace Mitch McConnell as the Republican leader in the Senate. According to a former senior GOP Senate aide, Thune 'sticks out as someone with the policy and political chops and widespread support inside the conference to get the job.' McConnell, who has led his party in the Senate since 2007, is stepping down. Political analysts find the choices of Cornyn and Thune 'conventional' options, but are unable to name alternatives that could factor into the contest. Gregory Koger, a political scientist, believes that if Donald Trump wins the presidential election, he may try to support a third candidate or extract a public pledge of personal loyalty from Cornyn and Thune. Koger notes that the election to replace McConnell will be 'critical to the future of the Senate as a legislative body.' Jason Cabel Roe, a political and communications strategist, calls McConnell 'one of a kind' and notes that Thune and Cornyn have decades of experience in the Senate and are better prepared to lead the caucus.

**Lame-Duck McConnell Lashes Out at Trump as Senate Turns Away From His Leadership Style**
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has lashed out at former President Donald Trump and other Republicans, calling Trump a 'sleazeball' and the MAGA movement 'completely wrong' in a new biography. McConnell's comments have sparked a backlash from Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who is demanding that the three declared candidates for Senate GOP leadership - Sens. Rick Scott, R-Fla., John Thune, R-S.D., and John Cornyn, R-Texas - weigh in on McConnell's remarks. Lee said that McConnell's attacks on Trump and Scott are 'indefensible' and that the Senate GOP leader is supposed to help Republicans, not undermine them. Scott responded to McConnell's comments, saying that he believes in supporting Republican candidates and that McConnell's attacks are 'shocking.' Thune, meanwhile, focused on electing a strong Senate Republican majority. McConnell's comments have been seen as a possible impetus for his possible successors to distance themselves from his style of leadership.

**McConnell attacked Trump. Here's how his potential successors responded. | Blaze Media**
After Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell disavowed former President Donald Trump and his supporters, potential successors Rick Scott, John Thune, and John Cornyn responded with mixed messages. Scott strongly criticized McConnell, saying he was 'shocked' by the 'attack' on Trump and expressing his support for Trump's 'dramatic change' agenda. Thune, on the other hand, reaffirmed his support for Trump while focusing on winning the Senate. Cornyn withheld a response, directing readers to his previous endorsement of Trump. 'While Leader McConnell and I have fundamental disagreements, I am shocked that he would attack a fellow Republican senator and the Republican nominee for president just two weeks out from an election,' Scott said in a statement. 'I believe we should be talking about solutions, he doesn't,' Scott continued. 'I support Donald Trump and his work to fundamentally change the way Washington operates, he doesn't. I believe we could support the candidates Republican voters choose, he doesn't.' Thune stated, 'Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States, which is why I'm focused on electing a strong Senate Republican majority that can hit the ground running and work with him to secure our borders, create more opportunities for families, and strengthen American businesses.'

**McConnell, Tillis lead charge against Republican leadership overhaul**
Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell is set to leave his position after nearly 18 years, and one of his final tasks will be to prevent what he sees as a weakening of the job. McConnell believes that the majority leader's ability to shut down an open amendment process on the floor is necessary due to individual senators' power in the unanimous consent-based Senate. He warned potential successors against making concessions to win votes, referencing former Speaker Kevin McCarthy's downfall. The three candidates vying to succeed McConnell - Sen. Rick Scott, Sen. John Cornyn, and Senate Minority Whip John Thune - are proposing varying degrees of changes to the leadership structure that would empower rank-and-file senators. McConnell stated, 'You've watched it over and over again: One senator has an objection. The majority leader says we're open for amendments. That doesn't mean you're open for amendments.' He also said, 'I want whoever has this job to have some clout. When you have narrow majorities, you've seen in the House what could happen. Take all the power away from the leader and what happens? Chaos.'

**Sen. Thune Aims to Shore Up GOP Leader Job**
Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., is running to become the leader of the Republican conference, succeeding Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is stepping down. Thune has proposed democratizing the GOP conference, allowing an open floor process and giving more powers to individual senators. He has met with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who has proposed rules to decentralize leadership power. Thune told Punchbowl, 'Give me a chance, and I can show you how we do things. A lot of this is style, it's the way that you go about leadership.' He expressed optimism about the Senate races in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which could help Republicans flip the majority, but noted that Arizona senate races are 'close, margin-of-error races.'

**Mike Lee lays out demands for McConnell successor**
Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) has laid out a series of proposals to decentralize power inside the Senate Republican Conference, taking it away from the office of outgoing Leader Mitch McConnell. Lee's proposals, which he believes will 'strengthen the Senate, empower individual members, and ensure that the voices of the American people are heard once more,' include changes to Senate and GOP Conference procedures. Lee's ideas are seen as a roadmap for winning the support of conservative senators, who are believed to be a key bloc in the race to succeed McConnell. While Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) is seen as the most solicitous of conservatives, Lee's proposals may be an attempt to exert leverage in a second-ballot race involving Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and John Thune (R-S.D.), who are seen as more natural heirs to McConnell's leadership style.

Geoffrey Antell, the chief of staff to Senate Republican Whip John Thune (S.D.), is known for his strong policy chops and ability to keep bills moving on the floor. With Republicans expected to take back control of the Senate in November, Thune is a leading candidate to take over for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), and Antell is likely to be running the show. Thune praised Antell's wealth of experience, including his time as assistant to then-Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and trade counsel on the House Ways and Means Committee. Antell is highly respected among his Senate colleagues for his steady hand, calm demeanor, and honest conversations, which have earned him the reputation as a 'guy who says, 'This is what we have to do,' and doesn't panic.'

**S.D. senator takes on Cornyn for leadership post**
Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, is running for the Senate Republican leadership post, a position that has been held by Sen. Mitch McConnell for the longest tenure in Senate history. Thune, 63, has approached the contest with quiet intensity, fueled by his aversion to losing, which he learned on the basketball court and track of Murdo's high school. Thune acknowledges moments of doubt about his place in the party and has had to navigate a delicate pose, contrasting Trump's style of politics while stopping short of direct confrontations. Thune has pledged a record-setting $4 million to the Senate GOP's campaign arm and has been crisscrossing the country to boost Republicans' bid to win a Senate majority. Thune's campaign is built on his reputation as a driven competitor, yet someone who also values forthrightness, teamwork, and humility. He has also emphasized the importance of democratic norms and the rule of law, stating that 'the Constitution, the rule of law, governs this country. That's our bedrock principle, and we can't deviate from that.'

Sen. John Thune, 63, is running for the Republican Senate leadership position, a move that has sparked uncertainty among Senate Republicans. Thune, who has a reputation for being a driven competitor, has pledged a record-setting $4 million to the Senate GOP's campaign arm and has been crisscrossing the country to boost Republicans' bid to win a Senate majority. Despite his efforts to contrast with Donald Trump's style of politics, Thune has stopped short of direct confrontations with the former president, who has tried to recruit a primary opponent against him in the past. Thune acknowledges that Trump can be trusted with the presidency, but also notes that the transfer of power 'was hard, painful and tumultuous in many ways.' Thune's campaign is fueled by his aversion to losing, a trait he learned on the basketball court and track of his high school in Murdo, South Dakota. 'You tire of just the day-to-day combat,' Thune said of his deliberations. 'I may not be best-suited to the times in terms of the style, the way I do things. But I just felt like the country was going to need some common-sense leadership, particularly if Sen. McConnell stepped aside.'

**Thune transfers $4 million to Senate Republicans as leader race heats back up**
Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-SD) transferred $4 million to the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), the largest transfer in the organization's history. This move is part of the battle over who will succeed Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) as GOP leader. Thune also set the previous record, $2 million, in 2016. Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) announced a max-out leadership PAC check of $300,000 during the meeting, while Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) has not disclosed whether he made a transfer. The NRSC raised more than $6.5 million at the lunch, with Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) citing a $10 million transfer by Vice President Kamala Harris to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee as the impetus. Daines said, 'If there's one thing that Kamala Harris can do well, maybe the only thing, it's raise money. So we've got a gap that we need to close.' Thune has raised $26 million this cycle, while Cornyn has raised $23 million through June. Cornyn has outlined his priorities, including extending the 2017 tax cuts and preserving the legislative filibuster, but the outcome of the November election will likely play a significant role in determining the next GOP leader.
