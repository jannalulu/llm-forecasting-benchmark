**New Elections Loom as Coalition Government Collapses**
The first polls after the collapse of the coalition government have been released, showing little change in party support, but a clear majority in favor of holding new elections sooner rather than later. According to an Infratest-Dimap poll for ARD, 65% of respondents want new elections as soon as possible, while only 33% prefer a later date in March. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced that he is willing to hold a confidence vote in parliament this year, which could lead to new elections in February. The current polls show the CDU/CSU leading with the most support, followed closely by the AfD, SPD, and Greens. The FDP and Left Party are struggling to gain traction. The polls are not predictions of the election outcome, but rather a snapshot of public opinion at the time of the survey.

**Framing the Future: Who Will Be Iceland's Next Prime Minister?**
Icelanders, we need to think about our next step! Who will be the next prime minister after the elections? Which individual and party is likely to lead a three-party coalition, rather than a four-party coalition? Let's examine the leading candidates of each party and ask ourselves who is most likely to succeed. I'm not sure, but Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson is likely to be at the forefront. He showed this in 2016 when Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson resigned, and everything fell into place quickly, allowing the people to assess Sigurður Ingi's work. With him, we can expect ministers who have earned a good reputation. Lilja Dögg Alfreðsdóttir, the party's deputy leader, has made significant contributions to culture and the arts. Lilja has been a spokesperson for the Icelandic language and has '...'

**Five Parties to Receive Seats in Northwestern Constituency**
According to a recent survey by Maskína, five parties in the Northwestern constituency will receive a seat in the Icelandic parliament. The survey, which was conducted in the first week of November, showed that the Independence Party and the Social Democratic Alliance are the largest parties in the constituency with 19% each. The Progressive Party comes in third with 17%, followed by the Reform Party with 11% and the Liberal Party with 10%. The Pirate Party and the People's Party received 6% each, the Socialist Party 5%, and the Left-Green Party 3%. The survey also shows that the support for these parties is relatively stable, with the Independence Party and the Social Democratic Alliance consistently being the largest parties. The Progressive Party's support is increasing, while the Reform Party's support is stable. The Liberal Party's support is also stable, but with a slight decrease. The Pirate Party, the Socialist Party, and the Left-Green Party are far from receiving a seat in the constituency. It is difficult to predict which parties will receive the equalizing seat.

**Bjarni Benediktsson Rules Out Participation in EU-Advocating Government**
Bjarni Benediktsson, chairman of the Independence Party, stated in a debate on Stöð 2 that he would not participate in a government that would advocate for Iceland's entry into the European Union. He said, 'I see no reason for entry into the EU.' Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, chairman of the Centre Party, asked Bjarni if he would consider giving something in exchange for the EU's entry, but Bjarni replied that he would not take part in a government that would fight for entry into the EU. This statement suggests that Bjarni is not opposed to taking part in a government that aligns with the Independence Party's stance on the EU.

**Left-Green Movement's Time with Independence Party is Over**
The deputy leader of the Left-Green Movement, Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson, stated, 'It was simply the decision of the party that our time with the Independence Party is over. And we will not take a seat in this government.' He claims that the party is not being obstinate, but rather that the Prime Minister and the Independence Party did not trust in continuing their cooperation. The Prime Minister had fallen the government without consulting the leaders of the other parties. The Left-Green Movement will not participate in the new government. Guðmundur Ingi believes that the party has always put the interests of the people first in their work. He also mentions that the party has a good story to tell from the current term, such as reforming the pension system and establishing the Human Rights Institution. The party will now focus on the upcoming elections.

**Left-Green Movement Refuses President's Request to Remain in Government**
Svandís Svavarsdóttir, the leader of the Left-Green Movement, has announced that the party's ministers will not accept the President of Iceland's request to remain in the government. The ministers, including Svandís herself, Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson, and Bjarkey Olsen Gunnarsdóttir, will resign as ministers and become ordinary MPs from tomorrow.

The President, Bjarni Benediktsson, had requested that the ministers remain in the government, but the Left-Green Movement has decided not to accept this request. The next step is the elections on November 30, where the party will discuss the future and vision for Iceland with voters. Svandís said, 'The call for change, due to inflation and growth, is clear in economic and housing matters, as well as in public services and other important areas. We in the Left-Green Movement believe that the only solution is strong solidarity, not other ways to address the real challenges of the time. In the spirit of social justice, feminism, peace, and green politics, we will hold a meeting with voters.' The Left-Green Movement's statement is clear, they will work to give the left a strong voice in the Icelandic parliament. I am excited! See you there!'

**Össur Skarphéðinsson: Sigurður Ingi will end his term as Prime Minister**
Össur Skarphéðinsson, former chairman of the Social Democratic Alliance, believes that Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson, chairman of the Progressive Party, will end his term as Prime Minister. Össur compares the current situation to the 2016 parliamentary proposal by Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, chairman of the Centre Party, and the current proposal by Bjarni Benediktsson, Prime Minister. Össur quotes Bjarni as saying that it would be best if the current government remained in power until the next elections, but if the coalition parties did not want that, he would submit a resignation to the President. Svandís Svavarsdóttir, chairman of the Left-Green Movement, said that it would be most important for Bjarni to submit a resignation and that she could imagine a caretaker government with Sigurður Ingi as Prime Minister. Össur says that according to his own statement, Bjarni was supposed to meet with the President to submit a resignation for his government. Össur believes that Sigurður Ingi will end his term as Prime Minister. 'So the story repeats itself. When men set up a play, they must think of the end. It did not happen in 2016, and it will not happen in 2024,' Össur says in the end.

**Iceland's Ruling Coalition Collapses, New Elections Proposed**
The ruling coalition in Iceland has collapsed since November 2021, composed of left-wing and right-wing parties due to political disagreements, as announced by Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson on Sunday, proposing new elections in November next month. The Prime Minister, leader of the conservative Independence Party, the largest in parliament, explained that different positions on various issues, from foreign policy to asylum seekers and energy policy, have fueled tensions within the coalition in recent months. He announced that he will meet with President Halldór Guðjónsson on Monday to propose dissolving parliament and calling for new legislative elections in November. The government coalition consisted of the Independence Party, the Left-Green Movement, and the Progress Party (center-right). Benediktsson took over as Prime Minister in April 2024 after the previous Prime Minister, Katrín Jakobsdóttir, resigned from the Left-Green Movement to run for the presidential election, which she lost.

**Guðmundur Ingi Not Considered for Prime Minister Position**
In the coalition negotiations between the Independence Party, the Progress Party, and the Left-Green Movement (VG) after Katrín Jakobsdóttir's presidential candidacy, it was never considered that Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson, the acting chairman of VG, would become the Prime Minister. This was revealed by Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs, in Spursmálum on Friday. The coalition negotiations ended with Bjarni Benediktsson, chairman of the Independence Party, taking the position of Prime Minister. Sigurður Ingi also considered taking the lead in the government. 'It was considered that I could have led the government, for example. We discussed it,' Sigurður Ingi said when asked. It was never considered that Guðmundur Ingi would take the position. 'No, it was not considered. Not to our knowledge,' Sigurður Ingi replied. Full responsibility to maintain the coalition is not being upheld. Guðmundur Ingi has decided not to run for chairman of the Left-Green Movement at the party's national conference next weekend. Svandís Svavarsdóttir, Minister of Innovation and Education, has announced her candidacy, and no one has announced a counter-candidacy. 'I would just say that everyone is eligible for four years and we said we would complete all the tasks we were not yet done. We actually achieved a very good result last year in parliament. However, there are still tasks we are working on and I would just say that it would be full responsibility if the government did not continue under the current circumstances,' Sigurður Ingi said.

**Svavarsdóttir wants to lead the Left-Green Movement**
Svandís Svavarsdóttir, Minister of Infrastructure, plans to run for the position of chairman of the Left-Green Movement. She confirmed this to a journalist after the cabinet meeting yesterday. Svavarsdóttir says that it was not easy to decide whether she should run for the chair of the Left-Green Movement, citing the need to consider both the political and personal sides. She wants to speed up the parliamentary elections so that they will be held this spring, not next fall as planned. Svavarsdóttir believes that it is possible to sharpen the strong voice that VG always intended to be, and 'hope that with my colleagues I can make our voice even stronger.' The government is expected to be discussed at the party's national meeting, and Svavarsdóttir assumes that government cooperation will be on the agenda. She says that it would be 'very strange' if they were not to discuss their cooperation in the government and elsewhere. 'When we are at the point where we want to look inward and want to look at the roots, this must be on the agenda and this is definitely one of the things we want to discuss,' she adds. Asked if it is an indicator of a split within the party, she says: 'I don't think so, I think it's just a normal part of the process.'
