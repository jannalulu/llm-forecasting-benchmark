**ABC Not Losing Subscribers Due to Elon Musk's Alleged Boycott Call**
A false news story has been circulating that ABC lost a million subscribers due to an appeal to boycott launched by Elon Musk. However, this information is unfounded and originated from a satirical Facebook page. The page, SpaceX Fanclub, is known for its satirical content and posted the false narrative on September 17, 2024. The story was spread through various articles and social media platforms, but there is no evidence that Elon Musk ever asked the public to boycott ABC. As stated on the original Facebook post, 'Pubblichiamo SATIRA, niente su questa pagina Ã¨ reale' (We publish SATIRE, nothing on this page is real) and 'SATIRA VALUTATA' (SATIRICAL CONTENT) are clearly indicated. Politifact also confirmed that there is no evidence of Elon Musk asking for a boycott of ABC. 'It's a classic case of misinformation,' said no one, as the story was spread through disinformation websites and social media pages.

**Elon Musk Considers Starship Landing a Success, Despite Mechazilla Failure**
Elon Musk considers the landing of Starship a 'success' and says they will try to catch the ship with Mechazilla soon. During the sixth test flight of the Starship system on November 19, SpaceX achieved several technical milestones, including a maneuver, the ignition of one of six Raptor engines, and controlled atmospheric re-entry. However, the Super Heavy rocket landed in the Gulf of Mexico instead of being caught by Mechazilla. Musk believes that 'the capture would have worked anyway' despite the decision to abort the capture due to a loss of communication with the launch tower computer. This statement raises questions about the decision made by SpaceX, as the engineers stated that they did not meet the 'compromise criterion' because many factors were not working correctly. Musk adds that they 'opted for caution' because they were not sure. SpaceX aims to make its rockets completely reusable thanks to Mechazilla's mechanics, but how does it work? The tower is equipped with two mechanical arms that act as a capture system. After launching a rocket, Mechazilla remains in standby while the rocket completes its mission, and then the arms adjust to the spacecraft's trajectory and proceed to catch it using their motors and flaps. This system is crucial for reducing the costs of space missions, avoiding ocean landings, facilitating the transportation of large loads, saving time, and reducing the wear and tear on the rocket's stages.

**SpaceX's Starship Completes Sixth Test Flight, Despite Aborted Maneuver**
Elon Musk's SpaceX Starship has completed its sixth test flight, reaching an altitude of nearly 200 kilometers and speeds of over 25,000 km/h. The second stage of the rocket landed successfully in the Indian Ocean after a planned and controlled descent. During the test flight, a prominent guest was present - former US President Donald Trump, accompanied by his 17-year-old granddaughter Kai Trump. Kai Trump shared exclusive behind-the-scenes photos and videos of the SpaceX launch on her blog. The test flight was initially planned to include a spectacular maneuver where mechanical arms would catch the rocket's engine in mid-air, but the mission was aborted after four minutes due to concerns about the launch tower. Musk explained to Trump, 'We had some concerns about the tower, so we decided to land it in the sea.' Trump replied, 'That's amazing.' He then asked, 'Can we use it again? Can we retrieve it from the sea?' Musk hesitated and replied, 'Ah, it will... it will... it will probably explode. That's my guess.' The interaction between Musk and Trump was described as 'cringe-worthy' by The Daily Beast. Despite the setback, SpaceX announced plans to conduct another ocean landing of the Starship and attempt to catch it with the launch tower. The company highlighted the success of the test flight, which exceeded the rocket's original stress limit and successfully restarted one of its engines, a crucial step for future missions to the Moon or Mars.

**SpaceX has set a Jan. 11 launch date for Starship, NASA email to FAA shows**
According to an email sent by NASA to the Federal Aviation Administration, SpaceX is planning to launch its next Starship megarocket from South Texas on January 11, 2025. NASA will use its Gulfstream V jet, NASA5, to monitor the flight with specialized sensors to study the effects of reentry heating on the spacecraft. The email, which was posted on an FAA regulatory website, outlines plans for NASA flight crews to deploy to Perth, Australia, in early January to support the launch event. The Gulfstream V will need to calibrate its instruments in the skies over Texas before the mission, and NASA is requesting an exemption to aircraft lighting requirements to allow for this calibration. As stated by Brett Pugsley, a branch chief in NASA's Air Operations Division, 'The data collected is essential in understanding space vehicle performance, formulating design improvement, and ultimately making future reusable space vehicles safer for humanity's ongoing quest to explore the cosmos and advance scientific discovery.'

**SpaceX Starship Seventh Flight Test Scheduled for January 11, 2025**
According to NASA's latest files, SpaceX's seventh Starship flight test is scheduled for January 11, 2025. Following the sixth flight, SpaceX founder Elon Musk stated that the next mission will continue to attempt sea landing, and if successful, the company will attempt to use the launch tower to catch the spacecraft. From a long-term perspective, SpaceX aims to make the launch tower capture technology a standard operation to achieve rapid reuse of two-stage rockets. This strategy not only showcases SpaceX's technological innovation but also plays a crucial role in promoting space commercialization. Musk also revealed that SpaceX plans to launch 25 Starships in 2025 and aims to increase the number of annual launches to an astonishing 100 in the following years. Additionally, SpaceX is expected to launch multiple unmanned Starships to Mars within two years. If these unmanned missions are successful, humans may witness the launch of manned spacecraft to Mars in the near future. Furthermore, SpaceX is aggressively pushing forward with production line construction at Starfactory. Once the production line is fully mature, SpaceX will be able to produce a new second-stage body every eight hours. Moreover, the new-generation rockets, Starship 2 and Starship 3, will have the capability to carry over 100 tons and 200 tons of payload into orbit, respectively, which will be a significant milestone for establishing self-sufficient cities on Mars.

**FAA updates environmental review for increased Starship launches**
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has released an updated environmental review for SpaceX's Starship vehicle, which could lead to an increase in the number of annual launches from its Texas test site. The review examined the impacts of up to 25 launches and 25 landings per year, and while it did not provide a formal recommendation, it did not identify any significant environmental issues that would prevent the increase. The FAA will hold public meetings to gather input on the proposal, which will run through January 17. SpaceX has been allowed to perform up to five launches a year under an earlier environmental review, and has already performed the fourth such launch this year. However, the company had to abort a planned 'catch' landing of the Super Heavy booster due to a communications issue with the launch tower, according to Elon Musk. 'Lost comms to the launch tower computer,' Musk posted on X. 'Catch would probably still have worked, but we werenât sure, so erred on the side of caution.'

**SpaceX Receives FAA Approval for 25 Starship Launches in 2025**
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has released a draft environmental assessment (EA) that proposes increasing SpaceX's annual launch operations for Starship from five to 25 by 2025. The assessment, published on November 20, suggests that the current limit of five annual launches from Starbase in southern Texas could be raised to 25 by 2025. The draft also includes approvals for 25 landings of the Super Heavy booster for the Starship spacecraft and the upper stage at the same site, using the 'catching food tines' mechanism in the launch tower. According to a report by Space, SpaceX may receive FAA approval to launch 25 Starship spacecraft in 2025. The Starship spacecraft, which is recognized as the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, is central to SpaceX's vision for human exploration of the moon and Mars. The spacecraft is 400 feet tall and is designed for complete reusability, and has been launched six times so far, all from the Starbase facility. During its recent mission on November 19, 2024, the mission was successful, although a communication failure forced the booster to make a controlled landing in the Gulf of Mexico instead of returning to the launch tower. The FAA's draft assessment, which defines these expanded operational capabilities, is still in its initial stage. Public consultations will take place in January, with four in-person meetings in southern Texas on January 7 and 9, as well as a virtual session on January 13. Reactions from these discussions will form the final environmental assessment.

**SpaceX fails to repeat Starship booster catch, as Trump watches on**
SpaceX's latest test flight of its Starship megarocket was unsuccessful in catching the descending first stage, despite President-elect Donald Trump's presence at the event. The Super Heavy booster made a more subdued splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, with company representatives citing unmet technical criteria. This failure comes after a previous successful demonstration of the 'chopstick' arms, which Trump personally lauded during his election victory speech. SpaceX founder Elon Musk has been a constant presence at Trump's side since his election victory, raising questions over possible conflicts of interests given SpaceX's lucrative contracts with NASA and the Pentagon. Musk aims to launch the first uncrewed missions to Mars as early as 2026, coinciding with the next 'Mars transfer window'.

**SpaceX Explains Why Starship's First Stage Was Intentionally Crashed**
SpaceX explained why the Starship rocket's first stage was intentionally crashed into the ocean during its last test flight, rather than being caught by the launch pad's recovery mechanism. According to Elon Musk, the head of SpaceX, a malfunction occurred on the ground infrastructure, not on the rocket itself, during the November 20, 2024 launch. The launch pad's tower lost contact with the mission control center shortly after the Starship spacecraft separated from the Super Heavy first stage, as Musk wrote on X. As a result, the command was given to steer the first stage towards the Gulf of Mexico for a controlled splashdown. It's possible that the stage could have been caught by the tower in autonomous mode, but SpaceX decided not to take the risk. The recovery of the first stage of Super Heavy has already been successful, during the fifth test flight. However, the attempt was almost a failure, but it was successful in the end. The incident led to a software update for the first stage's equipment, which was intended to be tested during the sixth test flight. However, the ground infrastructure failed this time. The sixth test flight was still successful in its mission, providing valuable data on the dynamics of the Starship spacecraft's descent at subsonic speeds during the final stage of the flight before splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This data will help later to organize the capture of the Starship spacecraft by the launch pad's tower. However, at least one more test flight, the seventh, will take place before that. In this flight, the spacecraft will be larger and have a slightly different layout of the flaps. If the new version of the spacecraft shows a successful splashdown on the same side of the Earth as all previous flights, SpaceX may attempt to recover the Starship spacecraft and catch it in the air during the eighth flight, which is expected to take place in early 2025.

**Starship's Sixth Flight Test: A Step Towards Reusability**
SpaceX's sixth Starship flight test was successfully completed on November 20, 2024. The test aimed to repeat the 'chopstick-grabbing-rocket' maneuver, but it was not successful. However, the Starship did successfully relight its Raptor engines in space, a feat that was first attempted in March but failed due to high roll rates. The test also carried a banana as a payload, which was a nod to the internet meme 'banana scale'. The Starship is expected to undergo a major upgrade for its seventh flight test, which will include a new propulsion system, improved heat shields, and a redesigned nose fairing. SpaceX aims to conduct 25 Starship launches in 2025, a goal that some consider overly ambitious. However, with the potential for relaxed regulatory environment under the new US administration, SpaceX may be able to achieve this goal.

**Elon Musk's SpaceX fails to repeat Starship booster catch, as Trump watches on**
SpaceX's Starship megarocket launched on Tuesday, but failed to repeat its previous 'chopstick' catch, instead splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico. The launch, attended by former President Donald Trump, marked a quick turnaround for the rocket and a deepening relationship between Musk and Trump, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. SpaceX's founder and CEO, Elon Musk, has been a constant presence at Trump's side since his election victory, and has been tapped to co-lead a new 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE). The flight was seen as a test of whether SpaceX's first booster catch was pure precision or relied on luck, and included key milestones such as reigniting Starship's Raptor engines for the first time in space and trialing new heat shield materials. Musk aims to launch the first uncrewed missions to Mars as early as 2026, and has already teased that its successor, Starship V3, will be '3X more powerful' and could take flight in about a year.

**SpaceX's Starship Fails to Capture First Stage, But Makes Progress in Reusability**
SpaceX conducted the sixth integrated flight of the Starship vehicle on Tuesday (19th), but was unable to repeat the capture of the first stage with the robotic arm. The largest rocket in history took off at 19h (BrasÃ­lia time) from Starbase, the company's installation in Boca Chica, Texas, USA. The first stage, the Super Heavy propellant, separated from the second, the Starship spacecraft, about three minutes after launch and then began maneuvers to return to the platform. However, unlike last month, telemetry data sent by the first stage led the company to decide not to bring the Super Heavy to the mechazilla, a structure developed to catch the propellant in the air. Instead, the rocket descended, as planned in case of contingency, in a controlled manner into the ocean. The second stage continued its suborbital trajectory, passing about an hour in space and making more than half a turn around the Earth, in an effort to push the envelope and establish higher limits for its operations. The spacecraft activated one of its Raptor engines in space, a first for the program. The landing, which was successful, was recorded by cameras on board and in nearby buoys, producing beautiful live images transmitted by SpaceX on its X social network account. This was the last flight with the original Starship model, which has undergone hundreds of mission improvements mission by mission. From the seventh flight, the updates will be more notable, including redesigned front flaps, larger propellant tanks, the new generation of thermal protection tiles, and secondary thermal protection layers. The goal is to develop a fully reusable thermal protection system that will enable rapid recovery and preparation of the Starship for new flights. The program still needs to demonstrate several technologies before the rocket can be used for human transportation to the lunar surface, as the NASA wants for the Artemis 3 mission, scheduled for the end of 2026 (with possible delay to 2027 or 2028).

SpaceX has planned its sixth Starship test flight for November 18 at 16:00 local time, aiming for a daytime landing in the Indian Ocean to improve visual analysis of the descent and landing process. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has granted SpaceX simultaneous permits for the fifth and sixth test flights, possibly in response to recent regulatory disputes between the agency and the space company. The sixth mission will include a soft landing of the first stage of the heavy-lift rocket using SpaceX's Starship servicing tower. A new feature of this flight will be the attempt to restart one of the Starship's engines in a vacuum and adjust the angle of descent for testing the heat shields. These adjustments will allow for the evaluation and refinement of Starship's entry into the atmosphere scenarios. The spacecraft will also feature a modernized heat shield and reserve systems, while the heavy-lift rocket has received an updated software patch to address a programming glitch that nearly led to a failure during the previous test. If the rocket's landing is successful, SpaceX will move on to the seventh launch with an even more advanced Starship configuration, including an improved heat shield, larger fuel tanks, and redesigned aerodynamic flaps. The November test will play a crucial role in completing the Starship design, paving the way for a fully modernized system.

**Space Forceâs effort to bring in new launch providers hasnât worked yet. Officials arenât surprised.**
The Space Force's effort to bring in new launch providers has not yet yielded results, with SpaceX winning the first contract in the National Space Security Launch Phase 3 program. Officials, including Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, program executive officer for Assured Access to Space, are not surprised by this outcome. Panzenhagen said, 'I don't look at it as a failure at all. We fully anticipated it. I mean, everybody knows who's launching right now. We knew it was going to be a very limited set, but we knew we had to start somewhere.' The service is looking to bring in new companies, such as Relativity Space, Firefly Aerospace, Rocket Lab, and ABL Space Systems, but it's unclear when they will be ready to compete for Lane 1 launches. The Pentagon has picked SpaceX, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance to compete for $5.6 billion worth of contracts in Lane 1, which includes at least 30 missions from fiscal 2025 to 2029.

**Samsung Galaxy Users Will Have to Wait Until 2025 for Android 15 Update**
Android 15 has been available since October 15, 2024, but Samsung Galaxy users will have to wait until 2025 to receive the update. The update, which includes features such as protection against theft, private space, and app archiving, will be implemented through One UI 7, but it has been delayed. According to Samsung, the update will be available for approximately 50 Samsung phones, but the exact date is still unknown. However, it is expected to coincide with the launch of the new Samsung Galaxy S25 series, which is expected to be released in January 2025. The delay is due to the postponement of One UI 7's beta release, which was initially scheduled for August 2024. Samsung has confirmed that One UI 7 will not be available before January 2025. Despite the delay, Samsung's long-term support for updates, which can last up to six years, may be a consolation for users.

**Light Start: The return of Starship, Eskom gets a grip, Tomb Raiderâs HD drip, and Internet Archive makes a flip**
SpaceX successfully caught the Starship booster on its fifth attempt, a feat that has never been achieved before. The booster, which is 71 meters tall and has 33 Raptor engines, was able to return to Earth and was caught by Mechazilla, the launch platform. This is a significant breakthrough for SpaceX, as it has always been a challenge to catch a rocket of this size. Meanwhile, Eskom has achieved a milestone of 200 consecutive days of uninterrupted power supply, a result of its 'Generation Operational Recovery Plan'. The utility is on track to reach 206 days without load shedding by October 18, 2024. Additionally, Crystal Dynamics is releasing a remastered version of Tomb Raider IV to VI, featuring updated visuals and new features such as photo mode and boss health bars. The Internet Archive has recovered from a cyberattack and is back online in a provisional, read-only manner, but new pages cannot be captured and added to the catalogue until further maintenance is completed.

**At Long Last, Europe Has an Answer to SpaceX (or Does It?)**
Arianespace, a subsidiary of ArianeGroup, is finally announcing a reusable rocket design, dubbed by its new subsidiary MaiaSpace, after years of failed attempts. The new rocket, details of which are scarce, is expected to be smaller than SpaceX's Falcon 9, with a payload capacity of 1.5 tons. It will be designed to launch from land and land on a barge at sea. MaiaSpace's CEO, Yohann Leroy, claims to have 10 potential clients interested in launching on the new rocket, with a goal of having it ready for a first launch by 2025. However, given Arianespace's spotty record of announcing reusable rocket plans only to cancel them later, investors should be cautious and wait for more details before investing. As the article's author notes, 'the future for this rocket looks even hazier to me than did those for previous reusable rocket designs.'

**SpaceX will try to 'catch' giant Starship rocket shortly before landing**
SpaceX is set to attempt a world first on its next test flight of the Starship megarocket: catching the returning first-stage booster using the launch tower's 'chopstick' arms. The launch window opens at 7:00 am (1200 GMT) from the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas. If successful, the returning booster will decelerate from supersonic speeds, generating audible sonic booms around the landing site, and the powerful 'chopstick arms' will embrace it as it descends about seven minutes after launch. SpaceX's 'fail fast, learn fast' strategy has accelerated development and contributed to the company's success, but its founding vision of making humanity a multiplanetary species is increasingly at risk of being overshadowed by Elon Musk's alignment with right-wing politics.

**US FAA grounds SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket after second-stage malfunction**
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has grounded SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket after it malfunctioned during a NASA astronaut mission on Saturday. The rocket's second stage failed to properly re-light its engine for its 'deorbit burn,' causing it to fall outside of the designated safety zone in the Pacific Ocean. The astronaut crew safely docked at the International Space Station on Sunday. SpaceX said the malfunction was 'off-nominal' and that they will resume launching after a thorough investigation. This is the third time in three months that the FAA has grounded the Falcon 9 rocket, citing concerns over public safety. SpaceX has launched an average of two to three rockets a week since the beginning of 2024, but the FAA has been slow to approve new launch licenses, leading to a feud between the two. 'We will resume launching after we better understand root cause,' SpaceX wrote in a post on X.
