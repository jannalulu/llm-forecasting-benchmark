**Protests Erupt Across US After Trump's Presidential Election Victory**
Protests and clashes broke out in several US states after Donald Trump's presidential election victory. Activists from the Antifa movement clashed with Portland police in Oregon, while a large crowd of protesters gathered in Chicago, Illinois, chanting slogans like 'Not my president' and 'Free Palestine.' The Chicago Police Department requested additional units to control the crowd and maintain order. Similar protests were held in Philadelphia and New York, with many Americans taking to social media to express their opposition to Trump's win and support for women's reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and gun control laws. According to Portland Police Chief Bob Day, officers are conducting patrols in the area to prevent any further disturbances. He noted that while the situation may seem clear now, the election season is not yet over, with the presidential inauguration scheduled for January 6, 2025.

**US Election 2024: The 'Civil War' Fears Were Not Hysteria**
The US authorities had prepared for all possible attacks on the integrity of the electoral system, including extreme violence. Was this just hype? The counting center in Phoenix, Arizona, was a major concern, with a thick metal fence, sharpshooters, and drones securing the area. However, on election night, there were no major incidents or manipulation allegations reported in Arizona or elsewhere. Trump's camp had been particularly aggressive in challenging the 2020 results, and this time they were prepared for all possible objections and threats. Trump had claimed weeks before the election that the vote would be 'stolen', and Republicans filed dozens of lawsuits against alleged irregularities. However, most of these would have likely failed, like in 2020. Trump and his supporters were not trying to win in court, but to discredit the democratic process, sow doubt, and incite anger and violence. Some states also took the opportunity to address real weaknesses in the electoral system, modernizing and speeding up the counting process. As Süddeutsche Zeitung notes, preparing for potential attacks and minimizing the attack surface was a reasonable strategy. 'It was not hysteria, but a justified fear,' said the article, referencing the real-life attacks on election officials in 2020 and the January 6th Capitol storming. 'The fear of riots or even a civil war after a Trump defeat was as real as the physical attacks on election workers four years ago.'

**Protests Are Inevitable After the Election**
Security measures are in place around major cities, including the White House, as authorities anticipate potential protests and riots following the election. Mike Gonzalez, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, warns that the rising tide of Next Gen Marxism could lead to chaos, regardless of the election outcome. Gonzalez notes that the groundwork for civil disorder has already been laid, and that the situation is not just about a few angry protesters, but a larger trend fueled by a radical ideology that seeks to undermine institutions and promote unrest. As Washington's police chief says 'there's no need for any alarm', many are left wondering if authorities are truly prepared for the potential consequences.

**CIA Advisor Warns of '2025 Civil War': 'This is the Beginning'**
A CIA advisor has warned that 'this is the beginning of the 2025 civil war.' According to the Guardian, the US is heading towards an explosive situation. Stephen Marche, author of The Next Civil War, claims that the country is entering a phase of unprecedented political danger. Ray Dalio, a renowned investor, shares this view, describing society as 'on the brink of collapse.' A survey reveals that an increasing number of Americans are anticipating the possibility of an imminent civil war. Jim Rickards, a former CIA advisor, Pentagon, and White House advisor, adds weight to this prophecy. After correctly predicting the 2008 Great Recession, Trump's 2016 election, and the COVID crisis, he is now alarmed by the explosive climate of the 2025 election. Even if Trump wins against Kamala Harris, Congress could use legal maneuvers to prevent him from accessing power. This refusal of peaceful transition would trigger a devastating chain reaction, leading to a market crash, a dollar collapse, and a surge in social tensions. Rickards now exposes the sinister plan of Democrats to keep Trump out of the White House even if he wins the election. Imagine January 6, 2025: Trump wins, but he is prevented from taking office. With all the political uncertainty, the stock market is plummeting, with some stocks crashing by up to 50%. Countries around the world are getting rid of the US dollar like never before... Triggering a historic crash that annihilates the purchasing power of millions of Americans. Political and economic discontent leads to massive riots in the streets... American division has finally reached a breaking point. Thug units begin to organize to support their candidates... If you think this sounds like a crazy conspiracy theory... You should know that a popular member of Congress also predicts a possible civil war in January 2025. Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin publicly admitted that Democrats will try to prevent Trump from taking power... When he said: 'It will be us, on January 6, 2025, announcing to the Trump mobs that he is disqualified, and we will then need bodyguards for everyone in a civil war situation.' The stakes couldn't be higher... And all hell breaks loose. Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, in a statement without ambiguity, said that strict measures could be considered to counter a Trump victory, and that guards would be needed to protect elected officials from potential insurrection. Rickards urges Americans to prepare, insisting on five essential steps to protect their families in this troubled period. As a former lawyer and economist, he has worked at the highest levels of Wall Street and government, including in geopolitical crisis situations.

**Washington D.C. Prepares for Possible Riots Ahead of US Elections and Inauguration**
The authorities in Washington D.C. are preparing for possible riots and unrest ahead of the US elections and the inauguration of the new president in January. The city is expecting large crowds and has taken extensive security measures to prevent any violence. According to Chris Rodriguez, the deputy mayor of Washington, the security measures will be in place from the election day until January 6th and on the day of the inauguration. Pamela Smith, the police chief of Washington, stated that the Metropolitan Police Department and all authorities in D.C. are planning for these events and will not tolerate any violence or destruction of property. She emphasized that they will support the peaceful exercise of constitutional rights, but will take action against those who engage in violence or destruction. 'We will not tolerate any violence,' Smith said. 'Trespassers will be arrested and held accountable.'

**Could a Trump loss in US Election 2024 trigger civil unrest?**
As the 2024 US presidential election approaches, concerns are growing about potential civil unrest if Donald Trump loses. Experts warn of a polarized country bracing for post-election upheaval, with Trump's refusal to accept defeat and claims of electoral fraud being major factors. A recent poll found that nearly two-thirds of Americans think there will be violence after the election, and over a quarter believe a civil war could break out. The situation has inspired some to call for military intervention to quell potential unrest. A declassified report suggests that foreign actors can boost and mobilize incitements for violent demonstrations, making the situation even worse. Security has been increased in Washington, D.C. to prevent a repeat of the 2021 riot, but analysts remain wary. The 2024 election stakes transcend policy debates and partisan politics, speaking to the very essence of America's democratic norms. 'He'll stop at nothing to overturn the election,' says Binghamton University political analyst Donald Nieman. 'If I lose, I'll tell you what, it's possible because they cheat,' Trump said at a rally in Michigan last month. 'That's the only way we're going to lose — because they cheat.'

**DPS conducting riot training ahead of Election Day in case of civil unrest**
The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) is conducting riot training in preparation for potential civil unrest on Election Day. According to Sgt. Bryan Washko, 'We don't know what will happen, no matter who wins, there's going to be opposition and we hope they are peaceful, but if not we're prepared.' The DPS uses a Civil Disturbance Management Team (CDMT) and 13 Clydesdales to separate protesters from the crowd and make arrests if necessary. Sgt. Washko stated, 'It is an effective tool. It's intimidating to stand by a two thousand-pound horse.' The DPS has been using the horses since 2015 and is looking to buy more to keep up with the state's growing population. They are preparing for not just Election Day, but also the months leading up to January and the inauguration.

**No Real Risk of Civil War in the United States, Says Expert**
The possibility of a civil war in the United States is a concern, especially after the January 2021 storming of the Capitol. However, according to Jean-Éric Branaa, a professor at the University of Paris II-Assas, there is no real risk of a civil war. 'I've seen people buying ammunition and food in preparation for a possible civil war. I was shocked, so I also bought some, but it's hard to find,' said one American. Another person stated, 'It's going to be ugly. Really ugly. Look at all the riots that happened last time, the buildings burned... this time it will be worse. But if someone is looking for me, I have a family to protect.' Branaa believes that the situation is not as dire as it seems, 'The America has gone through difficult times before or after elections, and even at other moments. Political violence is at its peak, as we've seen with several attempts on Donald Trump's life. I understand that there is anxiety among some people, but it's based on a reality.' He also notes that there are very few 'go-to-war' pro-Trump individuals, 'You'll find them on extreme right groups like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. In reality, they are very limited. More than 900 people belonging to these neo-fascist groups have been condemned by the American justice system following the Capitol attack.' Branaa also tempers the situation, 'Donald Trump may contest the election results if he loses, but the situation is not the same as it was four years ago. He's no longer the president, he's no longer the figurehead that people can rely on. He's now in opposition, he's just a regular citizen.'

**Risks of Violence around the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election: A Primer**
The 2024 U.S. presidential election is approaching, with Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, facing off against Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate. The election is expected to be extremely close, with polls suggesting that a small number of votes in a handful of 'battleground states' could decide the outcome. Trump's actions during the 2020 campaign, including encouraging a mob to attack the Capitol on January 6, 2021, have raised concerns about his potential to foment election-related violence. Despite facing federal charges related to the Capitol riot, Trump remains unapologetic, describing January 6 as a 'day of love' and refusing to commit to peacefully concede if Harris wins. President Biden has warned that Trump could again encourage election-related violence, and while some mitigating factors are in place, such as the prosecution of Capitol rioters and legislative reforms, the risk of subversion remains. Trump's lack of incumbency status means he cannot command state powers or use the bully pulpit to foment unrest, but he may still attempt to encourage supporters to sow chaos around vote counting and certification processes.

**US Presidential Election: Will it be Calm or Chaos?**
The 2024 US presidential election is generating as much suspense about the outcome as it is about the aftermath. Will we see a major judicial battle, violent protests in the streets, or a country refusing to tear itself apart further? The answer depends on the ability of the candidates to accept their potential defeat, which is likely to be a close call. However, it's Donald Trump who is causing the most concern. The 78-year-old Republican continues to claim that the only way he could lose is if his opponent, Democrat Kamala Harris, rigs the election results. He has refused to say that he would support a peaceful transfer of power and continues to claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him, a central element of the federal charges against him for his alleged attempt to overturn the result. 'If he loses, I'm sure he'll cry foul, try to overturn the results, and refuse to attend Harris's inauguration,' predicts Donald Nieman, a politics professor at Binghamton University in New York. Harris, on the other hand, is expected to accept defeat, with 95% of her supporters believing she will do so, but only 48% of Trump's supporters think so, according to a Pew Research Center poll. Two-thirds of Americans fear a violent eruption after the election, according to an Ipsos poll. The two candidates are accusing each other of fueling tensions. Harris has called Trump a 'fascist,' while Trump has directly linked the attempts on his life to Harris's rhetoric, which he says has created a 'bloodbath' in the US. In Washington, authorities have been preparing for the sensitive period from election day to January 20, 2025, when the new president will be inaugurated. Metal barriers are already being erected near the White House, and more will surround the Capitol building. The Capitol Police, where Congress is located, has increased its staff to 2,100 officers, about 300 more than on January 6, 2021, when hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the building. The critical day of January 6, 2025, when the election results will be certified, will have the same level of security as the inauguration ceremony. The hundreds of severe convictions handed down to the January 6 rioters may have a deterrent effect. The 2020 election was held on November 3, but the result was not known until November 7. Trump declared himself the winner on election night and immediately began denouncing supposed irregularities, trying to rally his vice president and attorney general to his cause, but in vain. If the Republican candidate were to cry victory prematurely again, 'we have the resources and expertise' to respond, Harris said on Tuesday. And this time, the former president will not be in charge of the federal administration and will not be able to use the courts or the military to exert pressure. In 2020, he filed lawsuits all over the place, but got no favorable judgments, with the judges telling him he should have acted earlier. But the Republicans have learned from this judicial fiasco. They have recruited an army of 100,000 volunteers and thousands of lawyers to monitor the integrity of the election and have filed over 130 lawsuits in at least 26 states. The Democrats have retaliated with around 35 lawsuits, making the 2024 election known as 'the litigation election.' Finally, note that electoral disputes are ultimately resolved by the US Supreme Court, which has been solidly conservative since Trump appointed three justices.

**DC warns of potential for violence and election uncertainty ahead of Jan. 6**
Federal and local law enforcement in Washington, D.C. are preparing for a potential transfer of power on Jan. 6, 2025, and Inauguration Day. D.C. Assistant City Administrator Chris Rodrigez warned that there may be 'pervasive misinformation and disinformation about the outcome of the election,' and officials are planning for any and all threats, including violence and civil unrest. Approximately 140 police officers were injured during the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection, and officials have learned to have 'better coordination among the federal branches' to prevent similar incidents. Close to 4,000 additional law enforcement officers will be deployed to D.C. between Jan. 6 and Inauguration Day, and the mayor is considering an advance request for National Guard support. Rodrigez urged residents to report any suspicious activity, saying 'If you see something, say something.' The city is anticipating robust fencing around the Capitol from Jan. 6 until Jan. 21, and officials are prepared for a 'fluid, unpredictable security environment' that includes extremist groups and potential civil unrest.

Local officials and community leaders are concerned about the impact of post-election demonstrations on the city, with some residents already considering evacuation plans. The city's mayor, Muriel E. Bowser, has requested that the election certification on Jan. 6, 2025, be given the same high level of security as an inauguration. 'We are about to enter a period that is going to be extremely chaotic,' said Keya Chatterjee, a former advisory neighborhood commissioner. 'This is an all-hands-on-deck effort for the city,' said Assistant City Administrator Chris Rodriguez. 'We are prepared. We are making sure that we are fulfilling our role as the federal city to ensure a peaceful transition of power.'

**Can military forces be used to quash an 'enemy within,' like Trump suggested? Here's what to know**
Former President Donald Trump suggested using the military to quash 'chaos' on U.S. soil, specifically citing the 'enemy within,' referring to the 'radical left-lunatics.' However, only the president of the United States has control over the military, and President Joe Biden remains the commander-in-chief until January 20, 2025. The National Guard serves both state and federal functions but is largely under the control of state governors. The Insurrection Act, dating back to 1792, outlines three scenarios for authorizing force in cases of civil unrest. The law is meant to be an exception to the principle that the military should not be involved in civilian affairs. Trump has previously suggested using the Insurrection Act to tamp down protests and riots, but was met with pushback from his own administration.

**Risk of US civil unrest highest level since BLM – Verisk Maplecroft**
According to Verisk Maplecroft's Strikes Riots and Civil Commotion (SRCC) predictive model, the risk of civil unrest in the US is at its highest level since the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. The model forecasts a 12-month risk of damaging civil unrest in 198 countries, with the US ranked as the fifth highest risk country in the world. Verisk Maplecroft warned that the US is on a par with the conditions just before the BLM protests, which cost approximately $3bn in insured losses. Public opinion polls suggest that political polarisation has continued to rise in the country, with around three-quarters of supporters of Democratic contender Kamala Harris and four-fifths of Trump supporters profoundly disagreeing with the other side's core values. The report noted that elections are not necessarily good predictors of civil unrest, but the volatile political landscape in the US provides an environment that could spark violent protests and riots. Data from the SRCC predictive model showed that 755 counties are placed in its 'very high or high-risk' categories, with New York topping the list of the 10 highest risk counties. Verisk Maplecroft warned that the potential for local events to turn nationwide is significant, particularly in the event of violence at polling stations or a contested election outcome.

According to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, 'The President and I, and many others, are talking about what we saw on January 6, 2021. It's clear that we've always been concerned.' The concern stems from the January 6, 2021, riots that followed Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 presidential election. Despite this, former US-Russia presidential commission advisor James Carden believes that the November presidential elections will not lead to large-scale unrest in the US, but described them as 'depressingly familiar' as they will be the third presidential election in a row.

**US Increases Security Measures to Prevent Repeat of 2021 Capitol Riot**
The US Secret Service has announced that security measures will be increased to prevent the repetition of the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which was a focal point of discussions about the direction of American democracy. According to a report in The Washington Post, the US Congress will convene on January 6, 2025, to certify the results of the presidential election on November 5. Eric Ranaghan, an agent responsible for the US Secret Service's Protective Division, stated that security will be increased on January 6, 2025, to prevent the repetition of the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The head of the police force responsible for protecting the US Capitol, J. Thomas Manger, stated that he is working in coordination with the National Guard to determine how to respond to any potential threats. Manger noted that there are 2,200 law enforcement personnel stationed at the Capitol, 250 more than there were four years ago. He emphasized that plans are in place to mobilize thousands of police officers if needed, saying, 'We're better equipped and better trained than we were in 2021. We have a better operation plan.' To prevent bureaucratic delays, Manger has requested that the National Guard be able to respond more quickly. Other measures being taken to counter potential threats include fencing around the Capitol, the deployment of the National Guard, and the assignment of additional police officers to work in the capital. In January 2021, far-right groups and supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building, where a joint session of Congress was being held to certify the results of the presidential election. Five people, including one police officer, were killed in the violence. Trump was later acquitted in the Senate on a charge of inciting a riot.

The Department of Homeland Security has designated January 6, 2025, as a 'national special security event' due to the 2021 Capitol riot. This is the first time such a designation has been made for the certification of the presidential vote. The decision was made in response to a request from Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who cited the need for increased security following the January 6, 2021, riot. The U.S. Secret Service will assume the lead role in developing and implementing the security plan, which will involve coordination with federal, state, and local agencies. As noted by Eric Ranaghan of the U.S. Secret Service, 'National Special Security Events are events of the highest national significance,' and the agency is committed to ensuring the safety and security of the event and its participants.

The Department of Homeland Security has designated January 6, 2025, as a 'national special security event' due to the 2021 Capitol riot. This is the first time such a designation has been made for the certification of the presidential vote. The decision was made in response to a request from Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and follows recommendations from the House Select January 6 Committee and the Government Accountability Office. The U.S. Secret Service will lead the security plan, utilizing significant resources from federal, state, and local partners to prevent another attack on democracy. As Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'Donald Trump left us the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.' The additional security measures aim to eliminate any risks or security breaches and ensure the safety and security of the event and its participants, as Eric Ranaghan of the U.S. Secret Service noted, 'National Special Security Events are events of the highest national significance.'
