**Biden Administration's Last-Ditch Effort to Undermine Trump**
The Biden administration is using its remaining time in office to undermine the incoming Trump administration. The latest move is to provide Ukraine with the right to use ATACMS missiles to strike deep into Russia. This is seen as a challenge to Trump's plans for peace talks with Russia, which are expected to begin soon. The Biden administration is also planning to transfer $7 billion to Ukraine as soon as possible. While Trump has not yet been formally inaugurated, the Biden administration is using its remaining powers to cause problems for the incoming administration. This includes appointing new ambassadors, judges, and other officials, as well as issuing presidential decrees and pardons. The Biden administration is also using the media to discredit Trump's nominees and policies. The article notes that the Biden administration's actions are a violation of the tradition of a smooth transition of power, and that they are using their remaining time in office to cause problems for the incoming administration. The article also notes that the Trump administration may face challenges in implementing its policies, including the possibility of a delay in the transfer of power on January 20.

**Catholics urge US President Biden to commute federal death row - Vatican News**
The Catholic Mobilizing Network (CMN) is urging US President Joe Biden to commute the federal death row, where 40 men are currently serving a death sentence. CMN Executive Director Krisanne Vaillancourt Murphy said, 'We're in a time-sensitive and urgent moment because the president has constitutional authority and power to take action to commute the federal death row.' President Biden has a unique opportunity to embrace Catholic teaching and save the lives of those 40 men, according to Murphy. The Catholic Church teaches that the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person, as stated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Murphy noted that President Biden's last month in office will overlap with the start of the 2025 Jubilee of Hope, a Holy Year that emphasizes a time to rebalance and recommit to justice and mercy. Pope Francis launched a special call for the abolition of the death penalty in the Bull of Indiction of the 2025 Jubilee, writing, 'In every part of the world, believers, should be one in demanding dignified conditions for those in prison, respect for their human rights, and above all the abolition of the death penalty.' Murphy highlighted that if President Biden were to take this step, it would have reverberations not only in the United States but around the globe.

**Biden administration scrambles to spend funds, approve projects in its final weeks**
The Biden administration is racing against time to spend billions of dollars in grants and approve projects before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. President Biden said, 'Let's make every day count.' Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg stated, 'There's only one administration at a time. Our responsibility is to make good use of the funds that Congress has authorized for us.' The administration is working to ensure that money from the landmark infrastructure and climate laws continues to flow, with announcements of major environmental grants and project approvals speeding up in recent months. The Environmental Protection Agency has set a nationwide deadline for removal of lead pipes and announced nearly $3 billion to help local water systems comply. The Biden administration is also rushing to spend $7.1 billion in weapons and $2.2 billion to put weapons systems on long-term contracts. Additionally, the White House is prioritizing the confirmation of federal judges before Trump's inauguration. Trump has pledged to rescind unspent funds and stop clean-energy development projects.

**DOJ Introduces Rules to Limit Certain Data Transactions in Interest of National Security**
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has introduced a proposed rule to limit certain data transactions that could compromise national security. The rule, issued on October 29, 2024, prohibits and restricts transactions involving bulk sensitive personal data of U.S. citizens or U.S. government-related data, particularly from countries of concern like China. The rule covers sensitive personal data such as human genomic data, biometric identifiers, precise geolocation data, personal health data, and personal financial data. To be covered, a transaction must involve 'bulk thresholds' of 100 to 100,000 U.S. persons. This move builds on President Biden's Executive Order 14117 and comments submitted in response to the DOJ's ANPRM.

**Trump to Repeal 94 Biden Executive Orders After Inauguration**
According to Caroline Livitt, press secretary for Donald Trump's team, Trump plans to repeal 94 executive orders issued by his predecessor Joe Biden within the first seven days of his inauguration. Livitt stated that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris signed dozens of directives to deviate from Trump's 'effective political course', leading to a migration and economic crisis. 'Therefore, Trump was re-elected to reverse the steps taken by the Biden and Harris administration', Livitt explained. The US presidential election took place on November 5, 2024, with Trump and Harris as the main candidates. Trump is currently leading with 312 electoral votes, while Harris has 226. The official results will be confirmed in December.

**Trump Plans to Cancel Biden's Executive Orders**
According to Caroline Livitt, a spokesperson for the Trump team, the newly elected US President Donald Trump plans to cancel a number of executive orders signed by the Biden administration during his first week in office. 'This will be the cancellation of all executive orders signed by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to reverse the effective political course of the first Trump administration,' she said. Livitt added that Trump will sign 'dozens of executive orders' during his first week in office. She also stated that the 94 executive orders signed by Biden during his first week in office 'led to a crisis at the border and an economic crisis.' 'That's why Trump was re-elected as president to give a 'do-over' to the executive orders that the Biden and Harris administration gave him,' Livitt said. Trump won the 2024 US presidential election with 312 electoral votes, defeating incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris.

**Biden Extends US National Emergency with Iran for Another Year**
US President Joe Biden announced that the national emergency with Iran will be extended for another year. Biden stated, 'Our relations with Iran have not been normalized yet, and the implementation of the agreements with Iran dated January 19, 1981, is still ongoing. Therefore, I have decided that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170 regarding Iran.' According to the National Emergency Act, the national emergency will automatically expire unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and submits it to Congress within 90 days, as stated on the White House website. Biden continued, 'I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the notice attached, which states that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170, regarding Iran, which was declared on November 14, 1979, will continue in effect beyond November 14, 2024.'

**Biden administration nears completion of second cybersecurity executive order with plethora of agenda items**
The White House is close to finalizing a second executive order on cybersecurity, which covers a wide range of subjects including artificial intelligence, secure software, cloud security, identity credentialing, and post-quantum cryptography. The order is 95% complete and aims to be signed by President Joe Biden in early December, although some sources view it as 'pretty aspirational' given the president's impending departure. The order includes pilot programs for accelerating next-gen cyber defense AI models, transparency and deployment of secure software, and modernizing federal identity credentialing and access management. Cyber experts have differing views on the order's potential impact, with some questioning the value of additional tasks without funding guarantees and others seeing opportunities for AI to make a big difference in cybersecurity.

**'Biden Bucks' Could Change Elections Forever**
The Biden-Harris administration's Executive Order 14019 has been criticized as 'Biden Bucks' for its potential to alter the election process and favor Democrats. The order directs government agencies to promote voter registration and turnout, but critics argue that the implementation has been biased. Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for The Oversight Project, stated, 'If you target it neutrally, probably not the worst thing in the world. We want civic engagement in the country.' However, Brosnan also noted that the plans submitted by government agencies to promote voter registration have been largely shielded from the public, and that some agencies have partnered with liberal NGOs that push radical ideas such as noncitizen voting and felon voting. Brosnan said, 'They're actually implementing this executive order and putting their thumb on the scale for the federal government to support one candidate over another and juice turnout again.' The potential impact of 'Biden Bucks' on the 2024 presidential election could be significant, especially in Arizona and Michigan, where numerous infirmities in the U.S. election system could dramatically affect the election results.

**Darklore Depository 2024: A Halloween Inventory Of Federal Agency Guidance Documents**
The U.S. Code archives federal laws, while the 186,000-page Code of Federal Regulations contains rules from the daily Federal Register. The Register has reached 86,712 pages, the third-highest annual count of all time, with two months yet to go. Federal agency guidance documents, including statements of policy, memoranda, and notices, are not reliably cataloged and archived. Since 2020, an informal inventory of these documents has been compiled, with the latest spreadsheet unearthing 108,023. Donald Trump's Executive Order 13,891 required public disclosure on agency website portals, but Joe Biden revoked it. The House passed the 'Guidance Out of Darkness (GOOD) Act' to codify similar disclosure portals. Some agencies continue to report guidance, while others have frozen their counts. Many agencies have 'tombstone' landing pages that refer to the now-inoperative Trump E.O. 13,891. Despite decay, some agencies prominently report guidance in 2024, four years out from Trump's directive. Examples include Commerce Department divisions, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Some agencies archive even rescinded, superseded, or inactive guidance, rather than deleting or obscuring it. However, many agencies present no tractable guidance, and the actual quantity of guidance is often indeterminate. The dispensation of federal dollars is an increasingly powerful regulatory mechanism, and the stipulations embedded within grant programs and Notices of Funding Opportunity belong in any compilation of regulatory dark matter.

**Missouri attempts to halt Biden’s voter registration executive order**
The state of Missouri is attempting to overturn a 2021 executive order signed by President Joe Biden that aimed to educate voters about how to register to vote. Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft argued that the order is a federal overreach and that the state already has an election system in place. However, an attorney representing the U.S. Department of Justice stated that the state has failed to present any evidence that the executive order has caused harm. The state's attorney claimed that the order will lead to an added burden for the state by verifying voter registration information shared through federal channels. The case has been taken under advisement by the judge, and it's unclear when a ruling will be issued.

**U.S. Extends National Emergency Over Syria Situation**
The United States has extended the national emergency declared over the situation in Syria. According to Executive Order 13894, the situation in Syria poses an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The emergency was initially declared on October 14, 2019, and has been extended for another year due to the ongoing threat to regional peace and stability. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. stated, 'For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13894 of October 14, 2019, must continue in effect beyond October 14, 2024.' The notice was published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress on October 10, 2024.

**Supreme Court won't hear challenge to Biden voter registration order - Washington Examiner**
The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from Pennsylvania GOP lawmakers challenging President Joe Biden's executive order on voter registration. The order, signed in March 2021, aimed to 'solicit and facilitate' nonpartisan third-party organizations to provide voter registration services on federal agency premises. The lawmakers argued that the order was an unconstitutional attempt to influence the 2020 election and that the authority for regulating federal elections is solely vested in state legislatures. However, Chief Justice John Roberts previously addressed a similar argument in the 2023 case of Moore v. Harper, ruling that the Elections Clause does not insulate state legislatures from judicial review. The denial of the challenge is a blow to groups seeking more transparency behind the executive order's functions, including America First Legal, which has called the order an 'unprecedented election interference program.'

**Supreme Court Won't Hear Challenge to Biden's Order on Voter Registration**
The Supreme Court has rejected a Republican challenge to President Joe Biden's executive order that increased government involvement in voter registration and voter mobilization. The order, which was issued in 2021, requires all federal agencies to help increase voter registration and participation. Republican state lawmakers in Pennsylvania argued that the order was unconstitutional and that voter registration drives aren't a legitimate function of government. However, Judge Jennifer Wilson of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissed the lawsuit, stating that the lawmakers did not have standing to bring the challenge. The judge wrote, '[The individual state lawmakers] did not have standing to bring a challenge to an action that allegedly injured the legislature as a whole.' The lawmakers had requested expedited consideration of the standing issue, so they could obtain a preliminary injunction before the November 2024 election.

**Biden Signs 3D-Printed Gun Crackdown, School Shooter Drill Executive Order**
President Joe Biden signed an executive order on September 26 to crack down on 3D-printed guns and improve active shooter drills in schools. The order targets machine gun conversion devices and 3D-printed guns, which lack serial numbers and are difficult to trace. Biden also called for the expansion of federal law to ban devices like bump stocks, which increase a shooter's rate of fire but don't mechanically alter the gun. The order establishes an emerging firearms threats task force to assess the threat of 3D-printed guns and generate a report within 90 days. Additionally, the order aims to improve active school shooter drills by providing informational resources for schools to reduce and minimize trauma from shooter drills. Harris said, 'I believe the right to be safe is a civil right, and that the people of America have a right then, to live, work, worship and learn without fear of violence—including gun violence.' Second Amendment advocacy groups dismissed the order as campaign rhetoric, saying it will backfire on Kamala Harris's presidential campaign.

**New executive order targets gun violence and gun safety**
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris announced a new executive order to combat gun violence in America, building on the administration's existing efforts to reduce firearm-related deaths. The order targets emerging firearms technologies, including machine gun conversion devices and 3D-printed, unserialized firearms, which have surged in recent years. The administration is also forming an Emerging Firearms Threats Task Force to evaluate the federal government's ability to detect and intercept these weapons. Additionally, the order directs the Secretary of Education and other officials to improve active shooter drills in schools, making them safer and more developmentally appropriate. The administration is also promoting firearm safety, improving background checks, and funding community violence interventions. According to the Gun Violence Archive, homicides fell by 17% and mass shootings declined by 20% in the first six months of 2024. Biden stated, 'These actions are saving lives, but we cannot do it alone. Congress must step up.'

US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled a new executive order to combat 3D printed and converted firearms, and improve schools' active shooter drills. Biden said machine gun conversion devices can be 3D-printed for under 40 cents in under 30 minutes, and are undetectable by security scanners. 'Enough,' Biden said, vowing to keep fighting against gun violence. Harris noted that more children are now killed by guns than any other cause, including car accidents or cancer. The order also directs federal agencies to develop information for schools on how to create and evaluate evidence-informed active shooter drills. Homicides have dropped 17% since Biden created an office on gun violence prevention one year ago, and mass shootings are down 20% in 2024 compared to last year.

**Watch: Joe Biden Brings New Gun Control Law By Way Of US Presidential Order**
US President Joe Biden has announced a new executive order to address the problem of gun violence in the US. The order aims to crack down on emerging firearm threats, including unserialized, 3D-printed guns and machine gun conversion devices. It also directs the Cabinet to improve school-based active shooter drills. According to data, the average number of civilian guns per 100 persons in America was 120.5 guns, more than double that of the next country on the list. Gun violence has been the number one cause of death for children in the US since 2020, with 4,752 children dying from gun-related injuries in 2021. President Biden has called for a complete ban on assault weapons and urged the US Congress to take strong action for gun control. The order is seen as a last-ditch effort by the President to address the issue before the end of his term.

US President Joe Biden signed a bill to continue funding the US government until December 20. According to the White House press release, 'on Thursday, September 26, 2024, the President signed the bill' which provides 'appropriations for projects and activities of executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government through December 20, 2024'. The Senate and House of Representatives previously approved the document on Wednesday. The Biden administration had previously stated that it is necessary to extend the funding of the US government until December 20 and urges both chambers of Congress to pass the corresponding bill as soon as possible. This would prevent a costly and unnecessary shutdown of government funding and give time to pass the 2025 budget later this year, as stated in the administration's statement.

The order also establishes a task force to investigate the threats posed by machine-gun-conversion devices and 3D-printed guns. Gun violence continues to plague the nation, with at least 31 mass killings in the U.S. so far in 2024, leaving at least 135 people dead.

**Biden Takes Aim at 3D-Printed Firearms, Machine-Gun Conversion Devices in Executive Order**
President Joe Biden's administration has released a new executive order aimed at reducing gun violence, targeting machine-gun conversion devices and 3D-printed firearms, as well as improving active-shooter drills in schools. The order comes after a mass shooting in Birmingham, Ala., where local law enforcement believe the shooters used conversion devices. Biden will direct a task force to assess the threat these weapons pose and the federal agencies' operational and legal capacities to detect and seize them. The order also sets out to improve school-based active-shooter drills by keeping guns away from potential school shooters and investing more federal resources in school safety and gun-violence prevention. According to the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, there has been a 17-percent drop in the national homicide rate between January and June, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the Gun Violence Archive reported that the number of mass shootings so far in 2024 has dropped by 20 percent. Biden said, 'The Biden-Harris administration's latest effort to crack down on gun violence.'

**Biden's 'Wahlgeschenk' for Harris: Asylum Restrictions and a Shift in Public Opinion**
US President Biden has signed an executive order on asylum restrictions, taking wind out of the sails of his critics, particularly Vice President Harris. The move has led to a significant decrease in illegal border crossings. According to Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, a politics scientist at the Migration Policy Institute, 'I think it has contributed in many ways to dispelling concerns about a crisis narrative.' The combination of fewer migrant lines at the border and reduced media coverage of the issue has changed the situation for voters, Putzel-Kavanaugh said. With the executive order, Biden has effectively overnight solved Harris' biggest political problem, which was the issue of migration. The number of encounters at the US-Mexico border has decreased significantly, from 250,000 in December 2023 to 58,038 in August 2024, according to the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency. This has taken away a key argument for the Republicans against Harris in the 2024 US election, and has also reduced Trump's lead in the polls on the issue of migration.

**Biden Administration Reports Significant Decrease in Migrant Encounters at US-Mexico Border**
According to US Customs and Border Protection, there was a nearly 68% decrease in encounters with migrants at the border in August 2024 compared to the previous year. Officials attribute this to an executive order issued by President Joe Biden. The White House reported a significant decrease in migrant encounters at the US-Mexico border since Biden's executive order to strengthen immigration law enforcement. The number of migrant encounters in August was significantly lower than the previous year, wrote White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández in a statement. Since Biden's executive order on June 4, there has been a 50% decrease in encounters at the border. According to US Customs and Border Protection, in August there were around 58,000 migrant encounters at ports of entry along the southern border, a nearly 68% decrease from the 181,000 in August 2023. The total number of encounters at the southern border was around 63,000. This number includes around 5,000 migrants who arrived at ports of entry without a CBP One registration. CBP One is a mobile app that allows migrants to schedule appointments at ports of entry instead of crossing illegally. US border officials said the app has played a crucial role in streamlining border processes. In August, around 44,700 people were processed through CBP One. Since its introduction in January 2023, over 813,000 people have scheduled appointments. US border officials also said that the June executive actions led to an increase in deportations of migrants, with over 131,000 people deported to more than 140 countries since June. Around 400 international repatriation flights have taken place during this time. However, even with the latest numbers, some Republican lawmakers criticized the Biden administration during a hearing on Thursday to discuss possible terrorist threats and national security issues related to illegal immigration. Lawmakers argued that the perception of border agents as welcoming, rather than focused on law enforcement, is contributing to the number of migrants arriving in the US. 'Our border patrol, our law enforcement agents were moved from their role of national security, their role of enforcing immigration law [to] repel illegal entry and capture those crossing illegally as much as possible to a kind of reception and care and transportation, food, etc.,' said Rep. Clay Higgins, a Republican from Alabama, expressing his concern about migrants crossing illegally and evading Border Patrol. There is no indication that the Biden administration has officially changed the role of Border Patrol agents in law enforcement. Alex Nowrasteh, vice president of economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, testified during the hearing that the main reason migrants come to the US, legally or illegally, is to work. 'It's still the economy. That's what attracts people, and the rapid economic recovery after COVID-19 may explain more than any other factor,' he said.
