**Questions raised about Trump’s ability to fire 50,000 federal employees**
A proposal in Project 2025, a blueprint for a second Trump Administration, suggests firing 50,000 federal government employees and replacing them with Trump/MAGA loyalists. However, author Jay Michaelson questions the feasibility of this plan, citing the Pendleton Act of 1883, which created a civil service system that protects employees from political interference. Michaelson notes that a loophole in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 allows for the exemption of certain positions from civil service protections, but argues that 'the purge won't happen overnight.' A survey by the Partnership for Public Service found that 87% of Americans believe a nonpartisan civil service is important for a strong democracy. Trump has claimed that he had nothing to do with Project 2025, but the parallels between Project 2025 and his own Agenda 47 are clear, including a plan to give the federal workforce a 'MAGA makeover.'

**Catholics urge US President Biden to commute federal death row - Vatican News**
The Catholic Mobilizing Network (CMN) is urging US President Joe Biden to commute the federal death row, where 40 men are currently serving a death sentence. CMN Executive Director Krisanne Vaillancourt Murphy said, 'We're in a time-sensitive and urgent moment because the president has constitutional authority and power to take action to commute the federal death row.' President Biden has a unique opportunity to embrace Catholic teaching and save the lives of those 40 men, according to Murphy. The Catholic Church teaches that the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person, as stated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Murphy noted that President Biden's last month in office will overlap with the start of the 2025 Jubilee of Hope, a Holy Year that emphasizes a time to rebalance and recommit to justice and mercy. Pope Francis launched a special call for the abolition of the death penalty in the Bull of Indiction of the 2025 Jubilee, writing, 'In every part of the world, believers, should be one in demanding dignified conditions for those in prison, respect for their human rights, and above all the abolition of the death penalty.' Murphy highlighted that if President Biden were to take this step, it would have reverberations not only in the United States but around the globe.

**Trump's 'Efficiency Department' Sparks Concerns: Will the Federal Government Be Downsized?**
Donald Trump's transition team spokesperson refused to comment on the report that President Biden authorized Ukraine to use powerful American remote weapons in Russia. Ramaswamy, who will lead the Department of Efficiency in the new government, pointed out that the Department of Defense, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services are the target areas. Trump's transition team spokesperson said that Trump is the only one who can bring both sides together for peace talks and end the war, as Trump promised during his campaign. However, outsiders expect that the negotiations will force Ukraine to cede some territory. Trump recently announced that Musk and Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Efficiency in the new government. CNN reported that Ramaswamy will target the Department of Defense, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services, and hinted that the government may use the legal basis to implement cuts. He said that the first step of the Department of Efficiency will be to reduce federal spending through administrative actions. Some institutions will be completely abolished, and the bloated federal government will undergo massive layoffs. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that President-elect Trump is using 'revolutionaries' to lead the incoming government, which will change the status quo. BBC reported that Trump's nominees have sparked controversy in Washington and raised concerns among both parties. However, those close to Trump said that if the nominees cannot get the necessary support, they have already prepared a backup plan. Trump's son said, 'We know who the good guys and the bad guys are.'

**Biden Extends US National Emergency with Iran for Another Year**
US President Joe Biden announced that the national emergency with Iran will be extended for another year. Biden stated, 'Our relations with Iran have not been normalized yet, and the implementation of the agreements with Iran dated January 19, 1981, is still ongoing. Therefore, I have decided that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170 regarding Iran.' According to the National Emergency Act, the national emergency will automatically expire unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and submits it to Congress within 90 days, as stated on the White House website. Biden continued, 'I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the notice attached, which states that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170, regarding Iran, which was declared on November 14, 1979, will continue in effect beyond November 14, 2024.'

**Biden administration nears completion of second cybersecurity executive order with plethora of agenda items**
The White House is close to finalizing a second executive order on cybersecurity, which covers a wide range of subjects including artificial intelligence, secure software, cloud security, identity credentialing, and post-quantum cryptography. The order is 95% complete and aims to be signed by President Joe Biden in early December, although some sources view it as 'pretty aspirational' given the president's impending departure. The order includes pilot programs for accelerating next-gen cyber defense AI models, transparency and deployment of secure software, and modernizing federal identity credentialing and access management. Cyber experts have differing views on the order's potential impact, with some questioning the value of additional tasks without funding guarantees and others seeing opportunities for AI to make a big difference in cybersecurity.

**'Biden Bucks' Could Change Elections Forever**
The Biden-Harris administration's Executive Order 14019 has been criticized as 'Biden Bucks' for its potential to alter the election process and favor Democrats. The order directs government agencies to promote voter registration and turnout, but critics argue that the implementation has been biased. Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for The Oversight Project, stated, 'If you target it neutrally, probably not the worst thing in the world. We want civic engagement in the country.' However, Brosnan also noted that the plans submitted by government agencies to promote voter registration have been largely shielded from the public, and that some agencies have partnered with liberal NGOs that push radical ideas such as noncitizen voting and felon voting. Brosnan said, 'They're actually implementing this executive order and putting their thumb on the scale for the federal government to support one candidate over another and juice turnout again.' The potential impact of 'Biden Bucks' on the 2024 presidential election could be significant, especially in Arizona and Michigan, where numerous infirmities in the U.S. election system could dramatically affect the election results.

**‘Biden Bucks’ Could Change Elections Forever**
The Biden-Harris administration has implemented an executive order, Executive Order 14019, to increase federal involvement in American elections by registering voters and turning out the vote. Critics have dubbed this 'Biden Bucks', suggesting it is a plan to maintain Democratic power. Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for The Oversight Project at The Heritage Foundation, stated, 'If you target it neutrally, probably not the worst thing in the world. We want civic engagement in the country.' However, the implementation has been criticized for being anything but neutral. The article also touches on the globalists' goal of controlling protein sources, specifically targeting beef as the environmental boogeyman, and promoting lab-grown meat or vegetable-based proteins instead.

**Darklore Depository 2024: A Halloween Inventory Of Federal Agency Guidance Documents**
The U.S. Code archives federal laws, while the 186,000-page Code of Federal Regulations contains rules from the daily Federal Register. The Register has reached 86,712 pages, the third-highest annual count of all time, with two months yet to go. Federal agency guidance documents, including statements of policy, memoranda, and notices, are not reliably cataloged and archived. Since 2020, an informal inventory of these documents has been compiled, with the latest spreadsheet unearthing 108,023. Donald Trump's Executive Order 13,891 required public disclosure on agency website portals, but Joe Biden revoked it. The House passed the 'Guidance Out of Darkness (GOOD) Act' to codify similar disclosure portals. Some agencies continue to report guidance, while others have frozen their counts. Many agencies have 'tombstone' landing pages that refer to the now-inoperative Trump E.O. 13,891. Despite decay, some agencies prominently report guidance in 2024, four years out from Trump's directive. Examples include Commerce Department divisions, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Some agencies archive even rescinded, superseded, or inactive guidance, rather than deleting or obscuring it. However, many agencies present no tractable guidance, and the actual quantity of guidance is often indeterminate. The dispensation of federal dollars is an increasingly powerful regulatory mechanism, and the stipulations embedded within grant programs and Notices of Funding Opportunity belong in any compilation of regulatory dark matter.

**Missouri attempts to halt Biden’s voter registration executive order**
The state of Missouri is attempting to overturn a 2021 executive order signed by President Joe Biden that aimed to educate voters about how to register to vote. Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft argued that the order is a federal overreach and that the state already has an election system in place. However, an attorney representing the U.S. Department of Justice stated that the state has failed to present any evidence that the executive order has caused harm. The state's attorney claimed that the order will lead to an added burden for the state by verifying voter registration information shared through federal channels. The case has been taken under advisement by the judge, and it's unclear when a ruling will be issued.

**US Supreme Court Rejects Republican Challenge to Biden's Voter Registration Order**
The US Supreme Court has rejected a Republican challenge to President Joe Biden's executive order increasing government involvement in voter registration and mobilization. The court denied the petition in the case of Keefer v. Biden without comment, with no dissenting judges. The order requires all federal agencies, including the prison system, to help increase voter registration and participation and promote mail-in voting. Critics say it will likely benefit Democrats more than Republicans. The main petitioner is Pennsylvania state Representative Dawn Keefer, a Republican. The 27 Republican state legislators from Pennsylvania challenged Biden's Executive Order 14019 of March 7, 2021, which requires all federal agencies to help increase voter registration and participation. They argued that the order was unconstitutional and that voter registration campaigns are not a legitimate function of government. They also challenged a voter registration order issued by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat. The legislators argued in their lawsuit that the executive actions violated their constitutional rights by usurping their power to prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections. Judge Jennifer Wilson of the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissed the lawsuit on March 26. 'The legislators were not legitimate to challenge an action that supposedly harmed the legislative assembly as a whole,' she wrote. 'They only alleged an institutional harm derived from a general loss of legislative power.' 'A vague and general allegation that elections, in general, will be undermined, is not the type of case or controversy that this court can pronounce on under Article III [of the US Constitution].' The legislators told the Supreme Court that they wanted an expedited consideration of the issue of standing, so if they prevail, 'they may obtain a preliminary injunction in the district court much before the November 2024 elections.'

**Supreme Court won’t hear challenge to Biden voter registration order**
The Supreme Court has declined to hear a challenge from Pennsylvania Republican lawmakers to a Biden administration executive order aimed at boosting voter registration. The order, signed in March 2021, allows nonpartisan third-party organizations to provide voter registration services on federal agency premises. The lawmakers claimed the order was unconstitutional and an attempt to influence the 2020 election. However, Chief Justice John Roberts previously addressed a similar argument in a 2023 decision, ruling that state legislatures are not insulated from state judicial review. The denial of the challenge is a blow to groups seeking more transparency behind the executive order's functions, including America First Legal, which has called the order an 'unprecedented election interference program'.

The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from Pennsylvania GOP lawmakers challenging President Joe Biden's executive order on voter registration. The order, signed in March 2021, aimed to 'solicit and facilitate' nonpartisan third-party organizations to provide voter registration services on federal agency premises. The lawmakers argued that the order was an unconstitutional attempt to influence the 2020 election and that the authority for regulating federal elections is solely vested in state legislatures. However, Chief Justice John Roberts previously addressed a similar argument in the 2023 case of Moore v. Harper, ruling that the Elections Clause does not insulate state legislatures from judicial review.

President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris announced new measures to combat gun violence in America, including a new Executive Order that targets emerging firearm threats and enhances school safety. The administration has made significant progress in gun violence prevention, with a 17% decline in homicides and a 20% decline in mass shootings from January to June 2024. The new Executive Order focuses on machinegun conversion devices and 3D-printed, unserialized firearms, which are increasingly found at crime scenes. The administration is forming an Emerging Firearms Threats Task Force to evaluate the federal government's ability to detect and intercept these weapons. Additionally, the administration is promoting firearm safety, improving background checks, and funding community violence interventions. Biden stated, 'These actions are saving lives, but we cannot do it alone. Congress must step up. Every day, we delay, more lives are at risk.'

US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled a new executive order to combat 3D printed and converted firearms, and improve schools' active shooter drills. Biden said machine gun conversion devices can be 3D-printed for under 40 cents in under 30 minutes, and are undetectable by security scanners. 'Enough,' Biden said, vowing to keep fighting against gun violence. Harris noted that more children are now killed by guns than any other cause, including car accidents or cancer. The order also directs federal agencies to develop information for schools on how to create and evaluate evidence-informed active shooter drills. Homicides have dropped 17% since Biden created an office on gun violence prevention one year ago, and mass shootings are down 20% in 2024 compared to last year.

**Ahead of the Election, Biden Rolls Out New Executive Action on Guns**
President Joe Biden has signed an executive order to create a federal task force to combat 'emerging firearms threats,' including cheap devices that can convert semiautomatic pistols into fully automatic machine guns. The task force, which will be responsible for developing a plan to combat machine gun conversion devices, has 90 days to issue a report. The executive order also seeks to crack down on 3D-printed guns and improve school active shooter drills. Biden said, 'The streets are flooded with machine gun conversion devices because the parts are small, cheap, and easy to make. The impact of these devices is devastating.' The task force will be composed of leaders from several federal departments and agencies. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said, 'We've been working with our U.S. attorney, with the Justice Department, to get machine gun conversions like Glock switches off our city streets.' Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'For as much as we have accomplished, more must be done. We need more leaders like the leaders in this room, in Congress, who have the courage to take action, to stand up to the gun lobby, and to put the lives of our children first.' The work may build on the administration's previous efforts to combat 'ghost guns.' 3D-printed firearms are typically produced at home with computer code downloaded from the internet and often lack a serial number, making them undetectable by law enforcement. Stefanie Feldman, the director of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, said, 'Some 3D-printed firearms can be made to be undetectable by magnetometers used to secure airports, courthouses and event spaces.' A second provision of the executive order aims to improve school-based active shooter drills, which have come under increasing scrutiny as parents, students, and educators say that some versions of the drills are traumatic. Christian Heyne, the president of the gun violence prevention group Brady, said in a statement, 'The Biden-Harris administration has been the strongest gun violence prevention administration in history, and today's news tells us they have no intention of slowing down.'

**Biden Signs Bill to Continue US Government Funding Until December 20**
US President Joe Biden signed a bill to continue funding the US government until December 20. According to the White House press release, 'on Thursday, September 26, 2024, the President signed the bill' which provides 'appropriations for projects and activities of executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government through December 20, 2024'. The Senate and House of Representatives previously approved the document on Wednesday. The Biden administration had previously stated that it is necessary to extend the funding of the US government until December 20 and urges both chambers of Congress to pass the corresponding bill as soon as possible. This would prevent a costly and unnecessary shutdown of government funding and give time to pass the 2025 budget later this year, as stated in the administration's statement.

**Biden orders schools to make active shooter drills less traumatic for students**
President Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive order on Thursday that aims to make active shooter drills less traumatic for students while still being effective. The order also seeks to restrict new technologies that make guns easier to fire and obtain. According to Stefanie Feldman, the director of Biden's office of gun violence prevention, the order will help schools create drills that 'maximize their effectiveness and limit any collateral harms they might cause.' The order also establishes a task force to investigate the threats posed by machine-gun-conversion devices and 3D-printed guns. Gun violence continues to plague the nation, with at least 31 mass killings in the U.S. so far in 2024, leaving at least 135 people dead. The order was praised by gun-control groups, but criticized by the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, who said it was 'just one more attempt by the Biden-Harris Administration to deflect attention from their soft-on-crime policies.'

**Biden Takes Aim at 3D-Printed Firearms, Machine-Gun Conversion Devices in Executive Order**
President Joe Biden's administration has released a new executive order aimed at reducing gun violence, targeting machine-gun conversion devices and 3D-printed firearms, as well as improving active-shooter drills in schools. The order comes after a mass shooting in Birmingham, Ala., where local law enforcement believe the shooters used conversion devices. Biden will direct a task force to assess the threat these weapons pose and the federal agencies' operational and legal capacities to detect and seize them. The order also sets out to improve school-based active-shooter drills by keeping guns away from potential school shooters and investing more federal resources in school safety and gun-violence prevention. According to the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, there has been a 17-percent drop in the national homicide rate between January and June, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the Gun Violence Archive reported that the number of mass shootings so far in 2024 has dropped by 20 percent. Biden said, 'The Biden-Harris administration's latest effort to crack down on gun violence.'

**Biden signs order on gun technology, orders research on active shooter drills to limit harm**
President Joe Biden signed an executive order to restrict new technologies that make guns easier to fire and obtain. The order also directs research on active shooter drills to limit harm and establishes a task force to investigate threats posed by machine-gun-conversion devices and 3D-printed guns. Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'It is a false choice to suggest you are either in favor of the Second Amendment, or you want to take everyone's guns away.' Harris believes the right to be safe is a civil right and that means a right to live free from gun violence. The order aims to curb violence, help communities recover from trauma, and coordinate the federal response. According to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today, there have been at least 31 mass killings in the U.S. so far in 2024, leaving at least 135 people dead. Gun-control groups praised the order, but the NRA criticized it as 'just one more attempt by the Biden-Harris Administration to deflect attention from their soft-on-crime policies.'
