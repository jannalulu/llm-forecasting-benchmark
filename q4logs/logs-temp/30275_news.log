**Nifty Trading Plan: Can Bank Nifty Outperform Nifty Today, 51,000 Level in Sight?**
The Nifty 50 Index has been in a downward trend for the seventh consecutive trading session, falling below 23,500 on November 18. Most technical indicators are showing bearish signals, but the RSI (Relative Strength Index) has reached the oversold level. If the index remains below 23,500, a further decline to 23,300-23,200 cannot be ruled out. However, if it reverses, resistance is expected in the 23,600-23,700 range, according to experts.

**Robinhood Soars 6%--But Is It a Game-Changer or Fool's Gold?**
Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) stock rose 6% today, with analysts upgrading their predictions due to potential regulatory shifts and new crypto products. However, the company's user base has declined by 48% since 2021, and transaction revenue is trailing its pandemic-era highs. Additionally, interest income, which was a saving grace during rate hikes, is starting to decline. With a high price-to-sales ratio and revenue headwinds, some experts consider Robinhood a 'risky FOMO trap' rather than a 'screaming buy'. As one analyst warned, 'tread carefully, what's dazzling today can sometimes lose its shine tomorrow.'

**Why Robinhood's CEO thinks prediction markets are here to stay**
Kalshi's prediction market was the number one app on Election Day, with its stats showing the Trump campaign winning by a landslide hours before news networks called the race. The CEO of Polymarket claims the Trump campaign first realized they were winning from Kalshi's stats. Robinhood's CEO, Vlad Tenev, believes prediction markets are a better 'wisdom of the crowd' indicator than polls and sees a future where Robinhood's users can bet on various things, including stock performance. Tenev thinks the growing interest in prediction markets reflects a 'distrust of traditional news' that's changing how people seek information.

**Kalshi And Polymarket Shoot To The Top Of Apple's App Store Rankings Amid Election Euphoria - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)**
On the day of the U.S. presidential election, prediction platforms Kalshi and Polymarket reached unprecedented rankings on Apple's App Store. Kalshi, a federally-regulated betting platform, became the number one free app in the 'Finance' category, while Polymarket, a cryptocurrency-based platform, topped the 'Magazine & Newspapers' and 'News' categories. The growth was staggering, with Kalshi rising from 55th to 1st in the free app category and Polymarket jumping from 108th to 2nd in the same category. The surge in interest in predicting election outcomes drove the rankings, with both platforms allowing users to place bets on various election-related markets. Notably, a French 'Trump Whale' known as Theo netted almost $50 million on Polymarket following Trump's victory, while Harris' biggest backer, Redegen, lost around $6.7 million.

**Rising interest in election betting drives Kalshi, Polymarket to top Apple’s free app rankings**
Kalshi and Polymarket, two prediction markets, have topped the Apple App Store's free app downloads, pushing popular apps like ChatGPT and Google down the list. Kalshi, which operates under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), relaunched its 2024 presidential election betting market after a federal court victory. Polymarket, a decentralized peer-to-peer platform based on blockchain technology, has seen a jump in popularity despite operating without U.S.-based bets due to past regulatory challenges. According to Luana Lopes Lara, cofounder of Kalshi, 'prediction markets are the future.' Despite regulatory constraints, Polymarket's 2024 election contract recorded over $2.8 billion in wagers, while Kalshi's 2024 market generated a handle of under $300 million.

Kalshi, ranked No. 1, and Polymarket, at No. 2, have become the most downloaded free apps, surpassing other popular applications. Kalshi, the only prediction market operating in the US that is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has seen significant activity, with its 2024 White House outcome contract having a handle of less than $300 million. In contrast, Polymarket's 2024 election contract has already fielded over $2.8 billion in wagers. The betting markets reflect a strong preference for Trump, with his shares trading at 61 cents on Polymarket and 58 cents on Kalshi. Kalshi cofounder Luana Lopes Lara expressed confidence in prediction markets, stating, 'Prediction markets are the future.'

**Kalshi first, Polymarket fourth in financial category of Apple App Store on Election Day**
On Election Day, November 5, 2024, prediction platforms Kalshi and Polymarket reached top spots on the Apple App Store. Kalshi now ranks first in Apple's finance app category and third overall among free apps, while Polymarket is the fourth-highest ranking app in the finance app category. This represents both apps' highest placement to date, likely driven by interest in betting on election outcomes. Kalshi's market for the 2024 U.S. presidential winner, featuring former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, grew to $247 million, while Polymarket maintains $3.26 billion in total betting volume for the same market. Since launching in 2020, Polymarket has amassed $5.15 billion in cumulative trading volume. As a result of a federal court ruling, Kalshi was allowed to list election betting contracts in early October, after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sought to strictly regulate these 'event contracts.'

**The election-betting market has exploded in popularity this presidential cycle**
The popularity of election-betting platforms has exploded in the 2024 presidential election cycle. Robinhood has launched its own election-betting platform, while Kalshi has seen a surge in popularity and trading volume, with over $100 million in bets placed on the election outcome. Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour said, 'I think we're gunning for No. 1 for the entire App Store by Election Day, so the demand curve truly is exponential.' Polymarket, which is not available to US citizens, has seen a massive increase in trading volume, with nearly $2 billion wagered in October, quadruple the amount wagered in September. However, there has also been scrutiny of the betting itself, with a 'whale' trader placing over $30 million in bets on the outcome of the US election.

According to Tarek Mansour, CEO of Kalshi, 'I think we're going to hit number one for the entire App Store by election day, so the demand curve is really exponential.' Polymarket, which is not available to American citizens, has seen an explosion in trading volume this year, with nearly $2 billion bet on the site in October, quadruple the $533 million bet in September and over 10 times the $39 million bet in April.

**Robinhood Launches Presidential Election Betting Contracts**
Robinhood, a fintech company, has announced that its derivatives division has launched contracts for the US presidential election. Users of the platform can now place bets on the outcome of the election, which will take place on November 5, 2024. According to the company, the contracts will be settled after January 6, 2025, when the US Congress confirms the election results. However, there are restrictions - only US citizens can place bets, and those who work for the election campaigns of Republican or Democratic candidates are excluded. Robinhood aims to democratize finance for all, regardless of who is in power. As stated on the company's official website, 'We allow our clients to place bets on the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, but the results and market fluctuations in real-time do not indicate support for any of the candidates.' This move follows Kalshi's victory in a court case against the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which allowed the betting platform to continue offering users in the US the ability to place bets on election outcomes.

**Robinhood launches contracts for betting on US Presidential Election | Stock Market News**
Robinhood has announced that it will begin offering US presidential election event contracts, enabling users to profit from speculating on the competitive race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. The new feature will be rolled out to a limited number of users, who must be US citizens. This move comes as event derivatives trading has grown in popularity, with platforms like PredictIt and Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR) and Kalshi also offering contracts for betting on the US Election. Robinhood's stock has surged by over 100% year-to-date, as the company continues to evolve from a platform for retail investors to a comprehensive financial services provider.

**It's getting easier for Americans to bet on the 2024 election**
A recent federal court ruling has made it easier for Americans to bet on the 2024 presidential election. Robinhood is the latest platform to offer US citizens a chance to bet on the election, with shares of the company going up slightly after the announcement. The platform previously said it would allow investors to trade the outcome of events through its derivatives unit. Kalshi, a New York-based market, prevailed in DC District Court over the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, allowing for wider betting on US elections. CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam has strongly opposed election betting, but some 2024 hopefuls are taking notice of the wagers. Sen. JD Vance commented on Trump's Kalshi odds, saying 'Honestly, I think that chart's about right. I think that we've probably got about a 60% chance of winning.'

**Robinhood admits it’s just a gambling app**
Robinhood, a financial app, has announced that users can now bet on the outcome of the upcoming US presidential election. The company describes this as 'unlocking a new asset class that democratizes access to events as they unfold.' However, critics argue that this is simply a way to open a betting market, and that the phrase 'democratizes access' is misleading. Robinhood's move comes after a court ruling allowed a similar platform, Kalshi, to offer political event contracts. The article also notes that election markets can be skewed by individual bettors, and that betting markets are not always accurate. Additionally, the article suggests that Robinhood's primary focus is on fun gambling, citing a quote from Bloomberg's Matt Levine: 'Robinhood is the brokerage for fun gambling on meme stocks and meme cryptocurrencies.'

**Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour On The Growing Election Betting Market: 'A Coin Flip With A Bias' - Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD)**
Kalshi's CEO Tarek Mansour described the company's election betting platform as 'a coin flip with a bias,' highlighting its rapid growth to $200 million in trades and overtaking Cash App in U.S. finance app rankings. Mansour noted that Kalshi's election markets reflect user-driven probabilities, distinct from traditional polling data, and offer a transparent and regulated platform for Americans to place bets on the 2024 presidential race. The company's success has led to Robinhood's introduction of election contracts, and other platforms like Interactive Brokers have added election-related products, pointing to an increasing demand for regulated election markets. Kalshi's platform offers nearly 100 election-related markets with substantial liquidity, enabling a broad range of betting options. Mansour emphasized that Kalshi's market allows users to place significantly larger bets without influencing market prices, with average wagers at around $300 to $400. He also envisions prediction markets as an emerging 'source of truth' for public interest topics, from Fed rate decisions to CEO appointments.

**Robinhood Launches US Presidential Election Prediction Market -- For Americans Only - Decrypt**
Robinhood has launched a US presidential election prediction market, allowing traders to speculate on whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris will win the election. The move comes as the election approaches its climax, with seven days left to go. Unlike other platforms, Robinhood's offering is purely US-focused and is offered through ForecastEx, a futures commission merchant regulated by the CFTC. The platform has restrictions in place, including a ban on US presidential election or politics-related individuals and a requirement for bettors to be approved by Robinhood Derivatives. The market will resolve two months after the election, on January 7, 2025, after results are certified by Congress. This move represents the increasing mainstream acceptance of political betting, and follows a major legal victory for prediction market platform Kalshi over the CFTC, as well as the entry of Interactive Brokers into the election betting scene.

Robinhood has introduced contracts for users to speculate on the 2024 US presidential election outcome. Eligible US citizens can buy 'Yes' contracts, which settle after the January certification. Competitors like Kalshi and Polymarket offer similar high-demand prediction markets. Robinhood limits participation to US citizens with an individual investing account that qualifies for specific features, such as margin investing or Level 2/3 options trading. Users can close positions before the election outcome is known by purchasing an opposing 'No' contract to offset an existing 'Yes' position. Robinhood does not permit users to hold concurrent 'Yes' positions on multiple candidates. This move places Robinhood in direct competition with established prediction platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket.

**Robinhood's Election Contracts Spark Competition in Prediction Markets**
Robinhood has launched event contracts that allow users to make predictions on the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election. Following a favorable court ruling, the company will compete with other platforms that offer similar services. The interest in prediction markets has increased, and Robinhood has started to offer limited access to its election contracts. Eligible users, including individual investors who are US citizens and have a margin account or level 2/3 options trading approval, will be able to trade on the likelihood of each candidate winning. The competition among prediction platforms is heating up, with Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour stating that their platform has become the leader in the finance App Store and has surpassed Facebook and Uber in global rankings. Kalshi's average bet size is around $300-400, while some users are creating positions worth millions of dollars. The platform offers much higher liquidity compared to Robinhood. The court's decision in favor of Kalshi is shaping the industry, with other major platforms like Interactive Brokers also entering the election contract market despite CFTC's objections. The value of Robinhood's contracts can reach up to $1, depending on demand, and payments will be made on January 8, 2025. However, the platform does not allow users to hold simultaneous 'Yes' positions for multiple candidates.

**Robinhood jumps into election trading, giving users chance to buy Harris or Trump contracts**
Robinhood, a popular brokerage platform, has entered the prediction betting market, allowing users to trade contracts for the 2024 presidential election. Starting Monday, users can buy contracts for either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, as long as they meet certain criteria, including being a U.S. citizen. This move comes after a recent ruling in favor of Kalshi, a platform that offers election outcome trading, and the launch of similar contracts by Interactive Brokers. Robinhood believes that event contracts will 'give people a tool to engage in real-time decision-making, unlocking a new asset class that democratizes access to events as they unfold,' according to a statement. However, concerns have been raised about the potential for market manipulation, particularly after an investigation found that a single user was responsible for millions of dollars in trading on the Trump contract on the Polymarket platform.

**CFTC Calls Court Ruling in Kalshi Case an 'Error', Files Appeal**
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed an appeal in the case against Kalshi, a market for predictions. The CFTC believes that the court's previous decision was an 'error' and has asked it to be overturned. The CFTC argues that the court misinterpreted the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, thereby limiting the Commission's authority. The regulator also reiterated its argument that bets on political events are a form of gambling, citing the use of specialized terminology. According to the CFTC, '...the Commission found that contracts can negatively impact the integrity of elections or the perception of election integrity by creating financial incentives for voting (including organized groups) for candidates or by stimulating the spread of disinformation to influence markets, and that markets can be used to influence the perception of elections.' Kalshi's team has not commented on the situation. However, the platform's founder, Tarek Mansour, noted on his X page that Kalshi has surpassed the popularity of Fidelity and Robinhood clients: 'Kalshi just flipped both Robinhood and Fidelity on the Appstore.' In September 2024, the platform won a lawsuit against the CFTC, but the regulator immediately filed an appeal, requesting a temporary ban that prevented the platform from opening bets on political events. This measure was later lifted, but the CFTC's appeal remains in place. Kalshi is currently accepting bets, but this may change in the future pending the upcoming rehearing.
