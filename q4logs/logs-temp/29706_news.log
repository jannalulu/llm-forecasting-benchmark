**China's Exports Surpass Expectations, But Uncertainty Looms with Trump's Potential Return**
China's exports in October exceeded expectations, increasing by 12.7% compared to the same period last year, according to the Beijing Customs Administration. Analysts had predicted a 5% increase. In contrast, Chinese imports were weaker than expected, decreasing by 2.3% in the same period. The Chinese economy has been struggling due to a housing market crisis, weak domestic demand, and high youth unemployment. To boost the economy, the central bank has lowered interest rates for mortgage loans. Observers are hoping for further measures, which could be announced this week. However, a potential return of Donald Trump to the White House could bring new uncertainties to Chinese trade. Trump's previous trade war with China, initiated during his first term, led to significant tensions. Experts fear that a renewed trade conflict could harm China's economic recovery and the global economy.

**China Creates 2.45 Million Jobs through Job Assistance Programs**
China has promoted local government-led job assistance programs, including key projects and agricultural and rural infrastructure initiatives, to boost employment. According to the National Development and Reform Commission, these programs created 2.45 million jobs for low-income workers in the first three quarters of 2024, a 30.2% year-over-year increase. Additionally, they distributed 31 billion yuan (approximately $4.35 billion) in salaries, a 22.7% increase from the previous year. The programs target vulnerable individuals, including rural residents who have escaped poverty, those at risk of returning to poverty, and migrant workers who have returned to their hometowns. The commission will continue to emphasize the role of these initiatives in creating jobs and improving income for low-income workers.

**Youth Unemployment Rate in China Drops to 17.6% in September**
The youth unemployment rate in China decreased to 17.6% in September, down from the peak of 18.8% in August, when millions of university graduates entered the job market, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Tuesday, October 22. The still high rate highlights tensions in the Chinese labor market and is in line with the trend indicated by numbers released last week, which showed that the overall unemployment rate stood at 5.1% in September, compared to 5.3% in August.

**Youth Unemployment in China Declines Slightly in September**
China's youth unemployment rate for 16-to-24-year-olds decreased to 17.6% in September, down from 18.8% in August. This slight improvement brings relief to authorities after two consecutive months of soaring youth unemployment. However, officials remain cautious due to factory owners' continued hesitancy to hire, with the last positive employment report for producers dating back to February 2023. According to the data, individuals aged 25 to 29 reported a jobless rate of 6.7%, while those aged 30 to 59 reported a rate of 3.9%, both figures excluding college students. As one official noted, 'Despite the slight improvement, we still have a long way to go in addressing the issue of youth unemployment.'

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Decreases to 17.6% in September**
China has announced that the unemployment rate for 16-24 year olds has slightly decreased to 17.6% in September, a figure closely watched as the country tries to revive its slowing economy. This rate, which does not include high school students and university students, is still high but lower than the 18.8% recorded in August, the highest level since the beginning of 2024, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China. The increase in the number of university graduates in June, with nearly 12 million students obtaining their diplomas, has added to the competition on the already difficult job market, which explains the sharp rise in unemployment this summer and its slight decline last month as some hiring took place. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, had declared in May that fighting youth unemployment should be considered an 'absolute priority'. The unemployment rate for 25-29 year olds has also decreased from 6.9% in August to 6.7% in September, and the overall unemployment rate for the country has decreased from 5.3% to 5.1%.

**Youth Unemployment Rate in China Decreases to 17.6%**
According to the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the youth unemployment rate for those aged 16-24, excluding students, decreased to 17.6% in September. This is a decline from the peak of 18.8% in August, when millions of university graduates entered the job market. The rate is consistent with the numbers released last week, which showed a general unemployment rate of 5.1% in September, down from 5.3% in August. The labor statistics come after China's economy reported a 4.6% year-over-year growth in July-September, which is slightly better than expectations but still the slowest pace in six quarters. The National Bureau of Statistics had suspended the release of youth unemployment data in June last year, when it hit a record high of 21.3%, and resumed it in January this year with a revised methodology that excludes students. Economists say this change makes the metric less reliable.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Decreases Slightly After Two Months of Increase**
According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China, the youth unemployment rate in the country has decreased slightly after two months of increase. The rate, which affects people between 16 and 24 years old, rose significantly during the summer, from 13.2% in June to 17.1% in July and 18.8% in August, a record high after the authorities revised the methodology of the indicator at the end of last year to exclude students. The poor employment data for young people in the summer was due to the entry of a record number of graduates into the labor market - an estimated 12 million this year - and increasingly bleak job market prospects, affected by the slowdown in the recovery of the world's second-largest economy, reported local media. The Chinese government has made youth employment a top priority, both due to the negative impact on consumption of potential income decline and the risks to social stability, a vital issue for Beijing. Chinese authorities expressed confidence on Friday that the world's second-largest economy 'will continue on a trend of stabilization and recovery', after announcing a stimulus package with measures to support the financial and real estate sectors and the stock market, in order to relaunch the recovery of the world's second-largest economy. Analysts stated that the package of measures is 'a step in the right direction', but 'insufficient' to relaunch the economic recovery of China, unless accompanied by an increase in public spending, a question that may collide with concerns about the sustainability of the debt. Low domestic and international demand, associated with risks of deflation, insufficient stimuli, housing crisis, and lack of confidence from consumers and the private sector are some of the causes pointed out by analysts to explain what is happening in the world's second-largest economy.

**China's youth unemployment rate falls after climbing for 2 months**
China's youth unemployment rate fell to 17.6% in September, down from 18.8% in August, according to official data. This decline comes after two consecutive months of rising youth unemployment. The rate for 25-to-29-year olds was 6.7%, and 3.9% for people between 30 and 59 years of age. Officials expressed confidence that the trend of stabilization and recovery would continue, but a separate survey showed that firms continued to hold off on hiring last month. As one official noted, 'the stabilisation and recovery trend that occurred in September' is expected to continue. However, the survey also showed that producers last reported improving employment conditions in February 2023, indicating that hiring has not yet fully recovered.

**China's Youth Jobless Rate Falls After Hitting a Peak**
China's youth unemployment rate fell to 17.6% in September, down from the peak of 18.8% in August, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics. This decrease is in line with the overall headline unemployment rate, which stood at 5.1% in September, compared to 5.3% in August. The job numbers come after China's economy reported a 4.6% expansion in the July-September period, which was slightly better than expected but still marked the slowest pace in six quarters. Economists are closely watching to see if Beijing's package of fiscal and monetary easing will soon warm up China's job market, as authorities pivot to stimulating the economy after months of hesitation. As one economist noted, 'the job numbers are a positive sign, but the underlying issues in the job market remain.'

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits New Record High**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached a new record high of 18.8% in August, according to official data, marking the second consecutive month of a new maximum, despite the authorities using a new statistical method. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced that the unemployment rate among people aged 16-24 living in urban areas of China increased from 17.1% in July to 18.8% in August. The NBS also published the unemployment rate for young people aged 25-29, excluding students, which stood at 6.9% in August, a 0.4 percentage point increase from July. The NBS changed its methodology in January to exclude students from the youth unemployment rate, which had reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023. The new method aims to provide more accurate employment services and formulate more effective and targeted employment policies for young people. 'The calculation of the unemployment rate by age group, excluding students, better reflects the employment and unemployment situation of young people entering society,' said the NBS. The global urban unemployment rate in China stood at 5.3% in August, slightly higher than the 5.1% recorded in July. China is under pressure to increase job creation and employment.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Reaches 18.8% in August**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached 18.8% in August, the highest level this year, as the country struggles to revitalize its ailing economy. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate among young people aged 16-24 years old, not enrolled in education, increased to 18.8% in August, up from 17.1% in July. The expected unemployment rate for June 2023 was 21.3%, but the authorities stopped publishing it and are working on revising their approach by no longer counting students. With around 12 million students graduating from Chinese universities in June 2024, the competition in the job market has increased, making it difficult for job seekers. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in May that combating youth unemployment should be a 'top priority'. The unemployment rate among those aged 25-29 years old increased from 6.5% in July to 6.9% in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The release of August's unemployment numbers comes after disappointing data on retail sales and industrial production growth, which slowed down in the same month. These indicators once again highlight the challenges Beijing faces in restarting its economy sustainably, despite efforts to do so. The National Bureau of Statistics said in a previous statement that 'the negative effects of the current changes in the external environment are intensifying, and domestic demand is still insufficient, and the economy is still facing many difficulties and challenges as it continues to recover'.

China's youth unemployment rate has reached 18.8% in August, the highest level this year, according to official data. The unemployment rate for those aged 16 to 24 who are not in school rose from 17.1% in July. The surge in youth joblessness comes as China faces significant economic headwinds, including a slowing economy and a saturated job market. Nearly 12 million university graduates entered the job market in June, exacerbating the competition for employment opportunities. President Xi Jinping has stressed the importance of addressing youth unemployment, labelling it as a 'top priority.' The latest jobless figures coincide with disappointing data on retail sales and industrial production growth for August, highlighting broader challenges in the Chinese economy.

**China's Youth Unemployment Crisis: Rising Challenges Amid Economic Slowdown**
China is facing a growing youth unemployment crisis, with the unemployment rate among individuals aged 16 to 24 reaching 18.8% in August, the highest level since December 2022. The influx of new graduates and economic deceleration are major contributing factors. Liu Aihua, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, attributed the surge in unemployment to the graduate season. The economic slowdown has exacerbated the crisis, with many young people forced to accept low-wage jobs or remain unemployed. The Chinese government's restructuring of key sectors, including technology and private education, has also had unintended consequences, such as stifling innovation and leading to layoffs. The labor market faces structural challenges, with emerging sectors like AI and green energy not creating as many jobs as traditional industries. Many Chinese youths have adopted new coping strategies, including the 'tang ping' or 'lying flat' movement, where young people reject societal pressures to achieve conventional success. The government has made job creation a top priority, but experts believe that more comprehensive reforms are needed to address the underlying structural issues.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Reaches Highest Level This Year**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached its highest level this year, reaching 18.8% in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. This is despite the government's efforts to revitalize its struggling economy. The unemployment rate among young people aged 16-24 who are not in education increased to 17.1% in July, from 16.4% in June. The expected unemployment rate in June 2023 was 21.3%, but the authorities stopped publishing it and are working on revising their approach by no longer counting students. The graduation of around 12 million students from Chinese universities in June 2024 has increased competition in the Chinese job market, making it difficult for job seekers. This explains the sharp increase in unemployment rates in July. In May, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that combating youth unemployment should be a 'top priority'. The unemployment rate among people aged 25-29 increased from 6.5% in July to 6.9% in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The release of August's unemployment figures comes after the release of disappointing data on retail sales and industrial production growth, which slowed down in the same month. These indicators once again highlight the challenges that Beijing faces in restarting its economy sustainably, despite its efforts.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Reaches New Record High in August**
According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China, the youth unemployment rate in August 2024 reached a new record high. The unemployment rate for the 16-24 age group increased from 17.1% in July to 18.8% in August. The unemployment rate for the 25-29 age group also increased from 6.5% in July to 6.9% in August. The youth unemployment rate has reached its highest level since the new calculation method was introduced in December 2023. The NBS had previously stopped releasing youth unemployment data by age group after it reached a record high of 21.3% in July 2023. The new calculation method excludes students who are still in education, including high school and university students. The summer months are a time when young graduates are preparing to enter the workforce, which is why the youth unemployment rate is often high during this period, said the NBS.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Surges to 18.8% in August**
China's youth unemployment rate has surged to 18.8% in August, its highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (ONE). This rate, which refers to registered unemployment among citizens aged 16-24, excluding university students, is more than three times higher than the overall unemployment rate, which rose to 5.3% in the eighth month of the year. The publication of youth unemployment data was suspended for most of the second half of last year after the ONE announced a revision to its calculation method to exclude the weight of university students. Before that, in June 2023, the rate reached 21.3%. Additionally, in August, inactivity among people aged 25-29, excluding those in higher education, increased by 0.4% to 6.9%, while the rate for those aged 30-59 remained stable at 3.9%. The Chinese government has announced plans to raise the retirement age for the first time since 1978, allowing men to retire at 63 and women in physically demanding and skilled jobs to retire at 58, up from 55. This change will be implemented over the next 15 years, starting from 2025.

**China's Youth Unemployment Crisis: A Complex Problem with Multiple Causes**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached a record high of 21.3% in May 2023, prompting the government to stop publishing statistics. After excluding students from the survey, the unemployment rate among young people decreased by almost a third in December. However, the problem persists, and in July 2024, the number of young unemployed people increased by a third to 17.1%. Analyst Jiayu Li notes that the official numbers do not accurately capture the situation, as they exclude millions of rural workers who face greater challenges in finding full-time employment. The government's repression of the technology, real estate, and private education sectors in 2020/21 has also contributed to the problem. The sectors have lost over $1 trillion in market value, and the private education sector, which offered part-time jobs to around 75 million students, has been decimated. Many of those affected were young workers. The government's focus on emerging sectors such as AI and electric vehicles, which do not require many new workers, has also stifled innovation and technological progress. The continuous tensions with the West have also put pressure on China's export sector, which needs to substitute high-value and low-risk orders from the West with lower-value orders from the Global South. This has an impact on employment. The rise of the 'tang ping' movement, where young people reject social pressures and opt for a more relaxed life, has also contributed to the problem. Many young people are choosing to become 'professional children or grandchildren' to care for their elderly relatives, a function in high demand due to the aging population and increasing care costs. The government's strict regulations have also made entrepreneurs and venture capitalists 'extremely cautious' and unwilling to take risks, leading to a 97% decline in new startups in the past six years. Economist Diana Choyleva notes that this is a 'serious contradiction with the government's agenda.' The high youth unemployment rate reduces productivity and will make it difficult for China to compete globally. It will also prevent young people from entering the middle class, which will have implications for consumption and social stability.
