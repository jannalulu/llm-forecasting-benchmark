**New York drought conditions fan flames, spur water saving**
New York City and surrounding areas are experiencing a severe drought, with the city urging its 8.5 million residents to save water. The drought has led to a red flag warning for bush and forest fires, with wildfires burning thousands of acres on the border between New York and New Jersey. Officials have warned that the drought conditions are creating tinderbox conditions, with high winds, low humidity, and dry conditions. New York City's water supply system is being overhauled, with the city sourcing more water from a reservoir in Catskill Park, an area particularly affected by the dry conditions. Residents are being asked to conserve water, with the city's fire department warning that an open fire hydrant can release over 1,000 gallons per minute. The drought has also led to a decrease in New York City's average daily water demand, but officials say more can be done to avoid waste. 'The reality is, the drought that we're currently experiencing is just one example of how a changing climate is impacting our state today, not far off into the future, but right now,' said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy. 'One of the attributes that is starting to come out (with climate change) is these rapid transitions from either very wet periods to very dry periods, or very dry periods to very wet periods,' said Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

**How much would snow help with drought conditions?**
Drought conditions in KELOLAND have not improved significantly despite recent rain. While snow may seem like a solution, it's not as effective as one might think. According to the 'ten-to-one rule', 10 inches of snow equates to only 1 inch of liquid water. To make a significant impact on drought conditions, snow totals would need to be much higher, as seen in the 2022-23 winter season when nearly 70 inches of snow helped alleviate a severe drought. As KELO's Scot noted, 'Let's just see how things pan out and hope for the best.'

**Return of US drought delays cattle-herd rebuilding, hurting Tyson Foods**
The return of drought in US cattle-producing areas is delaying ranchers' plans to expand production, hurting meatpackers like Tyson Foods. According to the US Drought Monitor, 62% of cattle were in drought-stricken areas at the end of October, the highest level since December 2022. Ranchers like Chad Engle in Nebraska have had to cull more of their herd than normal due to the dry conditions, and are unable to expand their herd in the face of drought. Analysts predict that the lack of pasture and high cattle prices will lead to a smaller herd size for years to come, and that beef production will be skewed towards the first half of 2025. 'Drought is the reason why the herd size has come down so much and it’s the only thing holding back ranchers from expanding the herd,' said Morningstar equity strategist Kristoffer Inton.

**The 10 Cities in the US Where the Most Snow Falls**
According to ChatGPT, the 10 cities in the United States where the most snow falls are: Syracuse (124 inches/315 cm), Rochester (99 inches/252 cm), Buffalo (94 inches/239 cm), Erie (89 inches/226 cm), Boulder (87 inches/221 cm), Flagstaff (87 inches/221 cm), Grand Rapids (75 inches/191 cm), Anchorage (74 inches/188 cm), Cleveland (68 inches/173 cm), and South Bend (66 inches/168 cm). The cities are affected by the 'lake effect' of nearby lakes, which intensifies snowstorms when cold and dry air passes over warmer lake waters. The AI predicts that the lake effect could become more pronounced in the coming years due to climate change, leading to more frequent and intense snowfall.

**Drought conditions expand locally and across the country**
The drought monitor, run by NOAA and the University of Nebraska – Lincoln, has updated its conditions, showing that drought conditions have worsened across the Buckeye State. The worst drought in Ohio is centered on the southeastern part of the state, while Northwest Ohio, particularly Fulton County, is experiencing extreme drought. The severe drought area has expanded into eastern counties. Nationally, 88% of the country is in 'abnormally dry conditions' or worse, the most since 2000. However, this is not the most expansive drought on record. The 2012 drought was more widespread, but the current one is more intense. The precipitation forecast for the next couple of weeks calls for more than normal rain, but it's unlikely to end the drought. Although the drought is not as impactful now that we're out of the growing season, winter is the 'recharge season' in our region, allowing more rain to soak into the soil.

**Nebraska voter turnout is a near record-breaker**
The 2024 general election in Nebraska saw a near-record-breaking voter turnout, with 934,188 ballots cast, according to Secretary of State Bob Evnen's Office. This represents 73.9% of registered voters, surpassing the predicted 72% turnout. The 2020 pandemic-era general election still holds the top spot with 966,920 ballots cast. Evnen praised the county election offices for ensuring a 'smooth and secure' Election Day, with 'almost all voters' prepared with voter ID. However, a few legislative races remain too close to call, with Democrats leading in some contests. The Nebraska State Board of Canvassers will convene on Dec 2 to certify election results, and a post-election audit will be conducted to verify accuracy. Final results may be delayed due to remaining early and provisional ballots, which could trigger a recount if results fall within a certain range.

**Nebraska sees strong voter turnout for 2024 General Election**
Nebraska's 2024 General Election saw a strong voter turnout, with 934,188 ballots cast, according to preliminary data. This represents a 73.9% voter turnout among registered Nebraskans. Secretary of State Bob Evnen praised county election officials and poll workers for ensuring a smooth and secure Election Day, saying, 'County election offices reported consistent voter turnout throughout Election Day with almost all voters prepared to fulfill the new voter ID requirement.' Voters who lacked acceptable ID were allowed to vote provisionally, with a deadline to present ID for their ballot to count. The election results will be officially certified on December 2 after a post-election audit and canvass of results.

**Drought Expands Across the U.S.**
Unusually dry conditions gripped over half of the contiguous United States in October 2024, with abnormal dryness and drought affecting over 78% of the population, the highest percentage in the U.S. Drought Monitor's 25-year-long record. According to the Southeast Regional Climate Center, 100 weather stations across the U.S. recorded no rain in October, and over 70 weather stations recorded the driest October on record. The rapid development of drought created a 'flash drought' in many parts of the country, typically brought on by lower-than-normal precipitation rates and abnormally high temperatures. 'Although droughts usually develop slowly, a flash drought rapidly intensifies over a few weeks to a couple of months,' said Caily Schwartz, a scientist at the Global Water Security Center. Schwartz noted that Nebraska was in severe drought in late October, with little rain and higher-than-normal temperatures. Jason Otkin, a meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said, 'This fall has been a prime example of flash drought across parts of the U.S.' Otkin's research showed that droughts have intensified more rapidly since the 1950s due to human-caused climate change, making drought monitoring and forecasting more difficult.

**US Presidential Election 2024: What to Expect on Election Night**
Approximately 240 million people will vote on November 5th to elect the next President of the United States. The candidates are Donald Trump, who is seeking to return to the White House, and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is aiming to continue Joe Biden's legacy and potentially become the first woman to hold the office. The night of the election is a crucial moment when preliminary results are expected to be released as soon as the polls close in each state. Media outlets, including the Associated Press and the National Election Pool, will be responsible for disseminating these projections, which are based on surveys of registered voters and will be conducted at polling stations, early voting locations, and by mail. Edison Research will collect the data, ensuring that the projections accurately reflect the electorate. However, it's essential to note that these figures are only estimates and do not represent the official result. The vote count will continue for several days after the election, and each state has its own process for counting votes, which means that the final results may take time to be confirmed. It's estimated that the final decision on who will be the next President will not be known until mid-December, when the electors from each state will formally cast their votes. The US electoral system is unique, with the candidate who receives the majority of votes in a state receiving all the electoral votes at stake, except in Nebraska and Maine, where a proportional system is applied. This method has led to situations where a candidate can win the presidency without receiving the majority of the national popular vote. The official result will be announced by Kamala Harris, who is not only the Vice President but also the President of the Senate, during a joint session of Congress scheduled for January 6, 2025, which will mark the beginning of the transition to the new government.

**Rio Negro may dry up by December due to below-average rainfall, warns SGB**
The Rio Negro in Manaus, Brazil is experiencing a concerning drought, with its water level dropping 32 centimeters in the last seven days to 12.18 meters on November 1. According to the Brazilian Geological Service (SGB), the river's instability is expected to continue until December, as the recent rainfall has been below average. The state of Amazonas is facing its worst drought in history, with over 800,000 people affected and economic losses of over R$ 620 million in 2024. The SGB also reported on the landslides in Porto da Terra Preta, Manacapuru, which occurred at the beginning of the month, citing 'landslides' as the main cause, according to researcher Jussara Cury. 'It was landslides', she summarized. The city of Manaus has closed the Praia da Ponta Negra due to the low water level, which has also altered the Encontro das Águas scenario.

**NOAA's Winter Outlook Leaves the Region**
NOAA's U.S. Winter Outlook for December 2024 through February 2025 predicts cooler and wetter conditions in the north and drier and warmer conditions in the south. However, for south central Nebraska and north central Kansas, the outlook is 'in the middle', with a 33.3% chance of above, below, or near normal temperatures and precipitation. Past weak La Nina winter periods suggest that the upcoming winter may favor near to slightly cooler temperatures, but precipitation trends are split. Historically, snowfall has averaged near normal during weak La Nina winters in the region. The winter ahead is likely to be one of 'normal variability' in terms of temperature and precipitation, with frequent storms and temperature swings, and potentially later snowfall. It's essential to be 'Winter-Weather Ready' by learning about winter hazards and preparing for potential impacts.

**WFP seeks additional funding for humanitarian response as drought looms in Somalia**
The World Food Programme (WFP) urgently requires 261 million US dollars to expand its humanitarian and resilience programs in Somalia, aiming to alleviate the impacts of a predicted drought through March 2025. Currently, 3.6 million Somalis are facing crisis-level hunger, projected to increase to 4.4 million by December. The WFP said, 'To avert further deterioration of food security and nutrition outcomes across the country, sustained humanitarian assistance, including anticipatory action, is urgently needed.' The appeal follows findings from the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, which highlights that 1.6 million children under the age of five are at risk of acute malnutrition until July 2025. The WFP noted a 14 percent increase in global acute malnutrition and a 21 percent increase in severe acute malnutrition compared to the same season last year. The IPC report aligns with global forecasts indicating an 80 percent probability of La Nina conditions, which could lead to drought in Somalia. The WFP said, 'This is due to anticipated below-average rains, localized flooding in the riverine and urban areas of Hiran, Gedo, Middle Shabelle, and Lower Shabelle, ongoing conflict, high food prices, and diseases contributing to acute food insecurity and malnutrition.'

**No improvement for ongoing drought in Omaha**
According to the Thursday drought monitor update, conditions in the Omaha area have not improved, with severe drought remaining across a majority of the area. Moderate drought has increased, with areas under abnormal dryness to the southeast. The entire state of Iowa is now experiencing abnormally dry conditions or worse, and a majority of Nebraska is experiencing some level of dry conditions or drought. The reason for this is the fact that the Omaha area has been incredibly dry recently, with a deficit of 1″ for the year, 4.5″ below average for the season of fall, and nearly 1.75″ in deficit for the month of October. The Omaha area is on track to see the driest September and October on record, with only 0.25″ of rain recorded for both months combined.

**U.S. winter wheat drought expected to worsen**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts that drought conditions will persist or worsen in the winter wheat growing regions of the United States this winter. A slowly developing La Nina is expected to influence U.S. weather patterns, leading to drier-than-average conditions in the south, including large portions of the key winter wheat producing area. NOAA expects drought conditions to 'persist and worsen' across the central and southern U.S. Plains. Brian Pugh, operation drought lead with NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, stated, 'Unfortunately, after a brief period in the spring of 2024 with minimal drought conditions across the country, more than a quarter of the land mass in the continental U.S. is currently in at least a moderate drought.' Justin Gilpin, chief executive officer of Kansas Wheat, said, 'When you see a forecast like that, it's certainly concerning.' He added that growers in Kansas, eastern Colorado, and Nebraska have been 'dusting in' their wheat in hopes of receiving some winter precipitation. However, emergence has been poor, and crops that were planted in September have been going backward.

**Pie charts Showcase the High-Speed Progress of Nebraska Harvests**
According to the USDA's Crop Progress report, Nebraska's corn and soybean harvests are progressing faster than normal as of October 21. The corn harvest is 63% complete, 18 percentage points ahead of the five-year average, while the soybean harvest is 85% complete, five percentage points ahead of the five-year average. Agronomy Service Representative Travis Gustafson noted that many farmers in the state have already completed harvest, with yields holding steady under irrigation at 260 to 280 bushels per acre for corn. However, soybean yields have been more varied, with Gustafson stating that 'soybean yields in Nebraska were strong but they dropped off as the beans got dry.' The dry weather has led to drought stress affecting 100% of the state, with 82.8% experiencing at least moderate drought.

**Drought conditions in Nebraska expected to last through the winter**
Nebraska is experiencing severe drought conditions, with 83% of the state facing drought and 48% in severe drought. According to the National Drought Mitigation Center, the drought is expected to last through the winter, with relief not predicted until February 2025. Brian Fuchs, a geoscientist with the center, said, 'We either are very wet or very dry, and right now we’re very dry.' Brad Pugh of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) noted that there may be some short-term improvement in late October and early November, but 'for anything meaningful, you’re really going to have to wait until next spring.' Fuchs emphasized the importance of being aware of water usage, saying, 'We’re seeing drought continue to develop and worsen, and it looks like it will be that way for a while. So we should be prepared for that.'

**Drought in Southern Africa: Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Public Health Situation Analysis (PHSA) (14 October 2024) - Angola**
The 2024 El Niño event has caused widespread drought conditions in southern Africa, affecting countries such as Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The drought has led to severe food shortages, limited access to clean water, disease outbreaks, and loss of livestock. According to FEWS NET estimates, nearly 23 million people are facing high levels of food insecurity, with Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique being the most affected. It is estimated that between 14.0 and 14.9 million people will need urgent humanitarian assistance during the lean season from October to December 2024. The drought has also led to the displacement of thousands of people, disease outbreaks, and significant impacts on agriculture. The situation is further complicated by the ongoing cholera epidemic and the emerging risk of mpox, which may divert resources and response efforts away from the drought response in some affected countries. 'The situation has relatively stabilized', but water shortages are undermining hygiene and sanitation efforts, and the risk of cholera outbreaks remains in countries such as Malawi and Mozambique. The drought may also increase the risk of HIV and AIDS transmission, mental health issues, and gender-based violence, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced preparedness and response mechanisms.

**NE pandemic-related homeowner aid program wraps up, as rent aid program seeks applicants**
A pandemic-related program in Nebraska, the Nebraska Homeowner Assistance Fund, has wrapped up, providing $50 million in aid to 3,094 applicants, with an average of $14,834 per recipient. The program aimed to prevent Nebraskans from losing their homes due to COVID-19 hardships. Meanwhile, a separate program, the Nebraska Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA II), still has available funds to help eligible renters. To date, over $20 million has been obligated, providing financial assistance to thousands of qualified Nebraskans for past-due and future rent payments and past-due utility and internet payments. NIFA officials said they hope to get at least 75% of the $48 million spent by the end of 2024. Once 75% of the funds are obligated, remaining funds will be directed toward the development of affordable housing. 'These are hard-working Nebraskans going through a tough time, and without the burden of past-due rent, they've been able to take care of medical bills, get their cars fixed or get caught up on childcare bills,' said Andy Marsh, owner of Keystone Properties. 'In turn, landlords like myself are getting caught up. It's been a snowball effect for our economy.'

**Strain on Nebraska behavioral health system could worsen; need remains high**
A 2024 study found that nearly 26% of Nebraskans reported having a mental health illness in the past year, 3% higher than the national average. Despite this, the state's behavioral health care system is facing budget cuts, with $15 million cut from the budget in the last legislative session and more cuts expected. Providers and stakeholders are concerned that these cuts will worsen the strain on the system, which already has a shortage of behavioral health providers, with 88 of 93 counties having a shortage in 2023. Tiffany Gressley, regional administrator for Region 3 Behavioral Health Services, said, 'We're being fiscally conservative by serving these people early; as early as we can. We're saving money and we're saving, on top of that, the human cost that goes along with untreated mental health conditions.' However, budget cuts mean fewer Nebraskans will receive services, and advocates warn that further cuts will only exacerbate the problem.

**Amazonas Drought Affects Over 767,000 People, Government Implements Humanitarian Assistance**
The severe drought affecting the Amazon region in 2024 has impacted over 767,000 people in the state of Amazonas, according to the Civil Defense. Approximately 190,000 families are struggling due to the dry spell, which has affected both daily life and the local economy. The main rivers in the region, such as the Rio Negro, are at critical levels. In Manaus, the Ponta Negra beach has been closed, and river transportation has been disrupted by the formation of sandbanks. Ribeirinho communities, like Getúlio de Castro, are reporting difficulties with navigation and transportation by canoe, as well as increased fuel costs. The Felipe Lopes shipyard has also been severely affected, with a decrease in demand and the need for layoffs. The regional gastronomy sector is also suffering losses, according to information from Portal G1. In other cities in Amazonas, the situation is equally concerning. Tabatinga is experiencing its worst drought in history, with the Rio Solimões at -1.99 meters. Cities like Coari, Parintins, and Itacoatiara are also recording very low levels in the Rio Amazonas, compromising navigation and commerce. In Itacoatiara, the operation of the floating port, essential for the transportation of goods, has also been disrupted. To mitigate the effects of the drought, the government has been implementing humanitarian assistance actions, including the distribution of food and water purifiers. Medicines, oxygen cylinders, and oxygen generators have also been sent to affected areas. According to experts, the drought is the result of a combination of climatic factors. Renato Senna, a researcher at the National Institute of Amazonian Research (Inpa), explains that the El Niño phenomenon, combined with the warming of the North Atlantic Tropical, altered atmospheric circulation, making it difficult to form clouds and reducing rainfall in the region, as he said, 'The combination of these factors has led to a severe drought in the Amazon region.'

**"Severe drought" hits highest level in Colorado since February**
As fall begins in Colorado, over 43% of the state is experiencing 'abnormally dry' or worse conditions, affecting around 3.1 million people. This is a slight decrease from 47% three months ago, but a higher percentage than the same time last year, when 34% of the state was affected. The portion of the state experiencing 'severe drought' has reached its highest level since February, with 3.71% of the state under these conditions, including Denver county and parts of the Denver metro area. If a National Weather Service forecast holds true, drought conditions are likely to worsen heading into winter, with October through December predicted to be hotter and drier than normal.

**Over 1 million Ugandans at risk from torrential rains**
Uganda is warning that over 1 million people could be affected by torrential rains, which are causing landslides, flooding, and displacement. According to Lilian Aber, minister of state for relief, disaster preparedness and refugees, the country is experiencing heavy rains, strong winds, and hailstorms, leading to widespread waterlogging, flooding, and crop destruction. So far, 25,990 people from 6,650 families have been displaced in the western districts of Ntoroko and Kasese, and 2,010 people in the Mount Elgon region have been displaced due to the threat of landslides. Aber stated, 'The likelihood of more destructive landslides, floods and wind/hailstorms occurring between September and December is very high.' She urged local governments to conduct community sensitization campaigns and warned that the number of people affected will likely exceed 1 million nationwide by December 2024. 'These victims will require relief in the form of food, tents, medicine, and other non-food supplies,' Aber added.

**Somalia Key Message Update: PAfter disrupted gu production season, below-average deyr rainfall is likely, August 2024**
Widespread Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to persist through at least January 2025 in Somalia. Despite three consecutive seasons of average to above-average rainfall supporting gradual recovery among households badly impacted by the 2020-2022 drought, high food assistance needs persist due to ongoing conflict, severe flooding, high food prices, and limited income-earning opportunities. Humanitarian partners provided food assistance to an average of less than 1.3 million people monthly from June to August 2024, but this assistance covered only approximately 35-40 percent of FEWS NET's estimated population in need of food aid. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in settlements have minimal income-generating opportunities, limited access to food, and depleted coping capacity, with decreasing humanitarian assistance. All settlements hosting displaced populations are expected to face either Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes. The below-average deyr rainfall forecast for the upcoming October to December season is likely to contribute to a fourth consecutive season of below-average crop production, exacerbating food insecurity. Revised analysis indicates that the crop-dependent Sorghum High Potential and Bay Bakool Low Potential livelihood zones are expected to deteriorate to Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with most other agropastoral areas expected to continue facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. In northern and central pastoral areas, improved rangeland conditions, higher livestock birth rates, and increased milk production due to above-average gu rainfall are expected to improve food security for poor households through December. However, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to persist in the Addun and Coastal Deeh Pastoral livelihood zones of the central regions, which were badly impacted during the 2020-2022 drought.

**La Niña: Anticipatory Action and Response Plan, September–December 2024 - Mitigating the expected impacts of La Niña‑induced climate extremes on agriculture and food security**
The 2023-2024 El Niño event significantly impacted over 60 million people globally, causing devastating droughts, heatwaves, and floods. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) initiated anticipatory actions in 24 at-risk countries, followed by emergency response efforts in some of the hardest-hit areas. With the current El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) neutral state, La Niña is anticipated to develop between September and November, with probabilities ranging from 55 to 71 percent, and is expected to persist through January to March 2025. La Niña can increase the likelihood of extreme weather and climate hazards such as droughts, floods, excessive rainfall, and cyclones, which can have severe consequences on food security, particularly for the 282 million people already facing acute food insecurity worldwide. FAO's La Niña Anticipatory Action and Response Plan requires USD 318 million to deliver immediate support to the most at-risk and affected populations, reaching approximately 10.5 million people through the end of 2024. The Plan aims to protect vulnerable people from La Niña-induced disaster impacts, capitalize on the positive spillover effects of La Niña, and deliver early response where La Niña causes devastation.

**Drought conditions expand in Lincoln and statewide, but relief could be on the way**
Drought conditions in Nebraska have worsened, with nearly 35% of the state now in at least a moderate drought, including nearly 9% in severe drought. In Lancaster County, the portion of the area in moderate drought more than doubled in one week, going from 37% to 76%, and the drought area now includes Lincoln. However, relief could be on the way as the National Weather Service is forecasting 2-3 inches of rain for Lincoln and many other parts of Southeast Nebraska from late Friday night into Monday morning. The weather service said, 'Our stretch of dry weather is nearing its end, rain will be nearly universal this weekend across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.' The rain this weekend will also usher in much cooler temperatures, with Sunday's high forecast to only reach 63, followed by temperatures in the upper 60s to upper 70s Monday through Thursday.
