**Lara Trump For Senate? More GOP Lawmakers Want Trump's Daughter-In-Law To Take Rubio's Seat**
A growing coalition of President-elect Donald Trump's allies are backing his daughter-in-law Lara Trump to replace Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., if he's confirmed as Secretary of State. Lara Trump expressed her interest in the role, saying, 'If I were tapped for this, serving my home state now of Florida, it's a great honor and a great responsibility.' If Rubio is confirmed, DeSantis would be responsible for selecting his replacement until the 2026 election, when voters would choose who serves out the remainder of Rubio's term through 2028. Lara Trump, who is married to Eric Trump, was elected RNC co-chair in March and has a bolstered political profile due to Republicans' success in the 2024 election.

**Lara Trump Appointed as Right-Hand Woman in White House**
Lara Trump, the daughter-in-law of former US President Donald Trump, has been appointed as the right-hand woman in the White House. She has been a strong supporter of her father-in-law, leading a 'Women's Empowerment Tour' and traveling across the US with a group of women dressed in red to win over conservative women's votes. Lara was appointed as the co-chair of the Republican Party (RDC) in March, a move seen as a deliberate choice by Trump to reorient the party apparatus in his favor. According to Business Insider, Lara was nominated to replace Marco Rubio in the Senate after he was appointed to Trump's cabinet. Lara's career has not always been focused on politics, having studied communications in college, worked as a personal trainer, bartender, and waitress, and later becoming a pastry chef in New York. She also worked as a producer on CBS and a host on Fox News before returning to politics in 2024.

Lara Trump, the wife of Eric Trump, is a candidate for a advisory position, having been appointed co-chair of the Republican Party in March. Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of Trump, may also receive an official position in the White House, although this is uncertain. Elon Musk, who supported Trump's campaign with $119 million, has expressed interest in a advisory position, and has promised to reduce bureaucracy and save up to $2 billion in the US budget.

**Susan Wiles Appointed as White House Chief of Staff**
US President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Susan Wiles, his former campaign manager, as the White House Chief of Staff. Wiles is the first woman to hold this position. Trump is expected to make further personnel announcements in the coming days. Meanwhile, in Washington, there is a sense of calm, as President Joe Biden spends the weekend at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Wiles, a 67-year-old Republican strategist, has been a key advisor to Trump and is known for her loyalty and discretion. Trump described her as 'hard, smart, and innovative, and admired and respected by all.' Wiles has been active in politics for decades and has worked for various Republican politicians. She is expected to take office on January 20, when Trump is sworn in. The appointment of Wiles has raised questions about the future of the Supreme Court, with some speculating that Biden may try to appoint a new justice before he leaves office. The court has been shifted to the right under Trump, with only three liberal justices remaining. Biden has already appointed one justice, but the majority remains unchanged. The fate of liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is 70, is uncertain, and some speculate that Biden may try to appoint a new justice if she retires. However, this would require strategic maneuvering by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been relatively quiet since Trump's victory, with no public appearances scheduled. The outcome of the election is still unclear, with the results of the presidential election still being counted and certified in the states. The official results must be finalized by December 11, and the Electoral College will meet on December 17 to cast their votes. The new Congress will convene on January 3, and the Electoral College will meet again on January 6 to formally confirm the results. Trump will be inaugurated on January 20 in a ceremonial ceremony at the Capitol, and the new government will take office immediately after.

**Trump Makes First Appointments to Future Administration**
Donald Trump has made his first appointments to his future administration. Susan Wiles, 67, will be the head of the White House staff, making her the first woman in American history to hold such a position. Wiles has been working with Trump since 2016 and was the head of his election campaign in 2020. Trump praised Wiles, saying, 'Suzie Wiles helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history, and she was a key part of both of my successful campaigns in 2016 and 2020. Suzie is tough, smart, inventive, and everyone admires and respects her.' Trump has 75 days before his inauguration on January 20, 2025, to form his team. The transition period will be filled with selecting key personnel, mid-level officials, and forming a 'bench' for various emergencies. According to the Associated Press, there are approximately 4,000 government vacancies that need to be filled, with around 1,200 requiring congressional approval. It is expected that the new administration will not face significant opposition from Congress, given the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has already appointed Susan Wiles as the head of the White House staff. Other potential appointments include Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump's husband, who played a key role in the Abraham Accords, a historic agreement between Israel and Arab countries. Richard Grenell, a former US ambassador to Germany, is also being considered for a key position. Other potential candidates include Kash Patel, who has promised to 'come after' journalists who have criticized Trump, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump has hinted at appointing. Trump has also mentioned considering Elon Musk for a new position, which would focus on increasing the efficiency of government officials and reducing federal agency spending by at least $2 trillion.

**Suzie Waiels: The 'Snowflake' Who May Become Trump's White House Chief of Staff**
Suzie Waiels, the co-chair of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, was one of the people thanked by Trump when he took the stage early on Wednesday, just hours before his official victory in the 2024 US presidential election. Trump said in his victory speech: 'Suzie loves to stay in the background... Let me tell you, we call her 'Snowflake'... She loves to stay in the background, but she's never there.' According to The Hill, Waiels usually stays in the background, but she appeared last week with a post on social media platform X, her first post in nearly two years, defending Trump against comments made by billionaire Mark Cuban that the former president is usually surrounded by 'strong and smart women.' Waiels wrote in her first post on the platform since February 2023: 'I learned that Mark Cuban needs help identifying strong and smart women surrounding President Trump. Well, here we are... I'm proud to lead this campaign,' also mentioning the efforts of Linda McMahon, Trump's transition policy chief, and Lara Trump, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Waiels currently serves as the co-chair of Trump's campaign alongside Chris LaCivita, and there are speculations that she may become the White House Chief of Staff in the new Republican administration. Politico previously described her as Trump's most important advisor, and she has worked in politics for several decades, working with presidents, mayors, governors, and members of Congress, including Senator Rick Scott of Florida and Governor Ron DeSantis. She also worked with Trump in his 2016 and 2024 campaigns, and according to Reuters, she worked as a deputy director during Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign and later became responsible for scheduling his office, and also worked as a consultant in Florida.

**Trump's New Power Center: The Family Members and Advisors Who Will Shape His Presidency**
Lara Trump, the wife of Eric Trump and current co-chair of the Republican Committee, took the most privileged spot at Trump's victory night, likely due to her efforts in mobilizing the vote since the start of early voting. This informal but influential position was previously held by Jarred Kushner, husband of Ivanka Trump, during Trump's first presidency. Other key figures in the new environment include Susi Wiles and Chris LaCivita, masterminds behind Trump's campaign. Wiles is a top contender for the position of White House Chief of Staff, the most important role in the White House after the President. Linda McMahon, a wrestling magnate, and Howard Lutnick, president of investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald, will be instrumental in shaping Trump's future cabinet until January 20, the day of his inauguration.
