**Bureaucrats Worry About Trump's Plan to Destroy Administrative State**
Federal bureaucrats are worried that President-elect Donald Trump will follow through on his promise to purge the government of rogue and corrupt actors within the administrative state. Trump's plan to reclassify federal government employees into Schedule F would allow the president to enhance accountability and job performance within bureaucratic agencies. However, some bureaucrats are concerned that this would lead to an 'exodus' of employees who want to do their jobs according to law and regulation, rather than being political appointees. Republicans believe that Democrats use nonpartisan agencies to push their agenda, while Progressives argue that making legislative redistricting decisions non-political would prevent voters from having a say in the matter. A current Biden administration appointee stated that 'you want people to challenge your thinking' and 'do the kind of research that will get you the best possible current information on a topic,' rather than being dismissed for not being 'unbiased.' President Joe Biden canceled Trump's executive order in 2021, but with Trump's victory, he could reimplement the order and purge the unelected technocrats artificially running the federal government.

**Biden Administration's Last-Ditch Effort to Undermine Trump**
The Biden administration is using its remaining time in office to undermine the incoming Trump administration. The latest move is to provide Ukraine with the right to use ATACMS missiles to strike deep into Russia. This is seen as a challenge to Trump's plans for peace talks with Russia, which are expected to begin soon. The Biden administration is also planning to transfer $7 billion to Ukraine as soon as possible. While Trump has not yet been formally inaugurated, the Biden administration is using its remaining powers to cause problems for the incoming administration. This includes appointing new ambassadors, judges, and other officials, as well as issuing presidential decrees and pardons. The Biden administration is also using the media to discredit Trump's nominees and policies. The article notes that the Biden administration's actions are a violation of the tradition of a smooth transition of power, and that they are using their remaining time in office to cause problems for the incoming administration. The article also notes that the Trump administration may face challenges in implementing its policies, including the possibility of a delay in the transfer of power on January 20.

**Can Joe Biden save the executive branch from Trump's restructuring? Here's what Democrats are demanding from him**
As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, Democrats are urging President Joe Biden to act swiftly to protect the integrity of the executive branch. With only weeks left in Biden's administration, Democrats are looking to him to use executive actions to safeguard their policy victories and prevent Trump from dismantling critical government structures. Lawmakers like Rep. Jared Huffman emphasize that the Biden administration must anticipate these threats and act accordingly. Biden has limited time, but several strategies could help him prevent Trump from rolling back key policies, including executive orders, last-minute regulations, and reinforcing protections for federal workers. Democrats also urge Biden to secure military and Ukraine aid, seat federal judges, and safeguard federal lands from oil, gas, and mining development.

**Catholics urge US President Biden to commute federal death row - Vatican News**
The Catholic Mobilizing Network (CMN) is urging US President Joe Biden to commute the federal death row, where 40 men are currently serving a death sentence. CMN Executive Director Krisanne Vaillancourt Murphy said, 'We're in a time-sensitive and urgent moment because the president has constitutional authority and power to take action to commute the federal death row.' President Biden has a unique opportunity to embrace Catholic teaching and save the lives of those 40 men, according to Murphy. The Catholic Church teaches that the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person, as stated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Murphy noted that President Biden's last month in office will overlap with the start of the 2025 Jubilee of Hope, a Holy Year that emphasizes a time to rebalance and recommit to justice and mercy. Pope Francis launched a special call for the abolition of the death penalty in the Bull of Indiction of the 2025 Jubilee, writing, 'In every part of the world, believers, should be one in demanding dignified conditions for those in prison, respect for their human rights, and above all the abolition of the death penalty.' Murphy highlighted that if President Biden were to take this step, it would have reverberations not only in the United States but around the globe.

**Biden Extends US National Emergency with Iran for Another Year**
US President Joe Biden announced that the national emergency with Iran will be extended for another year. Biden stated, 'Our relations with Iran have not been normalized yet, and the implementation of the agreements with Iran dated January 19, 1981, is still ongoing. Therefore, I have decided that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170 regarding Iran.' According to the National Emergency Act, the national emergency will automatically expire unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and submits it to Congress within 90 days, as stated on the White House website. Biden continued, 'I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the notice attached, which states that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170, regarding Iran, which was declared on November 14, 1979, will continue in effect beyond November 14, 2024.'

**Marc Elias: Fed judge rejects GOP state officials attempt to block Biden's voting access EO**
A federal judge rejected a request by Republican state officials, led by Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft and Arkansas Secretary of State John Thurston, to block President Joe Biden's executive order expanding voting access. The order, signed in March 2021, aimed to promote voter registration, increase access to accurate election information, and decrease barriers to voting at the state level. The GOP plaintiffs argued that the order violates state sovereignty and usurps Congress' powers in regulating federal elections, but the judge's decision upheld the order as constitutional.

**Biden administration nears completion of second cybersecurity executive order with plethora of agenda items**
The White House is close to finalizing a second executive order on cybersecurity, which covers a wide range of subjects including artificial intelligence, secure software, cloud security, identity credentialing, and post-quantum cryptography. The order is 95% complete and aims to be signed by President Joe Biden in early December, although some sources view it as 'pretty aspirational' given the president's impending departure. The order includes pilot programs for accelerating next-gen cyber defense AI models, transparency and deployment of secure software, and modernizing federal identity credentialing and access management. Cyber experts have differing views on the order's potential impact, with some questioning the value of additional tasks without funding guarantees and others seeing opportunities for AI to make a big difference in cybersecurity.

**'Biden Bucks' Could Change Elections Forever**
The Biden-Harris administration's Executive Order 14019 has been criticized as 'Biden Bucks' for its potential to alter the election process and favor Democrats. The order directs government agencies to promote voter registration and turnout, but critics argue that the implementation has been biased. Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for The Oversight Project, stated, 'If you target it neutrally, probably not the worst thing in the world. We want civic engagement in the country.' However, Brosnan also noted that the plans submitted by government agencies to promote voter registration have been largely shielded from the public, and that some agencies have partnered with liberal NGOs that push radical ideas such as noncitizen voting and felon voting. Brosnan said, 'They're actually implementing this executive order and putting their thumb on the scale for the federal government to support one candidate over another and juice turnout again.' The potential impact of 'Biden Bucks' on the 2024 presidential election could be significant, especially in Arizona and Michigan, where numerous infirmities in the U.S. election system could dramatically affect the election results.

**‘Biden Bucks’ Could Change Elections Forever**
The Biden-Harris administration has implemented an executive order, Executive Order 14019, to increase federal involvement in American elections by registering voters and turning out the vote. Critics have dubbed this 'Biden Bucks', suggesting it is a plan to maintain Democratic power. Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for The Oversight Project at The Heritage Foundation, stated, 'If you target it neutrally, probably not the worst thing in the world. We want civic engagement in the country.' However, the implementation has been criticized for being anything but neutral. The article also touches on the globalists' goal of controlling protein sources, specifically targeting beef as the environmental boogeyman, and promoting lab-grown meat or vegetable-based proteins instead.

**Darklore Depository 2024: A Halloween Inventory Of Federal Agency Guidance Documents**
The U.S. Code archives federal laws, while the 186,000-page Code of Federal Regulations contains rules from the daily Federal Register. The Register has reached 86,712 pages, the third-highest annual count of all time, with two months yet to go. Federal agency guidance documents, including statements of policy, memoranda, and notices, are not reliably cataloged and archived. Since 2020, an informal inventory of these documents has been compiled, with the latest spreadsheet unearthing 108,023. Donald Trump's Executive Order 13,891 required public disclosure on agency website portals, but Joe Biden revoked it. The House passed the 'Guidance Out of Darkness (GOOD) Act' to codify similar disclosure portals. Some agencies continue to report guidance, while others have frozen their counts. Many agencies have 'tombstone' landing pages that refer to the now-inoperative Trump E.O. 13,891. Despite decay, some agencies prominently report guidance in 2024, four years out from Trump's directive. Examples include Commerce Department divisions, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Some agencies archive even rescinded, superseded, or inactive guidance, rather than deleting or obscuring it. However, many agencies present no tractable guidance, and the actual quantity of guidance is often indeterminate. The dispensation of federal dollars is an increasingly powerful regulatory mechanism, and the stipulations embedded within grant programs and Notices of Funding Opportunity belong in any compilation of regulatory dark matter.

**Missouri attempts to halt Biden’s voter registration executive order**
The state of Missouri is attempting to overturn a 2021 executive order signed by President Joe Biden that aimed to educate voters about how to register to vote. Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft argued that the order is a federal overreach and that the state already has an election system in place. However, an attorney representing the U.S. Department of Justice stated that the state has failed to present any evidence that the executive order has caused harm. The state's attorney claimed that the order will lead to an added burden for the state by verifying voter registration information shared through federal channels. The case has been taken under advisement by the judge, and it's unclear when a ruling will be issued.

**US Supreme Court Rejects Republican Challenge to Biden's Voter Registration Order**
The US Supreme Court has rejected a Republican challenge to President Joe Biden's executive order increasing government involvement in voter registration and mobilization. The court denied the petition in the case of Keefer v. Biden without comment, with no dissenting judges. The order requires all federal agencies, including the prison system, to help increase voter registration and participation and promote mail-in voting. Critics say it will likely benefit Democrats more than Republicans. The main petitioner is Pennsylvania state Representative Dawn Keefer, a Republican. The 27 Republican state legislators from Pennsylvania challenged Biden's Executive Order 14019 of March 7, 2021, which requires all federal agencies to help increase voter registration and participation. They argued that the order was unconstitutional and that voter registration campaigns are not a legitimate function of government. They also challenged a voter registration order issued by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat. The legislators argued in their lawsuit that the executive actions violated their constitutional rights by usurping their power to prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections. Judge Jennifer Wilson of the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissed the lawsuit on March 26. 'The legislators were not legitimate to challenge an action that supposedly harmed the legislative assembly as a whole,' she wrote. 'They only alleged an institutional harm derived from a general loss of legislative power.' 'A vague and general allegation that elections, in general, will be undermined, is not the type of case or controversy that this court can pronounce on under Article III [of the US Constitution].' The legislators told the Supreme Court that they wanted an expedited consideration of the issue of standing, so if they prevail, 'they may obtain a preliminary injunction in the district court much before the November 2024 elections.'

**Supreme Court won’t hear challenge to Biden voter registration order**
The Supreme Court has declined to hear a challenge from Pennsylvania Republican lawmakers to a Biden administration executive order aimed at boosting voter registration. The order, signed in March 2021, allows nonpartisan third-party organizations to provide voter registration services on federal agency premises. The lawmakers claimed the order was unconstitutional and an attempt to influence the 2020 election. However, Chief Justice John Roberts previously addressed a similar argument in a 2023 decision, ruling that state legislatures are not insulated from state judicial review. The denial of the challenge is a blow to groups seeking more transparency behind the executive order's functions, including America First Legal, which has called the order an 'unprecedented election interference program'.

However, Chief Justice John Roberts previously addressed a similar argument in the 2023 case of Moore v.

President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled a new executive order to combat 3D-printed and converted firearms, and improve active shooter drills in schools. The order sets up a new federal task force to assess the threat posed by machine gun conversion devices, which can be 3D-printed for less than 40 cents in under 30 minutes. Biden said, 'Enough,' vowing to keep fighting against gun violence even after he leaves office. Harris noted that more children are now killed by guns than any other cause, including car accidents or cancer, and said, 'I believe the right to be safe is a civil right.' The order also directs federal agencies to develop information for U.S. schools on how to create, implement, and evaluate evidence-informed active shooter drills. Homicides have dropped 17% since the creation of an office on gun violence prevention, and mass shootings were down 20% in 2024 compared to a year earlier.

**Biden Signs Bill to Continue US Government Funding Until December 20**
US President Joe Biden signed a bill to continue funding the US government until December 20. According to the White House press release, 'on Thursday, September 26, 2024, the President signed the bill' which provides 'appropriations for projects and activities of executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government through December 20, 2024'. The Senate and House of Representatives previously approved the document on Wednesday. The Biden administration had previously stated that it is necessary to extend the funding of the US government until December 20 and urges both chambers of Congress to pass the corresponding bill as soon as possible. This would prevent a costly and unnecessary shutdown of government funding and give time to pass the 2025 budget later this year, as stated in the administration's statement.

**Biden Takes Aim at 3D-Printed Firearms, Machine-Gun Conversion Devices in Executive Order**
President Joe Biden's administration has released a new executive order aimed at reducing gun violence, targeting machine-gun conversion devices and 3D-printed firearms, as well as improving active-shooter drills in schools. The order comes after a mass shooting in Birmingham, Ala., where local law enforcement believe the shooters used conversion devices. Biden will direct a task force to assess the threat these weapons pose and the federal agencies' operational and legal capacities to detect and seize them. The order also sets out to improve school-based active-shooter drills by keeping guns away from potential school shooters and investing more federal resources in school safety and gun-violence prevention. According to the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, there has been a 17-percent drop in the national homicide rate between January and June, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the Gun Violence Archive reported that the number of mass shootings so far in 2024 has dropped by 20 percent. Biden said, 'The Biden-Harris administration's latest effort to crack down on gun violence.'

Harris believes the right to be safe is a civil right and that means a right to live free from gun violence. The order aims to curb violence, help communities recover from trauma, and coordinate the federal response. According to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today, there have been at least 31 mass killings in the U.S. so far in 2024, leaving at least 135 people dead. Gun-control groups praised the order, but the NRA criticized it as 'just one more attempt by the Biden-Harris Administration to deflect attention from their soft-on-crime policies.'
