**Ford Europe to Lay Off 4,000 Employees Amid Electric Vehicle Crisis**
Ford Europe plans to lay off 4,000 employees by the end of 2027, citing the need to create a more competitive structure in terms of costs and ensure long-term sustainability and growth of its business in Europe. The layoffs will primarily affect Germany, where around 2,900 people will be let go, while 800 employees will be affected in the UK and 300 in the rest of the continent. Ford is particularly concerned about the passenger car business, which has suffered significant losses in recent years, and the transition to electric vehicles and new competition has been 'disruptive'. The company is also considering bringing back thermal and hybrid vehicles that could help revive the European division. 'We need a clear and unequivocal political agenda to promote electric mobility,' said John Lawler, Ford's financial director, in a letter to the German government. 'We lack investments in charging infrastructure, significant incentives to help consumers switch to electric vehicles, and more flexibility in meeting CO2 emission targets.' However, the company acknowledges that the lack of government support and economic incentives for electric vehicles has contributed to the crisis. 'The market is only growing when supported by generous incentives, often incompatible with state finances and the principle of subsidies,' said Lawler. 'These incentives end up helping wealthy car owners buy premium vehicles, such as Teslas.'

**4000 job cuts! US-based auto giant plans massive layoffs by 2027 - EVs behind this decision?**
Ford, a US-based automaker, plans to lay off 14% of its European workforce, approximately 4,000 jobs, by the end of 2027 due to mounting losses and weak sales of electric vehicles. The job cuts will primarily be in Germany and the United Kingdom. According to Ford Europe vice president Peter Godsell, the company is experiencing 'weaker demand for electric vehicles than we had previously forecast and we continue to have challenges around our operating costs... so we need decisive action to restructure our business.' Ford's European sales dropped 17.9% through September this year, significantly more than the 6.1% loss in the industry as a whole. The company has called on the German government to provide more incentives and better charging infrastructure to help consumers transition to EVs, as EV sales in Germany fell 28.6% in the first nine months of this year.

**Ford's Electric Vehicle Push Falters, 4000 Employees to be Laid Off**
Ford is facing a crisis after a failed attempt to transition to electric vehicles. As a result, 4000 employees in Germany and the UK will be laid off, just a month before Christmas. This is the second major layoff for Ford in a short period, following a reduction of 3800 employees in February 2023. Ford's sales have plummeted by 18% in Europe so far this year. The company is now calling for government assistance to help sell their electric vehicles. 'What we lack in Europe and Germany is a clear, unmistakable political agenda to promote e-mobility, such as public investments in charging infrastructure, meaningful incentives, and greater flexibility in meeting CO2 targets,' wrote Ford's CFO John Lawler in a letter to the German government, as reported by Reuters.

**Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy Plan to Bring Back Federal Employees to the Office**
Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), plan to bring back federal employees who have been working remotely since the pandemic to the office five days a week. According to Ramaswamy, 'we will not even mention mass layoffs, we will just tell them they need to come back to the office five days a week from 8am to 6pm.' Ramaswamy believes that currently, employees 'do not go to work' and that he and Musk will use 'the air hammer and the electric saw' to 'clean up the bureaucracy' and save the billions that Trump needs but that, according to estimates by several economists, are impossible to recover. The plan is to force employees to return to the office, which will likely lead to a significant number of them quitting. Currently, two-thirds of the 2.2 million federal employees work remotely, but only 10% can do so full-time, while the rest must go to the office at least five days every two weeks. This policy was decided by Joe Biden in August 2023 to start bringing federal employees back to their pre-pandemic routines. Musk has been known for his anti-remote work stance, calling it 'morally wrong' and showing signs of intransigence at Tesla and X, formerly Twitter. However, this approach may not work for federal employees.

**General Motors Lays Off 1,000 Workers Amid Electric Vehicle Losses**
General Motors (GM) is laying off around 1,000 workers worldwide, mostly in the US, in an effort to rationalize its operations, according to a source who spoke to Reuters on Friday. GM confirmed in a statement that it had reduced staff, but did not specify the number. 'To win in this competitive market, we have to optimize speed and excellence', said the Detroit-based automaker. 'As part of this ongoing effort, we have made a small number of team reductions', it added. GM has been trying to reposition itself as a leader in electric vehicles and software, both of which are costly. The automaker aims to reduce between $2 billion and $4 billion in losses on electric vehicles next year. According to a state notice, the cuts include 507 employees at GM's Warren (Michigan) technology center. In August, GM laid off over 1,000 software department workers to rationalize the team. In September, GM also laid off around 1,700 workers at a Kansas manufacturing plant. One of its most significant reductions occurred in 2023, when around 5,000 GM salaried workers took early retirement. Cost-cutting efforts have intensified across all Detroit automakers and the global industry, as companies compete to make electric vehicles profitable and compete with Tesla and powerful Chinese automakers. Stellantis has laid off thousands of salaried and hourly workers this year, including 2,450 workers at a Michigan plant in August and 1,100 workers at an Ohio plant earlier this month. Ford Motor reduced shifts at its Michigan F-150 Lightning electric truck plant, which will remain inactive until the end of the year, as the company faces lower-than-expected demand for electric vehicles. Other automakers worldwide, such as Nissan and Volkswagen, have also warned of significant layoffs.

**General Motors Announces Second Round of Layoffs Amid Electric Vehicle Subsidy Uncertainty**
General Motors announced that it will be laying off approximately 1000 employees, mostly in Michigan, as part of its efforts to optimize speed and perfection in a competitive market. According to the company, this decision is necessary to focus on productivity, having the right team in place, and prioritizing its most important goals. This is not the first time GM has made such a decision, as it laid off employees in August this year due to software issues and technical problems. The company's Blazer EV model sales were temporarily halted in 2023 due to technical issues, which highlighted the need for improvements in GM's software infrastructure. The latest layoff decision comes at a time when GM and other automakers are facing the possibility of losing federal subsidies for electric vehicles, a proposal supported by new President Donald Trump and his advisor Elon Musk.

**What do recent tech layoffs expose about our job reality?**
The recent tech layoffs have exposed the intersection of technology, humanity, and culture in a way that no algorithm can fully calculate. Major players such as Google, Intel, Tesla, and Amazon have been drastically downsizing their workforce, impacting roles across various departments. The layoffs have been carried out with varying degrees of ruthlessness, reflecting the unique business cultures, legal frameworks, and societal values of different regions. In the US, layoffs are fast and brutal, with companies prioritizing efficiency over personal impact. In Israel, layoffs are more personal and emotionally charged, with companies often going to great lengths to cushion the blow. In Europe, layoffs are fought, with strong labor laws, unions, and a deep cultural commitment to workers' rights. The tech layoffs of 2024 reflect not just economic realities but cultural truths, revealing as much about a company's values as its balance sheet. 'The human cost of rapid layoffs is often overlooked, sparking anger and frustration among workers who feel disposable,' said the writer, a corporate cross-cultural business consultant. 'These layoffs expose the intersection of technology, humanity, and culture in a way that no algorithm can fully calculate.'

**Tesla earnings are coming. Here's what to know**
Tesla is set to report its earnings for the July to September quarter, with investors looking for details on the company's plans for artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as its electric vehicles. CEO Elon Musk has promised to unveil a prototype for the next-generation Roadster by the end of the year, with production starting in 2025. However, the company faces regulatory challenges and lawsuits, including a new investigation into its Full Self-Driving technology. Analysts expect Tesla to sell more than 516,000 vehicles between October and December to reach its sales target, but deliveries could miss by as much as 2%. The company's gross margins are also expected to be lower than last year, at 14.7%, due to price cuts to boost demand. 'We need to start seeing this key metric head into the high teens for 3Q/4Q to give the Street comfort much of the price cuts are in the rearview mirror showing better margin days are ahead for 2025,' said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.

**Tech Layoffs Continue in 2024: Over 139,000 Job Cuts in 451 Companies**
The tech sector is experiencing a significant wave of layoffs in 2024, with over 139,206 job cuts in 451 tech companies, according to the independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. Companies such as Tesla, Amazon, Google, TikTok, Snap, and Microsoft have made significant layoffs in the first months of 2024. Even smaller startups have seen a considerable number of layoffs, and in some cases, have shut down operations entirely. The reason for the layoffs is the focus on artificial intelligence, which is accompanied by an increasing attention to costs. The layoffs in 2024 are targeted at sectors that are less profitable. According to McKinsey, by 2030, at least 14% of workers may need to change jobs due to digitalization, robotics, and artificial intelligence. The first companies that can afford to take this path are those that control, to a large extent, the development of the technologies they themselves must use. This is the necessary choice that guides the organizational restructuring that will lead to an increase in employees in more innovative areas and a reduction in employment in less profitable areas.

**Tech Layoffs Reach Alarming Levels in 2024**
According to a study by BestBrokers, 211,033 employees have been laid off in 194 tech companies worldwide so far this year, in addition to the 260,000 layoffs registered in 2023. This brings the total number of tech layoffs between 2022 and 2023 to over 400,000, with a 59% increase in layoffs in the tech industry last year. Women have been disproportionately affected by these layoffs, with 56.9% of recent layoffs occurring in US-based companies. Dell, Intel, and Tesla are among the companies leading the trend, with 18,500, 15,000, and 14,000 layoffs, respectively, driven by fierce competition and declining sales. Google has also confirmed a new round of layoffs, citing a need to reduce costs and optimize investment performance. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is a major factor in these layoffs, as companies seek to reduce costs and invest in AI, which is a rapidly growing area. Many young people who graduated with degrees in tech are now struggling to find work, and some are turning to non-tech jobs. According to a recent survey, three out of five workers fear losing their jobs in the next decade due to AI, and two out of five expect their salaries to decline as a result of AI.

**Thousands laid off in August and September in the technology sector as the global jobs bloodbath intensifies**
The tech industry has seen a massive wave of layoffs, with over 137,500 workers laid off by over 400 companies worldwide, according to Layoffs.fyi. This year, Google laid off over 12,000 workers, while Amazon announced a mandatory return to office for five-days-a-week scheduling starting January 2025. The layoffs are driven by the pressure from hedge funds, investment firms, and billionaires to drive up corporate valuations through 'restructuring' measures, i.e., the destruction of jobs. The working class is being targeted by the ruling class, with highly educated and skilled workers being treated as disposable. The wealth generated by the labor of the working class is concentrated in the hands of a shrinking elite, while tech billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Tim Cook have seen their wealth soar. The layoffs in the tech sector are the result of the drive to maximize profits, often at the expense of long-term growth, stability, and workers' rights.
