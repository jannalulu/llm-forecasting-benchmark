**Democratic Republic of Congo Food Security Outlook October 2024 - May 2025: Crisis! (IPC Phase 3!) expected in areas with high displacement in the east - Democratic Republic of the Congo**
FEWS NET estimates that between 14-14.99 million people will require urgent humanitarian assistance from October to December 2024, during the lean season. Although the number of people in need will decrease in the post-harvest period (January-February 2025), high needs will persist in conflict zones (Ituri, North Kivu, South Kivu, Mai-Ndombe provinces) and areas affected by severe flooding. 'High displacement in the east is expected to lead to a crisis (IPC Phase 3!) in these areas,' according to the Democratic Republic of Congo Food Security Outlook.

**Will Savannah see snow this winter? Here's what Farmers' Almanac predicts for 2024-25**
According to the Old Farmers' Almanac, winter 2024/25 is expected to be a 'calmer, gentler' winter for the U.S., with cooler temperatures in the east and warmer temperatures in the west. For the Southeast region, including Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, precipitation is predicted to be above normal. However, cold snaps are forecasted to hit during the final week of January into early February, bringing frigid conditions. While the almanac is not scientifically proven, it provides a brief summary of its prediction method, which is based on correlations between celestial events and meteorological conditions, as stated by the almanac: 'For over 200 years, the Farmers' Almanac has been predicting long-range weather forecasts to help you plan ahead.'

**Forecast calls for dry, cold weather in coming days**
For the fourth time in five years, La Niña is expected to impact the weather and climate in North and South Carolina this winter, according to the National Weather Service. La Niña is a natural cooling of ocean water that brings global impacts to temperatures, rainfall, and wind patterns. Forecasters predict that two of the past three La Niña winters brought below-normal rainfall across the coastal Carolinas, with rainfall running about 25% below normal. This is concerning, especially given the moderate drought already in place over portions of the coastal Carolinas. The National Weather Service also issued a Hazardous Weather Outlook due to expected frost or freezing temperatures on Friday and Saturday nights. The seven-day forecast calls for highs in the mid-50s and low 60s, with lows in the mid-to-low 30s.

**“Wreaths Across America” to recognize thousands of Veterans on December 14th**
Governor Henry McMaster has proclaimed December as 'Wreaths Across America Month' to recognize the organization's efforts in honoring Veterans throughout South Carolina and the country. On December 14th, over 2 million volunteers will lay wreaths at Veteran gravesites across the US, including over 13,000 at Fort Jackson National Cemetery in South Carolina. According to Carol Davis, the local coordinator, 'It's important for all of us to recognize and remember our Veterans and let them know that we care... This proclamation is a sign that SC loves her Veterans.' Representative Chris Wooten notes that the local community provides enough wreaths to cover every gravesite at Fort Jackson National Cemetery, saying, 'It's an honor as an old Marine to see some folks that are really still... patriotic, but SC just loves their Veterans and it's such an honor to be apart of that.'

**FIRST ALERT: Drought conditions slowly improving in South Carolina**
The latest drought monitor shows slow improvements in South Carolina, with 72% of the state now experiencing drought conditions, down from 100% last week. Moderate drought conditions still affect Horry, Georgetown, Dillon, and parts of Marlboro County. While today's rainfall will help, more consistent and significant rainfall is needed to address the rainfall deficits. The next cold front, expected next week, will bring isolated showers, but it will not be enough to significantly alleviate the drought.

**Influx of baby boomers to South Carolina is creating a 'gray tsunami'**
South Carolina's population is experiencing a 'gray tsunami' as baby boomers are moving to the state to live out their golden years. By 2040, more than a third of residents in five counties will be 65 or older. The state will need to provide more assisted-living facilities, nursing home beds, and medical facilities to meet the growing demand. Frank Rainwater, executive director of the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, said, 'On a state level, you will need more assisted-living facilities, more nursing home beds, more medical facilities.' The aging population will face increasing problems with access to healthcare services and reliable transportation. Jasper County, which is on the coast, may face the most dire crunch, with nearly 47 percent of the population expected to be 65 or older by 2040. Home-health aide work and other jobs that serve older people don't often pay well, complicated by the high cost of living in coastal South Carolina. Connie Munn, director of South Carolina's Department of Aging, said, 'We're ready. We will have a system in place.' She prioritizes helping seniors stay in their homes and be cared for instead of putting them in nursing homes, where resources are spread thin.

**Floods in South Sudan: 1.4 million people affected, 379,000 displaced**
The floods in South Sudan have affected 1.4 million people and displaced over 379,000, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The OCHA also warned of a resurgence of malaria in several regions affected by the floods. The situation is critical, with over 7 million people facing food insecurity and 1.65 million children suffering from malnutrition, according to the World Food Programme (WFP). The WFP has launched an urgent appeal for donors to provide funds quickly, as its food reserves in South Sudan are empty and it needs $404 million to prepare aid for 2025. Without rapid funding, the WFP estimates that it will have to resort to costly air drops to reach isolated communities, which are the most vulnerable. The country is still recovering from a five-year civil war that ended in 2018, and is plagued by power struggles, corruption, economic stagnation, and climate disasters. The government has announced a two-year delay of the country's first-ever elections, scheduled for December, which has sparked frustration among the country's partners and the United Nations.

**USDA Announces Approval of D-SNAP for South Carolina Disaster Areas**
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced that residents in South Carolina affected by Hurricane Helene may be eligible for food assistance through the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP). Approximately 357,291 households in 28 South Carolina counties and one Tribe are estimated to be eligible for this relief to help with grocery expenses. USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack said, 'USDA is committed to making sure that families, farmers and communities impacted by recent hurricanes get the support they need, including help with grocery expenses as people grapple with significant disruption to their lives.' The D-SNAP application period in South Carolina will be from November 12 to 21, 2024, and December 2 to 13, 2024. Eligible households will receive one month of benefits equal to the maximum monthly amount for a SNAP household of their size.

**Southern Africa: Humanitarian Snapshot (As of October 2024) - Zambia**
Over 26 million people in 12 Southern African countries are experiencing crisis levels or worse of food insecurity due to back-to-back climate shocks, including the 2023-2024 El Niño event. Six countries have declared a state of disaster due to severe drought, while 24.8 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. Malnutrition rates have spiked, with an estimated 1.1 million children at risk of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in 2024. Disease outbreaks, including cholera, measles, and mpox, continue to affect the region. A 60% chance of La Niña occurring from September to November is expected to persist through January to March 2025, with normal to above-normal rainfall projected for the region, except for eastern parts. Despite challenges, humanitarians continue to support those in need, but only 30% of the required $1.4 billion has been received to reach 8.3 million people.

**How South Carolina’s population has changed since 2020 and what it could mean for the election**
South Carolina's population has grown by over 250,000 people since 2020, making it the fastest-growing state in the nation. The influx of new residents, mostly from neighboring Georgia and North Carolina, has raised questions about how the shifting electorate could impact the 2024 election. Despite the growth, fewer people are registered to vote than in 2020, and the newcomers who have registered are disproportionately Republican. However, population declines are happening in rural areas, primarily in the Pee Dee region, where Democrats tend to lean more heavily. The state is also seeing a shift in the average age of people moving to the state, with a growing number of retirees flocking south in search of warmer weather and lower taxes. Whether this has any electoral impact will primarily depend on turnout, according to Kirk Randazzo, a political science professor at the University of South Carolina. 'The 65 and older crowd is much more reliable in terms of showing up to vote,' he said. 'And the younger demographic tends to not show up, especially if there are obstacles or inconveniences that kind of stand in the way of casting their vote.'

**Dry Weather Patterns: What's causing our extended drought**
The Southeast, including South Carolina, is experiencing an extended drought due to dry weather patterns. La Niña is contributing to this by favoring conditions that keep rain systems away from the region. La Niña has brought in more high-pressure activity, which pushes rainstorms away and keeps the skies clear and dry. As a result, the region is experiencing a lack of tropical activity, reducing the chances for relief from heavy rains in late summer or early fall. This is making it even more challenging for South Carolina to receive the rain it needs.

**North Carolina Drought Worsens, Leaving Residents Without Access to Clean Water**
A severe drought in North Carolina has left residents struggling to access clean water, with many relying on bottled water or driving long distances to collect it. The drought has also affected healthcare facilities, with some forced to shut down due to a lack of water. According to Dr. Jeffrey Shaman, director of the Center for Climate and Weather Extremes at Columbia University, 'This is not just a drought, it's a drought of the highest order.' The drought has led to an increase in respiratory problems, with many residents experiencing symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 60% of Americans have at least one underlying health condition, and 40% have multiple conditions, making them more susceptible to illness. The drought has also exacerbated existing health issues, with a surge in cases of heart disease and pneumonia. In North Carolina, over 230 people have been affected by the drought, with 17 reported deaths in Florida's Miami-Dade County. The drought is expected to worsen, with the National Weather Service predicting a high chance of severe weather events in the coming weeks.

**Severe drought in southern Africa leaves 15m people in urgent need of food aid**
A severe drought in southern Africa, caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon, has left 15 million people in urgent need of food aid, starting this month. The region, which includes countries such as Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia, Angola, Botswana, and Lesotho, is experiencing its worst drought in 40 years. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 22 million people are facing high levels of food insecurity, with 2 million children suffering from acute malnutrition. The WHO report notes that the food stocks of countries in the region have reached a critical point, leading to a severe humanitarian crisis. The situation is expected to worsen in the coming months, with an increase in disease outbreaks, including cholera, malaria, and measles. The drought has also led to an energy crisis, with countries such as Namibia and Zambia experiencing daily power outages. The region is expected to be under the influence of the La Nina weather phenomenon next month, which could lead to above-average heavy rainfall, but also potential floods and waterlogging that could affect agriculture.

**Drought in Southern Africa: Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Public Health Situation Analysis (PHSA) (14 October 2024) - Angola**
The 2024 El Niño event has caused widespread drought conditions in southern Africa, affecting countries such as Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The drought has led to severe food shortages, limited access to clean water, disease outbreaks, and loss of livestock. According to FEWS NET estimates, nearly 23 million people are facing high levels of food insecurity, with Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique being the most affected. It is estimated that between 14.0 and 14.9 million people will need urgent humanitarian assistance during the lean season from October to December 2024. The drought has also led to the displacement of thousands of people, disease outbreaks, and significant impacts on agriculture. The situation is further complicated by the ongoing cholera epidemic and the emerging risk of mpox, which may divert resources and response efforts away from the drought response in some affected countries. 'The situation has relatively stabilized', but water shortages are undermining hygiene and sanitation efforts, and the risk of cholera outbreaks remains in countries such as Malawi and Mozambique. The drought may also increase the risk of HIV and AIDS transmission, mental health issues, and gender-based violence, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced preparedness and response mechanisms.

**South America Faces Severe Drought, Power Outages, and Economic Consequences**
The International Center for Research on the El Niño Phenomenon has released a report on the drought affecting South America. The report states that the region is experiencing a more severe drought than in previous years. August 2024 was the warmest month on record, with temperatures breaking global records for the 15th consecutive month. The prediction for October is that there will be above-normal rainfall in the Pacific region of Colombia and southern Brazil, but below-normal rainfall in northeastern South America, the coast of Ecuador, the Amazon, and central and southern Chile. The drought, caused by a lack of precipitation, has kept some of the country's reservoirs below historical levels, affecting the production of hydroelectric energy. As a result, the country has been experiencing power outages since September, lasting up to 10 hours a day. The forecast is not encouraging until December. 'In the next quarter (October to December 2024), temperatures are expected to be above normal in most of South America, especially in northern Venezuela, Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, the Titicaca basin, eastern Amazonia, and northwestern Argentina.' The report also states that there will be below-normal rainfall in Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, eastern Amazonia, western Ecuador, southern Brazil, and central and southern Chile. The drought has already affected communities in the Sierra and Amazon regions, with over 4,000 hectares of land burned, including crops and pastures. The consequences of the drought include transportation disruptions, food insecurity, water shortages, and reduced air quality. The report notes that the drought is more severe than in 2023, when the Amazon experienced its worst drought on record. 'This affects transportation, food security, water provision, and access to services. More than 2.5 million hectares of Amazonian forest were burned in the month, almost double the historical average, causing populations in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay to be affected by smoke and reduced air quality.' The report also mentions that the level of Lake Titicaca remains below historical averages, with a 17-centimeter drop in August due to scarce rainfall and high solar radiation. 'The river flows of Ramis, Coata, and Ilave, tributaries of the lake, have deficits of 51%, 83%, and 30% compared to their historical averages.' The report concludes that the drought is a prolonged decrease in water resources in a given region, which has socio-economic consequences. Its impact depends on the population's preparation and the characteristics of the region's economic activities in relation to their water consumption. The report classifies drought as a physical phenomenon into four categories: meteorological, agricultural, hydrological, and socio-economic.

**SC legislature won’t return early for Helene special session**
South Carolina's legislature is not planning to hold a special session to address the damage from Hurricane Helene before January 2025. Senate President Thomas Alexander said it's premature to estimate the financial impact of the storm, but by January, they will have a better handle on the costs. The state has over $300 million in reserves for unexpected expenses. The damage estimate from Helene has surpassed $250 million, with over 5,200 homes damaged and more than 300 destroyed. Homeowners and renters in 23 counties are eligible for individual assistance from FEMA. Nearly 30 counties have been approved for public assistance, which covers local government costs like debris removal. Agencies such as the Department of Transportation and the National Guard will need help to cover costs from storm response and recovery. Commissioner of Agriculture Hugh Weathers said all farmers in South Carolina have taken a hit this year due to the summer drought, Debby, and Helene. Lawmakers are considering supplemental assistance for farmers and whether to incentivize utilities to bury powerlines, but said it's too soon to know.

**UN Prepares for Drought Conference, Highlights Human-Made Causes**
The United Nations is searching for a solution to stop or at least slow down the spread of drought periods. A partial answer was prepared in Geneva this week, but not given. Delegates from all countries that have joined the UN Convention against the Spread of Drought (UNCDD) have been negotiating in climate-controlled rooms. The four-day meeting ('Drought Resilience +10') in Geneva did not result in breakthroughs, but it laid the groundwork for the conference of contracting states in December. The goal is to adopt a binding final document that obliges individual states to fight droughts according to a global plan and with joint forces. This includes cross-border planning of measures against drought, building early warning systems, joint crisis management, management of water resources, grasslands, and forests. The UNCCD aims to finalize this document in a few weeks and will discuss the causes of droughts in December in Riyadh. Droughts are human-made, caused by climate change, overuse of land, urbanization, excessive irrigation, deforestation, and soil degradation. The UN estimates that 90% of the world's population will be affected by drought, heat, and their consequences by 2100, and that the number of people suffering from extreme heat combined with drought will more than double. Even if the global average temperature increase is limited to 1.5°C by the end of the century, 120 million people will still suffer from extreme heat. The UN has calculated that managing water resources can save up to $1.4 trillion worldwide, protecting mangroves can save an additional $1 trillion, and making new infrastructure more resistant to heat and drought can save $4 trillion. The drought in South America is particularly severe, with the Amazon River's water level at 4.5 meters below the normal level. This has cut off hundreds of smaller towns and villages, forcing residents to walk for hours under the scorching sun to buy groceries. The European satellite program Copernicus has reported that the Amazon rainforest has emitted three times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere due to extensive forest fires, a record not seen since 2010 in Brazil and not seen in the past 25 years in Bolivia.

**Candidates Commit to Climate Action Ahead of 2024 Elections**
With the recent floods in the South, the long drought in the country, and the wildfires of probable criminal origin in various regions, the climate issue has become a pressing concern for the population in 2024. As a result, initiatives have emerged to promote candidates committed to addressing climate change. Áurea Carolina, ex-vereadora and director of Nossas, emphasizes that 'democracy and social rights cannot be discussed without considering the consequences of climate inequality.' The organization has created the Vote pelo Clima platform, which brings together candidates who have committed to developing policies for energy transition, environmental protection, and urban adaptation to reduce tragedies. Over 1,000 candidatures from various parties have been registered, with no restrictions on party affiliation. Another initiative, the Bancada do Clima, was created by members of the Rede, PSDB, and PSOL parties, and currently has over 240 candidates in 26 states. Mercedes Bustamante, professor at the UnB, highlights the importance of municipal policies in addressing climate change, citing examples such as the creation of an inventory to identify pollution sources and project ways to reduce impact. Victor Marchezini, professor at the Unesp, emphasizes the need for municipalities to prepare for extreme climate conditions, with detailed plans for prevention and response to crises.

**Drought in South of Sonora Threatens Thousands of Jobs**
The drought in the South of Sonora is putting thousands of jobs at risk, as the area's agricultural production is expected to be severely reduced. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Inegi), around 400,000 people are employed in agriculture in Sonora each year, with at least half of them working in the South of the state. However, due to the drought, the area that will be planted in the 2024-2025 cycle is expected to be only 13% of the usual 300,000 hectares. Luis Jesús Valenzuela, a 48-year-old farmer, expressed his concern about the lack of work, saying, 'It's hard to believe that there's no work, because every year there's a shortage of people, but never a shortage of work.' Luis Cruz Carrillo, president of the Yaqui River Irrigation District, stated that the situation is 'very discouraging' and that there is no possibility of improvement before the start of the agricultural cycle on October 10. He added that the three dams in the Yaqui River system are at 19% of their capacity, compared to 40% at the same time last year. Cruz Carrillo emphasized that there will be a 'serious shortage of circulating funds for the economy of the South of the state' and that 4.5 million workdays will not be given due to the lack of planting. Omar Cruz Guillén, secretary of the Alianza Campesina del Noroeste (Alcano), expressed that the situation affects not only farmers but also the entire community, as the two valleys generate at least 20 million pesos per cycle and the reduction will have a 'grave economic impact' of over 12 million pesos. He called on the federal government to apply an emergency plan to support those affected by the drought.
