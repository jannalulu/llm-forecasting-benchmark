**Supreme Court Completes Membership, Clears Path for Unconstitutionality Demand Analysis**
The Supreme Court of Justice will complete its full membership today, allowing it to analyze the demand for unconstitutionality presented by former President Ricardo Martinelli against the sentence issued in the 'New Business' case. The court's secretary general had previously announced that the analysis would be delayed until after November 27 due to the absence of some magistrates. However, with the return of magistrates and the completion of the full membership, the court can now proceed with the analysis. The demand was presented by lawyer Carlos Carrillo, who argued that the sentence infringes the Constitution and the American Convention on Human Rights.

A new Emerson poll has been released, showing a significant approval bump for President-elect Donald Trump, with a 54% favorability rating, a six-point increase from his pre-election rating. Trump's cabinet picks are also generally approved of. In the 2028 elections, Republicans favor JD Vance as their candidate, while Democrats favor Kamala Harris. The poll also found that 39% of registered voters believe there will be another World War, while 26% do not think there will be another World War. Additionally, 37% of voters believe aliens have visited the Earth, a 12-point increase from 2022. Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said, 'Trump's favorability varies significantly by gender, race, and age.'

**'Optimistic For The Future': CNN's Enten Breaks Down Americans' Historically High Approval Of Trump's Transition**
CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten analyzed Americans' historically high optimism and approval for President-elect Donald Trump's transition period. A CBS News/YouGov poll found that 59% of voters approve of Trump's transition and 50% believe America's best days are ahead. Enten noted that Trump's net approval rating has jumped from +1 points to +18 points since his first transition in November 2016, indicating that Americans are giving him the 'benefit of the doubt.' Enten said, 'The bottom line is this, if 8 years ago people were lukewarm on Donald Trump, at this particular point they're giving him much more of the benefit of the doubt and a lot more Americans are in love with this transition.' Americans are more optimistic about Trump's upcoming presidency compared to 2016, with 53% now being 'excited or optimistic' and 46% being 'concerned' in December 2016. Enten further pointed out that a majority of Democrats (56%) said they either are not motivated to oppose Trump or support him, indicating that Democrats appear 'exhausted' from fighting against Trump and have become less motivated to stand in his opposition since 2016.

**Dina Boluarte's Approval Rating Hits Record Low at 3% in Peru**
According to Datum, the approval rating of Peruvian President Dina Boluarte has dropped to 3%, the lowest level of her presidency since she took office in December 2022. Her disapproval rating has increased to 94%, the highest in the world. The remaining 3% consists of Peruvians who are undecided or do not have a clear opinion about her leadership. Boluarte's approval rating began to decline drastically in November 2023, when it was at 11%. The disapproval rating has been increasing steadily since January 2024, reaching 91-92% in recent months. The low approval rating is attributed to various factors, including rising insecurity, economic crisis, and a perception of disconnection between the government and citizens. Datum's results also show that 80% of Peruvians distrust the prosecutors, 77% consider the judges inefficient, and 63% do not trust the National Police of Peru. As Boluarte said, 'the people consider me as someone who is out of touch with their needs.'

**America's Regressive Institutions: Weekly Update (11/17/2024)**
Congressional approval is declining, with a slight increase in the percentage of people disapproving of Congress. While the recent election sent the GOP back to the House of Representatives, the public's perception of Congress remains unfavorable. The Supreme Court, criticized for its handling of rights and detention in ICE facilities, also faces scrutiny. According to recent data, the Supreme Court's approval rating has not been explicitly mentioned in the article, but the tone suggests a negative view of the institution.

**US Supreme Court: A Check Or An Enabler Of Second Trump Presidency? - UrduPoint**
The US Supreme Court's composition could change significantly if President-elect Trump appoints new justices during his second term. With two of the oldest justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, nearing retirement age, they may choose to step down, allowing Trump to nominate replacements who share their conservative philosophy. According to law professors Christopher Peters and Steven Schwinn, this presents an opportunity for Thomas and Alito to retire with the assurance that their successors would continue their judicial views. Schwinn also noted that the court's recent immunity ruling for Trump could 'affirmatively invite' a president to engage in illegal behavior, while also immunizing themselves. However, the court's approval ratings are at near-record lows, and there are perceived ethics questions surrounding the justices' luxury vacations paid for by Republican billionaires.

**Supreme Court Approves Reform Limiting States' Debt Contracting Expenses**
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) approved a 2022 reform pushed by Morena that sets a limit on states and municipalities' additional expenses when contracting public debt. The reform, which was challenged by 44 opposition senators, was declared valid by the court in a public session. According to the reform, local governments can only allocate up to 0.15% of the financing amount to cover costs related to debt contracting, such as opening and disposal commissions, and costs for contracts with rating agencies and derivative instruments. As stated by Minister Luis María Aguilar Morales, 'the article 2, paragraph 2, of the Law of Financial Discipline of the Federal Entities and Municipalities, added by the decree published on May 10, 2022, in the Official Gazette of the Federation, is valid.'

**Dissatisfaction with Supreme Court justices surges in Japan**
A recent national review in Japan showed a surge in disapproval ratings for six Supreme Court justices, with four receiving over 10% disapproval. The chief justice, Yukihiko Imasaki, received the highest disapproval rating at 11.46%, likely due to his involvement in several high-profile cases concerning the rights of sexual minorities. An increase in available information about the justices and the influence of a popular morning drama series, 'Tora ni Tsubasa', may have contributed to the sudden rise in disapproval ratings. 'I used to think that trials and judges had little to do with me, but this time I found myself interested,' said a 30-year-old public servant from Aomori city, who credited the drama with sparking her newfound interest in the justices. 'This time, I felt I could make a decision based on my own criteria,' she added. No justice has been dismissed through this process, and critics say national reviews have become a mere formality. 'It's quite possible that the drama raised public interest,' said Shinichi Nishikawa, a professor of political science at Meiji University. 'For the 2024 review, major media outlets created special pages on their news sites to provide more comprehensive coverage, giving the public more opportunities to learn about the justices and their decisions.'

**Abbreviated Pundit Roundup: More introspection and analysis**
Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter's warning about democracy dying in the US due to lack of civic knowledge is still relevant today. The 2024 election was not about Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, but about the presidency of Joe Biden. If he had higher approval ratings, either he or Harris would have won. The Democrats should have a reckoning about becoming the party of the college-educated, which has affected their ability to message. Millions of ungettable GOP votes are set in stone due to years of marinating in complete craziness. The left needs to rebuild and grapple with the wreckage of 50 years of neoliberalism, which has left Americans adrift. The 2024 election was a cataclysm, with an electoral map wipeout and a Senate D practical ceiling of 52 seats. Republicans have a ceiling of 62 seats. The left needs to pick big fights and expand its tent to address the crisis of meaning and purpose fueling MAGA.

**Democrats’ three big mistakes**
The US election results may seem to fit a global trend of voters rejecting incumbent leaders, but Kamala Harris could have bucked the trend. The US economy is performing well, with strong employment, rising wages, and decreasing inflation. Additionally, Donald Trump's weaknesses as a political figure, such as his low approval ratings, could have been exploited. According to a CNN poll, Trump's approval rating was as low as 34% after the January 6, 2021, incident, and his favorable rating sank to 31% in a CNN poll after the 2022 midterms, with an unfavorable rating of 60%. As a result, Republicans were disillusioned with him, and Ron DeSantis was outpolling Trump among Republicans in a Wall Street Journal poll in December 2022.

**Milei's Positive Image Reaches 50%: Survey**
A recent survey by Fundación Pensar found that the positive image of President Javier Milei has reached 50% and only 1 in 10 voters 'regrets' their vote. The survey, conducted in October 2024, showed that 49% of the population supports the government's plan, which has achieved some of the goals set during the campaign, such as reducing inflation and reducing state spending. The main asset of the government, according to the survey, is that Milei 'is doing the same thing he promised in the campaign'. 53% of the surveyed Argentines considered that the national government is 'better or equal to what they expected'. The government maintains the support of the vast majority of voters who supported its proposal in the runoff election last year. Milei will travel to the United States next week, with expectations of a meeting with Donald Trump. 'Very few voters regret their vote in the second round', the Foundation noted. Despite the critical economic and social context, the government has a solid approval rating, which grew from 45% in January to 49% in October 2024. One of the conclusions of the study is that Milei's image, fixed around 50% in the last measurement, is 'stable and deep'. 'In a context of recession, increase in tariffs and measures such as the veto to the increase in pensions, half of the population still maintains a positive image of the President', indicated from the Fundación Pensar.

**5 de noviembre: A turning point for Mexico**
Today, November 5, 2024, marks a turning point for Mexico. The country is at a crossroads, with a new government facing challenges in both politics and economics. The outcome of the US presidential election, between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, will have a significant impact on the relationship between the two countries and the Mexican economy. The Mexican government, led by President Claudia Sheinbaum, is facing a constitutional crisis, with the Supreme Court set to vote on a project of sentence that could invalidate part of the reform to the Judicial Power. The crisis could deepen if the project is approved, putting the government in a position to either accept or reject the court's decision. Additionally, the government is expected to present its first economic package on November 15, which will outline the plan to reduce the fiscal deficit from 5.9% to 3%. The credibility of the government's plan will determine whether credit rating agencies maintain or modify their ratings on Mexico. Furthermore, the government is planning to eliminate autonomous bodies, with the process set to begin on November 6. This move has raised concerns about the balance of power and democracy in Mexico.

**Mexicanos 'hacen montón' con Sheinbaum: ¿Qué porcentaje la apoya con la reforma judicial?**
According to a recent survey, 49% of respondents consider Claudia Sheinbaum's handling of the judicial reform to be 'very good or good'. In contrast, 26% believe it has been 'bad or very bad'. The reform, which was approved 15 days before Sheinbaum's presidency, has been met with protests from judicial workers. Sheinbaum has called for the workers to return to work, assuring them that their rights will not be affected. The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has accepted a review of the reform, which is scheduled to be discussed on November 5. Sheinbaum has stated that she has a plan in place in case the court decides to reject the reform. The National Electoral Institute (INE) will also review the budget for the extraordinary election, which is expected to elect over 1,000 judges. Meanwhile, Sheinbaum has an approval rating of 70% after her first month in office, with 24% disapproving of her performance.

**Win the vote but still lose? Behold America's Electoral College**
The US Electoral College system, established by the US Constitution in 1787, allows a presidential candidate to win the White House by securing an absolute majority of the 538 electors, rather than receiving the most popular votes. This system has led to five instances where the winner of the popular vote did not win the presidency, including Donald Trump's 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton. Trump described his win as 'beautiful,' despite Clinton receiving nearly three million more votes nationally. The system has been the subject of debate and proposed amendments, but none have succeeded. In the 2024 election, Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris will face off, and the Electoral College will once again be in focus. The electors, who are typically local officials or party leaders, will gather in their state capitals on December 17 to cast their votes for president and vice president. While some states require electors to respect the popular vote, others do not, and the Supreme Court has ruled that states can impose punishments on 'faithless electors' who do not follow the popular vote.

**Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation Ministers Resign in Protest of Constitutional Reform**
In a unprecedented move, the resignation letters of eight out of the 11 Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) ministers were made public, along with their decision not to run for re-election. The resignations also include those of magistrates Lilia Mónica López Benítez and José Alfonso Montalvo Martínez from the Federal Judiciary Council (CJF) and their decision not to participate in the 2025 popular election process for judges, magistrates, and ministers. The ministers' letters state that they are resigning due to congruence with the current constitutional text, but do not imply their approval of the constitutional amendment. SCJN President Norma Lucía Piña Hernández stated, 'This resignation does not imply my conformity with the separation of the position for which I was originally designated until December 10, 2030, but rather an act of congruence and respect for the constitutional text that currently governs us.' Other ministers, including Juan Luis González Alcántara Carrancá and Margarita Ríos Farjat, have also expressed their opposition to the reform. González Alcántara stated, 'I was mistaken in believing that a system of institutions, checks and balances would prevail, respecting the dignity of minorities. But I was mistaken. I was mistaken in believing that reason and freedom would prevail over the clamor of passions.' Ríos Farjat, on the other hand, announced that she will not accept her pension and will donate it to vulnerable children.

**US Election Poll: Trump Leads by Two Percentage Points**
According to the latest poll results, Donald Trump is leading the US elections with 47% of the vote, followed by Kamala Harris with 45%. Trump's presidency has the highest approval rating, with 52% of respondents approving of his work as president, a record high since the poll began in 2022. In contrast, 54% of respondents disapprove of Kamala Harris' work as vice president, while 42% approve. The poll was conducted between October 19-22 with 750 respondents and has a margin of error of 3.6 percentage points. Trump's lead is significant among men, whites, and seniors, with 55% of people aged 65 or older, 53% of whites, and 52% of the middle class expressing favorability towards him.

**Wall Street Journal Poll for US Elections 2024: Will Donald Trump Actually Come Out Victorious over Kamla Harris in the 2024 Elections?**
The latest Wall Street Journal poll for the US elections 2024 shows Donald Trump gaining momentum and leading Kamla Harris by two percentage points. Trump's approval rating has increased to 52%, with voters citing immigration, crime, and the economy as major issues. In contrast, Harris's approval rating has dropped, with voters questioning her stance on these issues. Trump's campaign has linked Harris to former President Joe Biden's policies, and Trump has emphasized his own mastery of immigration issues. The poll suggests that Trump's constant press conferences and claims of bringing change to the country's economic conditions have resonated with voters, who may prefer the 'unhinged' Trump over Harris's more cautious approach. As the elections approach, Harris is trying to attract undecided voters, but the outcome remains uncertain.

**Iowans to vote to retain or remove Iowa Supreme Court Justice David May, other judges**
In the 2024 general election, Iowa voters will decide whether to retain or remove several judges, including Iowa Supreme Court Justice David May, four Iowa Court of Appeals judges, and 64 district court judges. According to the Iowa Judicial Branch, retention elections focus on judges' professional competency rather than their political opinions or controversial rulings. The Iowa State Bar Association (ISBA) released its 2024 Judicial Performance Review, rating each judge on their professional competency and overall demeanor. Notable ratings include: Justice David May, who received middle-of-the-road ratings, with 64.7% of attorneys surveyed saying they would vote to retain him; Judge Tyler Buller, who received 'above average' ratings, with 83.8% of respondents saying they would vote to retain him; Judge Mary Elizabeth Chicchelly, who received high ratings, with 94.5% of respondents saying they would vote to retain her; Judge Samuel Langholz, who received the lowest scores, with only 64% of respondents saying they would retain him; and Judge Mary Ellen Tabor, who received high ratings, with 94% of respondents saying they would vote to retain her. 'Iowans will have the opportunity to make their voices heard on Election Day,' said ISBA officials. 'It's essential to evaluate each judge's performance and make informed decisions about their retention.'

**Marquette Law School Poll: US Supreme Court approval edges upward**
The latest Marquette Law School Poll national survey finds that 45% of adults approve of the job the U.S. Supreme Court is doing, while 55% disapprove. A very large majority, 90%, favor enforcing a strict ethics code for Supreme Court justices. The public is divided on rating the honesty and ethical standards of the justices, with 27% saying that the justices have very high or high standards, 38% rating their ethical standards as average, and 35% saying the justices’ ethical standards are low or very low. The proposal for justices to serve fixed terms, rather than the current system of appointments for life, is very popular, with 83% in favor and 17% opposed. Opinion is more closely divided on whether to increase the number of justices on the Court, with 54% in favor and 46% opposed. The belief that justices’ decisions are motivated mainly by politics has increased since 2019, with 55% now saying this. The public is at a low point in attention to news about the Court, with only 19% saying they have heard a lot about the Court in the last month. A majority of the public favors four of six recent prominent decisions, and opposes two. The parties are in greatest disagreement on presidential immunity and overturning Roe v. Wade. Confidence in the Court has declined, with 27% having a great deal or a lot of confidence, while 39% have little or no confidence. The perceived ideological leaning of the Court has shifted to the right since 2019, with fewer members of the public seeing the Court as moderate and more seeing it as conservative or very conservative.

**Supreme Court trust 'edges upward' despite left-wing attacks: Polls - Washington Examiner**
A recent poll from Marquette Law School found that 45% of adults approve of the Supreme Court justices' work, a two-point increase from July, while a separate survey from Gallup found that 48% of the public trusts the judicial branch. The polls come as Democrats have attempted to make the Supreme Court a key issue for voters, demanding reforms such as a binding code of ethics and recusal rules. Carrie Severino, president of JCN, said, 'This comes after the media has spent the last few years pushing a nonstop false narrative that the Supreme Court lacks public confidence and legitimacy. It turns out the media needs to take a look in the mirror.' Despite a 90% majority favoring a strict ethics code, the public is divided on rating the honesty and ethical standards of the justices, with 27% saying they have 'very high or high standards.'

**US Supreme Court's Approval Rating Hits New Low**
A recent poll shows that 57% of Americans disapprove of the US Supreme Court's performance. The negative sentiment stems from key rulings, including the overturning of Roe vs. Wade in 2022, allowing states to ban abortion, and the decision that former President Donald Trump has broad immunity from prosecution for official acts, a ruling that could be used against his political opponents. As the US approaches election season, the negative perception of the Supreme Court is becoming increasingly relevant.

**A heated election season hangs over the Supreme Court's new term: From the Politics Desk**
The Supreme Court has returned for a new term, but the upcoming presidential election is already casting a shadow over the high court. With a 6-3 conservative majority, including three justices appointed by former President Donald Trump, there is a high prospect that the court could be asked to weigh in on cases before and potentially after the election. Election expert Nate Persily said, 'There's going to be something, I don't think they are going to hear a case before the election, but there will be attempts to draw them in.' The court has already announced 13 new cases it will decide in the coming months, including a bid by gun companies to throw out a lawsuit brought by Mexico seeking to hold them accountable for violence there. Meanwhile, the 2024 polls continue to show a presidential race that remains on a knife's edge, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump essentially tied in national polls and battleground states. Harris has a slightly greater advantage in the Great Lakes states of Michigan and Wisconsin, but those advantages are well within the boundaries of potential polling error. The polls also show that Harris has higher favorable ratings than Trump, after a sharp upswing in her numbers when she became a presidential candidate this summer.

**US Supreme Court returns with guns, transgender rights, online porn...**
The US Supreme Court has begun its 2024 fall term with a docket that includes gun regulation, transgender rights, and online porn. David Cole, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, expects a 'much quieter term' but notes that the presidential election could disrupt the court's proceedings. The justices will hear cases on ghost guns, gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth, and a Texas law requiring pornographic websites to verify the age of visitors. The court has also agreed to decide whether a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Mexico against American gunmakers can proceed. The Supreme Court's credibility has been eroding, with near-record-low approval ratings, particularly among Democrats. As Nancy Gertner and Stephen Vladeck noted, 'The real issue in the new term is about the court itself -- that is, the Supreme Court's increasingly eroding credibility, and what, if anything, the justices are going to do about it.'

**US Supreme Court begins new term with its credibility in the spotlight**
The US Supreme Court began its new term on Monday with major cases lined up, including challenges to 'ghost guns,' trans rights, and pornography. However, the court's credibility is in the spotlight, with some experts believing that the justices' slim docket suggests they are 'making space for the possibility that there would be election cases that they would have to address.' The court's approval ratings are near record lows following controversial rulings and reports about ties between justices and the conservative movement. To regain its legitimacy, the court should do more to ensure its ethics code is followed, tone down its emphasis on originalist readings of the law, and justices should make a greater effort to avoid voting strictly along partisan lines. Kamala Harris has supported President Biden's call for Supreme Court reform, warning of a 'clear crisis of confidence' facing the institution. Critics of the court are 'cautiously optimistic' that Harris would be more proactive than Biden on reform, but sweeping changes would require Democrats to win control of the White House and both houses of Congress.

**Party Divisions in Views of Supreme Court Keep Ratings Low**
The U.S. Supreme Court's ratings remain near historical lows, with only 15% of Americans approving of the court's job performance and 24% trusting the institution. Democrats are driving the low ratings, with 82% believing the court is 'too conservative' and 37% having no trust at all in the judicial branch. Republicans, on the other hand, have a high approval rating of 72% and believe the court's political leanings are 'about right.' The party gap in trust and job approval has reached a record 47 points and 57 points, respectively. The court's image has not recovered since the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett in 2020 and the Dobbs decision in 2022, which overturned Roe v. Wade's finding of constitutional protections for abortion rights.

**Kamala Harris' Approval Rating Reaches New High**
A recent survey by 'Project 538' shows that a majority of Americans now have a positive opinion of Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate. This is a first for Harris, who had a negative image among 53.8% of Americans in July, while only 37.1% had a positive view of her. Harris' approval rating is now higher than that of her rival Donald Trump, who had a 45.7% positive rating. The survey was conducted after a TV debate between Harris' running mate Tim Walz and his Republican opponent J.D. Vance. Walz and Vance criticized each other's Iran policies, with Walz accusing Trump of being 'wankelmütig' (unreliable) and Vance defending Trump's record. 'It comes down to solid leadership,' Walz said. 'Donald Trump is unreliable. He will turn to whoever flatters him the most or where it suits him.' Vance responded that Trump had 'actually provided stability in the world through a effective deterrence.'

**The Supreme Court, An American Crisis**
The US Supreme Court is facing a crisis, with only 18% of Americans expressing confidence in its integrity. A Monmouth University poll found that 6 in 10 Americans believe the Court is out of touch with the public. The Court's approval ratings have plummeted, with registered Republicans dropping from 80% in 2000 to 66% in 2024, and registered Democrats from 70% in 2000 to 15% in 2024. The erosion of faith in the Court is particularly pronounced among marginalized groups, with 52% of women, 61% of African Americans, and 50% of Hispanic Americans holding unfavorable views. Recent rulings, such as the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the elimination of affirmative action in college admissions, have further eroded trust in the Court. Dr. Bridgeforth writes, 'What kind of judicial system allows its members to operate under a veil of ethical ambiguity? The answer is clear: a Court that has strayed far from its foundational principles, increasingly exhibiting behavior that mirrors partisan politics rather than impartial justice.' The Court's handling of redistricting in South Carolina and its complicity in systemic racism have also been criticized. Dr. Bridgeforth concludes, 'The Supreme Court risks becoming a symbol of division rather than a beacon of justice, an outcome that would fundamentally undermine the foundational principles upon which our democracy stands.'
