**Lyft Teams Up With Intel's Mobileye, May Mobility For Robotaxi Services As Tesla Gears Up To Enter Autonomous Riding Hailing Market - Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT)**
Lyft has partnered with Intel's Mobileye and May Mobility to provide autonomous vehicle rides to its customers. The partnership will make Lyft's scaled rideshare platform available to all vehicles with Mobileye's self-driving technology. May Mobility will directly deploy autonomous vehicles to the Lyft platform in Atlanta starting in 2025. 'Lyft's aim is to connect AVs, drivers, riders, and partners to create new opportunities for all,' said David Risher, CEO of Lyft. This move comes as Tesla gears up to enter the autonomous ride-hailing market, with plans to start an autonomous ride-hail service in Texas and California next year. However, Tesla's vehicles may not all operate as driverless robotaxis initially, as some states demand a safety driver until certain milestones are reached. Meanwhile, Uber has a partnership with Alphabet's Waymo since 2023, and plans to bring fully autonomous vehicles to Austin and Atlanta in 2025.

**Why Self-Driving Taxis Won't Replace Ride-Hailing Services Just Yet**
A study by Forbes compared 50 trips in Los Angeles made by Waymo, a self-driving taxi service, and traditional ride-hailing services (Uber and Lyft). The results showed that Waymo was 9.50 $ more expensive on average per trip, and the estimated waiting time before pickup was more than twice as long. While leaving a tip can reduce the difference, the estimated arrival time for Waymo trips was 121% longer than for traditional ride-hailing services. The study concluded that self-driving taxis are not yet a viable option, as they are more expensive and take longer to arrive. As one example, a trip from Santa Monica to downtown Los Angeles took 29 minutes with a traditional ride-hailing service, but 1 hour and 18 minutes with Waymo.

**Self-Driving Taxis Fall Short of Expectations in Terms of Service and Speed**
A recent study by Forbes has revealed that self-driving taxis are not living up to expectations in terms of service and speed. According to the report, Waymo's robotaxis are not only more expensive, but also significantly longer. The study compared Waymo with traditional ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, and found that the average cost of a Waymo ride was $9.50 more than an Uber ride, and the average time was 7.2 minutes compared to 3.4 minutes for other services. As Forbes notes, 'the current offer of autonomous taxis does not align with the initial promises of transportation companies.' The study highlights the challenges faced by autonomous vehicles, including the need for extensive mapping and the adoption of a cautious driving style, which can be perceived as either positive or negative depending on the priority given to safety or speed.

**Waymo Raises $5.6 Billion to Expand Autonomous Ride-Hailing Service**
Alphabet Inc's Waymo has raised $5.6 billion in funding to expand its autonomous ride-hailing service. The investment was led by parent company Google, with existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, and T. Rowe Price also participating.

**Tesla sets sights on 2025 for paid robotaxi revolution, but faces major hurdles ahead**
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has stated that the company plans to roll out driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas next year. However, this claim faces significant regulatory and technical challenges. In California, Tesla will need to secure permits to offer fully autonomous rides, a process that Alphabet's Waymo spent years completing. Musk acknowledged the potential difficulties, saying 'it's not something we totally control,' but added 'I would be shocked if we don't get approval next year.' Ross Gerber, a Tesla shareholder, noted that dealing with regulators is a difficult process. Texas has fewer regulatory requirements, but companies often test for months or years before deploying paid services.

**Musk Reveals Tesla 2024 Driverless Ride-Hailing Plan**
Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced plans to roll out driverless ride-hailing services in California and Texas next year. However, the company will face significant regulatory and technical challenges. Musk stated, 'We think that we'll be able to have driverless Teslas doing paid rides next year.' Despite the challenges, Tesla shares surged nearly 19% after the earnings report, with predictions of 20% to 30% sales growth next year. However, Alphabet's Waymo, which offers paid rides in autonomous vehicles, spent years logging millions of miles of testing before receiving its first permit from the California Public Utilities Commission. Tesla does not have a permit for testing without a driver and has not applied for one. Musk acknowledged the potential difficulties in California, saying 'it's not something we totally control,' but added 'I would be shocked if we don't get approval next year.' Ross Gerber, a Tesla shareholder, said 'dealing with regulators is a very difficult process' and that no one should consider it 'a walk in the park.'

**Tesla's Robo-Taxis Aims for 2025: A Promising Future Faces Significant Challenges**
Tesla aims to launch its Robo-Taxis by 2025, but faces significant challenges in California. The company currently operates an app-based ride-hailing service for employees in the San Francisco Bay Area, but needs permits to offer fully-autonomous rides. Competitor Waymo paid millions for testing permits in California, and Tesla has not applied for a testing permit to operate driverless vehicles. This raises questions about whether Elon Musk can meet the 2025 timeline. 'Things are not going to be smooth for Tesla in California,' as they try to gain the necessary permits. Tesla last used its autonomous vehicle test permit in 2019, which required the assistance of a safety driver.

Elon Musk announced that Tesla plans to roll out a ride-hailing service in two states, California and Texas, next year. Musk stated, 'We've been thinking about this long time...we do expect to roll out ride hailing in California, Texas next year.' He expressed uncertainty about securing approval in California, but believes a ride-hail network will 'definitely' be available in Texas. Tesla has been operating its own rideshare network for employees in California and is in talks with Palo Alto to use its robotaxi in a small rideshare program. However, regulatory approval is expected to be a challenge, given Tesla's numerous litigation and investigations into its technology. Ark Investment Management Director of Investment Analysis Tasha Keeney wrote, '[T]his is a confirmation that they can start a ride-hail service as well. Autonomous ride-hail should unlock a $10T+ opportunity.'

**Waymo's Self-Driving Taxis Now Available in San Francisco**
Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., has made its self-driving taxis available to the public in San Francisco since June 2024. The service allows users to order a ride through an app and travel to their destination without a human driver. The Waymo taxis, which are electric Jaguar I-PACE models, are equipped with 29 cameras, four LiDAR sensors, and six radar units, providing a 360-degree view of the surroundings. The service has been tested by Trending Topics, who found that the taxis can navigate through the city's streets with ease, but may struggle with stopping at pedestrian crossings. The price of a Waymo ride is currently higher than that of a traditional Uber ride, but is expected to decrease as the service becomes more popular. Waymo has also announced a partnership with Uber, which will allow the two companies to offer autonomous ride-hailing services through the Uber app in Austin and Atlanta starting in 2025. 'The Waymo-Robotaxis have already performed over 100,000 paid rides per week,' according to PCMag UK. 'You can order a Waymo and it will arrive within a few minutes,' said a spokesperson for Waymo.

**Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride-hailing trips in Austin and Atlanta**
Uber is expanding its partnership with Alphabet's Waymo to offer driverless ride-hailing trips in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta, beginning in early 2025. This expansion comes as Uber faces investor pressure to step up its autonomous vehicle strategy, particularly ahead of Tesla's planned robotaxi event. Uber riders in Austin and Atlanta can be matched with a driverless Waymo car for some trips through the Uber app. Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said, 'We've been delighted at the positive feedback from our Waymo One riders to date, and we can't wait to bring the comfort, convenience, and safety of the Waymo Driver to these cities in partnership with Uber.' Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi added, 'We're thrilled to build on our successful partnership with Waymo, which has already powered fully autonomous trips for tens of thousands of riders in Phoenix.' The expansion may slow Waymo's encroachment into Uber's market share, as Waymo has doubled its paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 a week since May 2024.

**Self-Driving Cars Gain Momentum in US**
The US ride-hailing market has seen renewed progress in autonomous vehicle technology in 2024, after a slowdown in 2022 and 2023. Waymo, a self-driving startup, continues to be the leader in the field, with its sixth-generation system featuring a more cost-effective sensor setup and enhanced resolution. The system allows for swapping out sensing components to adapt to specific environmental conditions. Waymo has started testing robotaxi services on highways in San Francisco and has expanded its operations to include Dallas and Houston. However, US regulators are investigating Waymo incidents related to potential for crash and property damage. GM's Cruise Automation has also resumed operations in the US, but has faced setbacks, including a pedestrian accident in 2023. Tesla continues to develop its automated driving assist system, but has delayed the reveal of its robotaxi to October 2024. Despite challenges, investment and expansion in 2024 are encouraging in the US market, with sales of autonomous vehicles forecasted to reach 230,000 units in 2034.
