2024-11-22 13:12:08,625 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30358:
To develop a probability estimate for whether lithium carbonate (CNY/T) prices will remain continuously above 70,000 through December 20, 2024, I proceed with the superforecasting methodology:

1. **Reference and Base Rates**: Historically, commodity prices can be volatile, often influenced by supply-demand dynamics and geopolitical factors. However, looking at the recent past, it's rare for prices to remain strictly above a certain threshold for prolonged periods without significant external interventions or shocks.

2. **Breaking Down the Problem**: 
   - Current Price Situation: The latest reported price is around 79,000 CNY/T, which is slightly above the 70,000 CNY/T threshold.
   - Supply Conditions: Recent reports indicate supply curtailments but also a surplus forecasted for 2025, hinting at potential downward pressures.
   - Demand Conditions: The demand seems currently strong, driven by Chinese subsidies for EVs and fears of a trade war; however, a long-term surplus is also noted as a concern.

3. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views**:
   - Outside View: Commodities like lithium often experience price fluctuations due to their global interconnected markets. If we use as a reference class similar historical situations where overproduction and strong short-term demand occurred, prices often dip back below high thresholds after temporary spikes.
   - Inside View: Given the specific Chinese domestic policies and the recent price movements, there is a possibility that current high prices may sustain in the short term, but medium-term outlooks show potential issues.

4. **Clashing Causal Forces**: The primary forces at work are:
   - Positive: Government subsidies, short-term demand increase, and recent supply-side contractions.
   - Negative: Forecasted global surplus in 2025, historical trend of descending from peaks after temporary rises, and risk of resuming mining as prices elevate.

5. **Trend Extrapolation**: Prices have recently surged, but analysts expect potential stabilization or decline due to inventory and surplus concerns.

6. **Degree of Doubt and Balancing Overconfidence**: While the short-term trend is upward, the probability of prices never dipping below 70,000 CNY/T until late December 2024 involves a level of uncertainty due to market volatility.

Based on these analyses, here is the probability estimate:

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Question Understanding:
- We need to predict if lithium carbonate prices will stay continuously above 70,000 CNY/T until December 21, 2024
- Current date is November 22, 2024
- This means prices must not drop below 70,000 CNY/T even once during the next ~30 days

2. Current Situation:
- Current price is around 79,000 CNY/T according to recent data
- Prices have risen from October lows of around 71,000 CNY/T
- Current prices provide some buffer above the 70,000 threshold

3. Positive Factors (Supporting Staying Above 70,000):
- Recent Chinese EV subsidies boosting demand
- Battery manufacturers increasing purchasing activity
- Supply cuts (190,000 tonnes of mine capacity reduced)
- Seasonal increase in demand for year-end deliveries
- Current price momentum is upward

4. Negative Factors (Risks of Dropping Below):
- Overall market remains in surplus
- High inventory levels persist
- Historical volatility shows rapid price changes possible
- Analysts expect continued oversupply into 2025
- Multiple sources indicate 70,000 CNY/T is seen as a key support level
- Only need one daily close below 70,000 to fail

5. Time Factor:
- Shorter timeframe (30 days) makes prediction more manageable
- But also means no room for error - must stay above every single day

6. Analysis:
- While current price provides buffer, the threshold is close to recent lows
- Market fundamentals remain bearish longer-term
- But short-term factors support price stability
- Key risk is that only one daily close below 70,000 fails the prediction

Given the need for continuous compliance and proximity to the threshold, despite current upward momentum, I need to account for significant downside risk.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 45.50%, with 40.25% being the most likely. Probability: 40.25%

To forecast whether lithium carbonate prices will continuously remain above 70,000 CNY/T through December 20, 2024, let's analyze the data and trends:

### Analysis:

1. **Current Price Levels:** As of November 19, 2024, lithium carbonate prices have surged to 79,200 CNY/T. This indicates a current upward trend, driven by a combination of supply cuts (e.g., Australian mine closures) and increasing demand (e.g., from the EV market, Chinese subsidies, and potential pre-emptive buys ahead of a possible trade war due to Trump's upcoming presidency).

2. **Historical Context and Trends:**
   - Recent reports show a rebound from a three-year low around 71,000 CNY/T. The price trajectory from then shows an upward movement, buoyed by current market dynamics.
   - Historically, the lithium market has experienced price volatility, with a significant drop from peaks in late 2022. This indicates susceptibility to sharp changes should any of the demand or supply pressures ease or invert.

3. **Demand-Supply Dynamics:**
   - There is an expected increase in EV demand with Chinese subsidies, suggesting continued demand pressure.
   - Supply-side restrictions due to mine closures further constrain market supply, which supports higher prices.
   - However, there is skepticism about the sustainability of these prices, with some analysts suggesting a potential surplus issue in 2025.

4. **Market Sentiments:**
   - Mixed signals exist, with some indicating price maintenance due to heightened demand and curtailed supply, while others predict a surplus and potential price correction in 2025.

5. **External Influences:**
   - The geopolitical landscape, e.g., potential trade tensions, coupled with Trump's presidency, might increase speculative buying or stockpiling in anticipation.
   - Manufacturing developments, such as potential shifts to alternative battery technologies, could alter demand dynamics.

### Probability Estimation:

1. **Base Rate Analysis:** Given the historical volatility and known factors of market supplies and demand shifts, reference class forecasting suggests caution. Prices have demonstrated susceptibility to both sharp gains and sudden declines.

2. **Scenario Weighing:**
   - **Scenario A (Prices remain above 70,000):** Current support levels and market interventions (like subsidies and production curtailment) argue strongly for maintaining prices above this threshold in the near-term.
   - **Scenario B (Prices drop below 70,000):** Risk factors include a sudden easing of supply restraints or unexpected demand downturns due to economic shifts or alternative technological adoption.

After analyzing the above factors, the potential for prices to remain above 70,000 CNY/T until December 20, 2024, seems favorable but with acknowledged uncertainties stemming from market dynamics and external geopolitical and technological influences.

### Forecast:

Keeping in mind the need to balance historical tendencies with present-day trends, I propose a forecast range based on the evidence and probability constrains driven by these dynamics.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 90.00%, but 82.50% being the most likely. Probability: 82.50%.

2024-11-22 13:12:35,001 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30358:
Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Question Timeline:
- Today is November 22, 2024
- Need to forecast until December 21, 2024 (29 days)
- Price must stay continuously above 70,000 CNY/T

2. Current Situation:
- Recent price: Around 79,000 CNY/T
- Up from October lows of around 71,000 CNY/T
- Recent upward momentum due to:
  * Chinese EV subsidies
  * Supply cuts (190k tonnes of capacity reduced)
  * Some restocking activity

3. Bearish Factors:
- High inventory levels persist
- Market expected to remain in surplus into 2025
- Multiple analysts predict continued weakness
- Historical trend shows sustained price decline
- Seasonal demand typically weak in Q4

4. Bullish Factors:
- Current price provides decent buffer above 70,000 threshold
- Supply cuts starting to impact market
- Chinese stimulus measures supporting demand
- Some inventory restocking occurring
- Cost floor around 70,000 CNY/T for many producers

5. Key Considerations:
- Only need 29 days of price stability above 70,000
- But must be continuous - any single day below fails
- Current price provides ~11% buffer
- Recent price stability in 75,000-80,000 range
- Strong cost support near 70,000

6. Analysis:
The short timeframe works in favor of the prediction, as does the current price buffer and cost support. However, the market remains oversupplied and analysts broadly expect continued weakness. The requirement for continuous price maintenance above 70,000 adds significant risk, as any single day below fails the prediction.

My Prediction: Between 55.20% and 65.80%, with 60.50% being the most likely. Probability: 60.50%.

2024-11-22 13:12:56,978 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30358:
To forecast accurately, I will follow a structured analytic approach while considering base rates, recent developments, supply and demand dynamics, and potential market shocks.

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates**: Historically, commodity prices are volatile and influenced by supply-demand dynamics. The lithium carbonate price has experienced significant fluctuations in the past due to shifts in these dynamics, with recent lows near CNY 71,000.

2. **Breaking Down the Problem**: 
   - **Current Price Level**: TradingEconomics reports prices at CNY 79,000, which is above the CNY 70,000 threshold required to maintain over a year.
   - **Supply Dynamics**: There are supply cuts due to mine closures and production curtailments. While these factors could sustain or increase prices, past episodes of similar disruptions indicate a possible price rebound but not always sustained over a prolonged period. 
   - **Demand Side**: Chinese government subsidies could boost demand, as noted with EV sector incentivization. However, even a temporary increase in demand may face the longer-term surplus forecast for 2025.
   
3. **Causal Forces at Work**:
   - **Bullish Factors**: Government subsidies, supply cuts, price rises in the short term, and rising EV adoption can push prices upward.
   - **Bearish Factors**: High inventories, expected supply surplus in 2025, and a historical trend of price volatility. Some reports also indicate a potentially temporary nature of recent price increases.

4. **Balance of Evidence**: 
   - The short-term evidence appears to suggest that prices will hold above CNY 70,000 given current levels and existing Chinese demand incentives.
   - However, the ecosystem remains fragile with high inventory levels, and long-term forecasts point to an oversupply situation, which could lead to a price decrease.

5. **Weighing Opposing Errors**:
   - Failing to account for market dynamics could underestimate the chance of prices dropping.
   - Overestimating the bullish temporary factors could lead to overconfidence in continuous price maintenance.

6. **Extrapolating Trends**: Current market prices are climbing. However, maintaining consistently above CNY 70,000 needs sustained factors which currently seem challenged by the oversupply forecast and volatile historical patterns in commodity prices. 

Given these considerations, a balanced prediction accounts for recent positive trends countered by underlying risks of oversupply and volatility.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

   - The short-term evidence appears to suggest that prices will hold above CNY 70,000 given current levels and existing Chinese demand incentives.
   - However, the ecosystem remains fragile with high inventory levels, and long-term forecasts point to an oversupply situation, which could lead to a price decrease.

5. **Weighing Opposing Errors**:
   - Failing to account for market dynamics could underestimate the chance of prices dropping.
   - Overestimating the bullish temporary factors could lead to overconfidence in continuous price maintenance.

6. **Extrapolating Trends**: Current market prices are climbing. However, maintaining consistently above CNY 70,000 needs sustained factors which currently seem challenged by the oversupply forecast and volatile historical patterns in commodity prices. 

Given these considerations, a balanced prediction accounts for recent positive trends countered by underlying risks of oversupply and volatility.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To forecast accurately, I will follow a structured analytic approach while considering base rates, recent developments, supply and demand dynamics, and potential market shocks.

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates**: Historically, commodity prices are volatile and influenced by supply-demand dynamics. The lithium carbonate price has experienced significant fluctuations in the past due to shifts in these dynamics, with recent lows near CNY 71,000.

2. **Breaking Down the Problem**: 
   - **Current Price Level**: TradingEconomics reports prices at CNY 79,000, which is above the CNY 70,000 threshold required to maintain over a year.
   - **Supply Dynamics**: There are supply cuts due to mine closures and production curtailments. While these factors could sustain or increase prices, past episodes of similar disruptions indicate a possible price rebound but not always sustained over a prolonged period. 
   - **Demand Side**: Chinese government subsidies could boost demand, as noted with EV sector incentivization. However, even a temporary increase in demand may face the longer-term surplus forecast for 2025.
   
3. **Causal Forces at Work**:
   - **Bullish Factors**: Government subsidies, supply cuts, price rises in the short term, and rising EV adoption can push prices upward.
   - **Bearish Factors**: High inventories, expected supply surplus in 2025, and a historical trend of price volatility. Some reports also indicate a potentially temporary nature of recent price increases.

2024-11-22 13:12:56,991 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30358:
Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Question Understanding:
- Will lithium carbonate stay continuously above 70,000 CNY/T until Dec 21, 2024
- Current date is Nov 22, 2024
- We need to forecast for approximately 1 month
- Any single day closing below 70,000 CNY/T means "No"

2. Current Situation:
- Current price is around 79,000 CNY/T
- Prices recently rebounded from near 71,000 CNY/T in late October
- There's significant inventory pressure
- Prices have been volatile

3. Bullish Factors:
- Recent Chinese EV subsidies boosting demand
- Some production cuts in Australia and other regions
- Potential stockpiling ahead of US election concerns
- Seasonal demand from battery manufacturers
- Current price provides some buffer above 70,000

4. Bearish Factors:
- High inventory levels continue to pressure prices
- Market still expects oversupply in 2025
- Historical precedent shows quick price movements possible
- Recent price was very close to 70,000
- Analysts expect continued price weakness
- Several sources indicate prices could trend lower

5. Risk Analysis:
- Only need one day below 70,000 for "No"
- Month-long timeframe increases risk
- Price was recently very close to threshold
- High inventory creates downward pressure
- Volatile market conditions

Given that we only need one day below 70,000 in a month-long period, and considering the recent close approach to this level, high inventories, and general bearish sentiment, I believe there's a significant risk of at least one breach of this level.

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 25.50%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%

To forecast whether lithium carbonate (CNY/T) prices will continuously remain above 70,000 CNY/T before December 21, 2024, I will analyze the evidence and consider historical patterns, current market conditions, and recent developments.

**Historical Reference:** 
Historically, lithium prices have been quite volatile, influenced by trends in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, global supply disruptions, and geopolitical factors. The price peak in November 2022 at CNY 597,500 and the subsequent dramatic fall to current levels reflect this volatility.

**Current Market Situation:** 
Recent reports indicate that lithium carbonate prices have been hovering slightly above the 70,000 CNY/T threshold, currently trading around 79,000 CNY/T after a period near historic lows. Key drivers of this price level include:
- Supply curtailments due to mine closures in Australia and China, reducing global supply.
- Increased demand, partly driven by Chinese government policies favoring EVs and inventory replenishment amidst fears of trade disputes.
- Speculation and future demand anticipation altering purchasing behaviors and inventories.

**Potential Downward Pressure:**
- Continued reports suggest a global lithium surplus expected in 2025, which could increase downward pressure on prices.
- Some analysts indicate that although demand is currently stronger than usual, the high global inventory, particularly in China, may temper sustained upward price movements.

**Potential Upward Pressure:**
- Ongoing supply disruptions from mine closures and reduced production in Australia could keep the supply tight, supporting prices above 70,000 CNY/T.
- The Chinese government's ongoing support for EVs, along with geopolitical uncertainties like potential trade wars, may further bolster demand.

**Analysis of Current Trends:** 
Given the current market condition of prices slightly above the critical 70,000 CNY/T threshold, several factors must align for prices to drop and stay below this level before December 21. The dominance of lithium in EV batteries and China's aggressive push towards EV adoption are significant supporting factors for prices to remain at least above the 70,000 mark. However, the anticipated surplus and fluctuating demand make it important to calibrate the forecast.

**Balancing Evidence:** 
While the market exhibits clashing forces—high demand and government support against potential oversupply—I estimate a moderate probability that prices will remain above the 70,000 threshold based on the current data. Historically, lithium prices often move in cycles, and the recent support from supply cuts and government policies could help sustain the prices at the current level in the short term.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 80.00%, but 72.50% being the most likely. Probability: 72.50%.

Historically, lithium prices have been quite volatile, influenced by trends in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, global supply disruptions, and geopolitical factors. The price peak in November 2022 at CNY 597,500 and the subsequent dramatic fall to current levels reflect this volatility.

**Current Market Situation:** 
Recent reports indicate that lithium carbonate prices have been hovering slightly above the 70,000 CNY/T threshold, currently trading around 79,000 CNY/T after a period near historic lows. Key drivers of this price level include:
- Supply curtailments due to mine closures in Australia and China, reducing global supply.
- Increased demand, partly driven by Chinese government policies favoring EVs and inventory replenishment amidst fears of trade disputes.
- Speculation and future demand anticipation altering purchasing behaviors and inventories.

**Potential Downward Pressure:**
- Continued reports suggest a global lithium surplus expected in 2025, which could increase downward pressure on prices.
- Some analysts indicate that although demand is currently stronger than usual, the high global inventory, particularly in China, may temper sustained upward price movements.

**Potential Upward Pressure:**
- Ongoing supply disruptions from mine closures and reduced production in Australia could keep the supply tight, supporting prices above 70,000 CNY/T.
- The Chinese government's ongoing support for EVs, along with geopolitical uncertainties like potential trade wars, may further bolster demand.

**Analysis of Current Trends:** 
Given the current market condition of prices slightly above the critical 70,000 CNY/T threshold, several factors must align for prices to drop and stay below this level before December 21. The dominance of lithium in EV batteries and China's aggressive push towards EV adoption are significant supporting factors for prices to remain at least above the 70,000 mark. However, the anticipated surplus and fluctuating demand make it important to calibrate the forecast.

**Balancing Evidence:** 
While the market exhibits clashing forces—high demand and government support against potential oversupply—I estimate a moderate probability that prices will remain above the 70,000 threshold based on the current data. Historically, lithium prices often move in cycles, and the recent support from supply cuts and government policies could help sustain the prices at the current level in the short term.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 80.00%, but 72.50% being the most likely. Probability: 72.50%.

2024-11-22 13:13:47,899 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30358:
To forecast whether lithium carbonate (CNY/T) prices will continuously remain above 70,000 before December 21, 2024, let's consider the relevant data and trends:

**Base Rate and Historical Context:**
1. Lithium carbonate prices have been volatile, with significant fluctuations observed over the past few years. Historically, prices had surged above 500,000 CNY/T in November 2022 before plummeting.
2. Recently, prices have rebounded from lows near 71,000 CNY/T to around 79,000 CNY/T, driven by supply curtailments and increased demand, particularly in China’s EV market.

**Recent News and Market Sentiment:**
1. Numerous news articles over the past month note a surge in lithium carbonate prices largely due to supply-side constraints, including mine shutdowns in Australia, coupled with increased demand from China’s EV push and potential concerns about geopolitical risks (e.g., trade tensions with the US).
2. Despite the recent price uptick, underlying sentiments suggest a potential surplus in the lithium market by 2025. Analysts point to high inventory levels and seasonal fluctuations which could disrupt current pricing stability.

**Current Events and Trends:**
1. Presently, prices are comfortably above the 70,000 CNY/T threshold, with recent daily quotes in the range of 72,000 to 79,200 CNY/T.
2. Government incentives and the "old-for-new" policy are promoting EV purchases, temporarily boosting demand.

**Forecasting Process Using Superforecasting Principles:**
- **Inside View:** Current prices are above 70,000 CNY/T with upward drivers such as reduced supply and increased demand from EV manufacturers buoying prices in the short term.
- **Outside View:** Historical patterns and market conditions illustrated the past volatility, with prices previously experiencing large-scale declines. Analysts predict potential future imbalances.
- **Balancing Evidence:** Acknowledging short-term factors supporting current prices, alongside overarching factors suggesting possible future oversupply.

**Clashing Causal Forces:**
- **Positive Forces:** Supply constraints due to mine closures, Chinese government incentives boosting short-term demand.
- **Negative Forces:** Potential long-term lithium surplus, high inventory levels, and market corrections due to excess supply.

**Conclusion:**
Short-term positive trends (through November 2024) are likely to maintain prices above the critical 70,000 CNY/T threshold. However, as time extends towards December 2024, growing inventories and reduced seasonal demand may pressurize prices, challenging sustained levels above 70,000 CNY/T.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 85.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.

To forecast whether lithium carbonate (CNY/T) prices will continuously remain above 70,000 before December 21, 2024, let's consider the relevant data and trends:

**Base Rate and Historical Context:**
1. Lithium carbonate prices have been volatile, with significant fluctuations observed over the past few years. Historically, prices had surged above 500,000 CNY/T in November 2022 before plummeting.
2. Recently, prices have rebounded from lows near 71,000 CNY/T to around 79,000 CNY/T, driven by supply curtailments and increased demand, particularly in China’s EV market.

**Recent News and Market Sentiment:**
1. Numerous news articles over the past month note a surge in lithium carbonate prices largely due to supply-side constraints, including mine shutdowns in Australia, coupled with increased demand from China’s EV push and potential concerns about geopolitical risks (e.g., trade tensions with the US).
2. Despite the recent price uptick, underlying sentiments suggest a potential surplus in the lithium market by 2025. Analysts point to high inventory levels and seasonal fluctuations which could disrupt current pricing stability.

**Current Events and Trends:**
1. Presently, prices are comfortably above the 70,000 CNY/T threshold, with recent daily quotes in the range of 72,000 to 79,200 CNY/T.
2. Government incentives and the "old-for-new" policy are promoting EV purchases, temporarily boosting demand.

**Forecasting Process Using Superforecasting Principles:**
- **Inside View:** Current prices are above 70,000 CNY/T with upward drivers such as reduced supply and increased demand from EV manufacturers buoying prices in the short term.
- **Outside View:** Historical patterns and market conditions illustrated the past volatility, with prices previously experiencing large-scale declines. Analysts predict potential future imbalances.
- **Balancing Evidence:** Acknowledging short-term factors supporting current prices, alongside overarching factors suggesting possible future oversupply.

**Clashing Causal Forces:**
- **Positive Forces:** Supply constraints due to mine closures, Chinese government incentives boosting short-term demand.
- **Negative Forces:** Potential long-term lithium surplus, high inventory levels, and market corrections due to excess supply.

2024-11-22 13:13:47,911 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30358:
Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Reference Class:
- Current price is around CNY 79,000 per tonne (as of latest data)
- Price has risen from CNY 71,000 in late October
- Historical context shows prices were much higher (CNY 597,500 in November 2022)

2. Time Frame Analysis:
- We need to forecast until December 21, 2024
- This is approximately 1 month from today

3. Positive Factors (Supporting staying above 70,000):
- Recent price increases (8% rise since late October)
- Chinese EV subsidies boosting demand
- Supply cuts from Australian mines (190,000 tonnes reduction)
- Seasonal stockpiling ahead of Chinese New Year
- Current price provides cushion above 70,000 threshold

4. Negative Factors (Supporting falling below 70,000):
- High inventory levels continue to suppress prices
- Market expects long-term oversupply in 2025
- Analysts predict prices will remain range-bound between 70,000-80,000
- Historical downward trend (88% fall from peak)
- Some analysts expect weak and volatile prices around 75,000

5. Key Considerations:
- Short timeframe (1 month) reduces uncertainty
- Current price provides ~11% buffer above threshold
- Multiple sources indicate 70,000 as psychological support level
- Supply cuts and demand increases provide short-term price support

6. Risk Analysis:
- Main risk is rapid price decline due to inventory oversupply
- But timeframe is too short for dramatic shifts given current market dynamics
- 70,000 appears to be cost floor for many producers

Given the short timeframe, current price buffer, and market dynamics, I assess a high probability of prices remaining above 70,000, but with some uncertainty due to market volatility.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 85.50%, with 80.50% being the most likely. Probability: 80.50%

1. Reference Class:
- Current price is around CNY 79,000 per tonne (as of latest data)
- Price has risen from CNY 71,000 in late October
- Historical context shows prices were much higher (CNY 597,500 in November 2022)

2. Time Frame Analysis:
- We need to forecast until December 21, 2024
- This is approximately 1 month from today

3. Positive Factors (Supporting staying above 70,000):
- Recent price increases (8% rise since late October)
- Chinese EV subsidies boosting demand
- Supply cuts from Australian mines (190,000 tonnes reduction)
- Seasonal stockpiling ahead of Chinese New Year
- Current price provides cushion above 70,000 threshold

4. Negative Factors (Supporting falling below 70,000):
- High inventory levels continue to suppress prices
- Market expects long-term oversupply in 2025
- Analysts predict prices will remain range-bound between 70,000-80,000
- Historical downward trend (88% fall from peak)
- Some analysts expect weak and volatile prices around 75,000

5. Key Considerations:
- Short timeframe (1 month) reduces uncertainty
- Current price provides ~11% buffer above threshold
- Multiple sources indicate 70,000 as psychological support level
- Supply cuts and demand increases provide short-term price support

6. Risk Analysis:
- Main risk is rapid price decline due to inventory oversupply
- But timeframe is too short for dramatic shifts given current market dynamics
- 70,000 appears to be cost floor for many producers

Given the short timeframe, current price buffer, and market dynamics, I assess a high probability of prices remaining above 70,000, but with some uncertainty due to market volatility.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 85.50%, with 80.50% being the most likely. Probability: 80.50%
