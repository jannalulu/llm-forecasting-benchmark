**AI Startups, Investors Eagerly Await Less ‘Red Tape’ Under Trump**
As Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, AI executives and investors are expecting a more 'innovation-friendly' approach to regulating AI. Trump has vowed to repeal President Biden's executive order on AI, which established a regulatory framework for generative AI, citing concerns that it hinders innovation. AI leaders, including OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anthropic's Jack Clark, have expressed optimism about the new administration's approach, citing the need for the US to maintain its lead in developing AI with democratic values. However, some experts, such as Dan Hendrycks, Director for the Center of AI Safety, have cautioned that the new administration's policies will need to balance Musk's past safety positions with those of running mate J.D. Vance, who has supported open-source technology. The Trump administration's AI policies will also need to address issues such as chips and export controls, which are likely to become key economic pillars under Trump.

**Forrester's Predictions 2025: Navigating the Future of IT and Security**
According to Forrester's Predictions 2025 report, companies will need to balance pragmatism and audacity in a landscape marked by increasing technological complexity. The adoption of AIOps will triple in response to technical debt, while pressure for return on investment may slow down AI projects. TuringBots will accelerate software development, and private clouds will see a resurgence, but compliance with regulations such as the EU's AI Act will present new challenges for organizations. By 2026, 75% of technology decision-makers will see their technical debt increase to a moderate or high level of severity. This is due to the rapid development of AI solutions, which are increasing the complexity of computer environments. Forrester predicts that leaders in IT will triple the adoption of AI platforms for IT operations (AIOps) in 2025, which offer contextually aware data to improve human judgment, automatically solve incidents, and improve business results. However, the success of AIOps implementation depends on a suitable organizational culture, data architecture, and security practices. The report also warns that the pressure to show quick results may lead some companies to reduce their funding in AI, which would be detrimental in the long term. It is recommended to prioritize differentiated use cases that leverage specific company data and align with a long-term strategy. Additionally, Forrester predicts that 30% of development teams will accelerate their software development life cycle (SDLC) using TuringBots, AI-powered development tools that go beyond coding and testing, automating processes such as creating requirement documents and managing product comments through text and video analysis. The EU's AI Act is expected to come into force in 2025, and Forrester anticipates that a provider of AI generative will receive the first fine for non-compliance. Companies will need to be cautious, evaluating their AI generative providers and ensuring they collect the necessary evidence to avoid regulatory sanctions. As companies seek to control their data and comply with data sovereignty regulations, private cloud computing is expected to experience a resurgence. However, organizations are looking for alternatives to VMware due to recent price and licensing changes. Forrester predicts that demand for private cloud services will increase in parallel with the growth of public cloud, driven by alternative providers such as Nutanix and open-source projects like OpenStack. Finally, the report warns that although AI architectures with 'agent' capabilities generate great expectations, they are still two years away from meeting expectations of complete automation. This type of AI faces technical barriers due to the need for advanced models and complex data architectures, and 75% of companies that attempt to build these systems independently will fail.

**5 Generative AI Trends to Watch in 2025**
Experts predict a surge in the use of AI agents in 2025, which are semi-autonomous generative AI that can interact with applications to carry out instructions. However, the success of projects leveraging generative AI remains uncertain. Cybersecurity professionals will continue to take advantage of AI in 2025, but generative AI may present information that is inaccurate, and security teams must adapt to both using and defending against it. Organizations struggle to determine whether generative AI adds value and to what use cases it can make the most difference. Many companies that are incorporating generative AI at a large scale are seeing success, but others are expected to rigorously test -- and sometimes discard -- the features that don't deliver results. The environmental cost of building the data centers needed to run generative AI is also a concern, and companies will tout dubious and genuine claims of energy savings and environmental friendliness around AI. 'The pendulum has swung from 'new AI innovation at any cost' to a resounding imperative to prove ROI in board rooms across the world,' said Uzi Dvir, global CIO at WalkMe. 'As AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini become deeply integrated into business operations, the risk of accidental data exposure skyrockets with new data privacy challenges,' said Jeremy Fuchs, cyber security evangelist at Check Point Software Technologies. 'AI's growing role in cyber crime is undeniable,' Fuchs added. 'By 2025, AI will not only enhance the scale of attacks but also their sophistication.'

**PREDICT 2025: The Future of AI in the US**
The US financial services industry has been using AI for decades, but the adoption of generative AI tools like ChatGPT has created a new dimension. Despite the lack of a standardized methodology for regulating AI, the industry is continuing to innovate. According to Finextra's Future of AI in the US 2025 report, generative AI is proving valuable for various use cases, but the industry is slow to adopt AI for customer-facing initiatives, focusing instead on back-office automation, data aggregation, and fraud prevention. As automation increases, it may lead to more explainable AI models and a more ethical use of the technology, potentially reducing headcount and allowing bank tellers to take on higher-skilled responsibilities.

**US AI Export Rules Could Change Tech Markets, Experts Say**
The White House has introduced new restrictions on the export of American artificial intelligence breakthroughs, aiming to protect national security and maintain U.S. leadership in AI development. According to industry analysts, this could force American tech giants like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Microsoft to obtain government approval before sharing developments with overseas partners or selling to foreign customers. Kristof Horompoly, vice president of AI risk management at ValidMind, said, 'AI is really becoming a national security question, and there are going to be two sides to that.' The new restrictions could reshape the global AI market, with firms potentially needing government approval for deals with foreign customers, and could affect billions in international AI revenues. However, domestic opportunities could expand as governments increase support and resources to keep AI development within U.S. borders.

**Curbing Code? US Mulls New AI Export Controls**
The Biden administration is considering imposing export controls on AI models, citing security risks. However, leading AI firms, civil society groups, and researchers argue that this move is impractical and counterproductive, as it could undermine US leadership in AI innovation and create constitutional issues. The key question is how such controls could be enforced, particularly for open-source models. US officials emphasize that AI's security risks outweigh the costs, but critics argue that restricting the movement of software bits and bytes is difficult, especially given the success of China's AI industry in using open-source technology. The proposed reporting rules would give the US government data needed to determine which AI models to restrict, but the Administration may not need a stalled bipartisan bill in Congress to implement new controls. Microsoft and Google argue that restricting open models would damage global collaboration on talent, research, and safety, while Meta claims controls on AI would cause the US to cede an opportunity to embed US 'values in the fabric of the AI revolution' by setting global standards.

**US to impose AI investment restrictions in China**
The US government is finalizing rules to ban certain American investments in artificial intelligence (AI) in China, as part of an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023. The rules, which target outbound investments to China in AI, semiconductors, microelectronics, and quantum computing, are expected to be published within the next week. According to Laura Black, a lawyer at Akin Gump, the Treasury department typically allows a minimum of 30 days before new rules take effect, suggesting that the rules may be published before the upcoming US presidential election on 5 November 2024. The proposed rules require US individuals and companies to self-assess which transactions would be restricted, and provide exceptions for publicly traded securities, certain limited partnership investments, and specific syndicated debt financings. Additionally, the US is considering implementing export limits on advanced AI chips to certain countries, including Persian Gulf nations.

**US Reported to Weigh Expanding AI Chip Export Controls to Middle East as Curbs on China Tightened-钛媒体官方网站**
The US government is considering expanding its export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips to more countries and regions, including the Middle East, according to a report. The Biden administration has discussed capping shipments of advanced AI chips from Nvidia and other American companies on a country-specific basis, due to national security concerns. The potential policy aims to prevent AI chip exports from being diverted to China. The US Commerce Department has already introduced new export controls on high-tech items, including AI, and is facilitating a process to introduce additional controls. Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration Thea D. Rozman Kendler said, 'The most effective way to protect our national security is to develop and coordinate our controls alongside like-minded partners.'

**US Considers Stricter Controls on Chip Exports to Middle East**
The US is considering stricter controls on the export of chips produced by American companies like Nvidia and AMD to certain countries, particularly those in the Persian Gulf. This move is in response to the interest of these countries in developing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, which require powerful computational resources. The restrictions may affect countries that could use these technologies for military purposes, including China, which gains access to the technologies through third-party countries, according to Bloomberg. In 2023, the US Department of Commerce already imposed similar restrictions on most Middle Eastern countries, requiring American companies to obtain special licenses for exporting chips and equipment. The current discussions are at an early stage, but new restrictions could significantly impact AI development in the region. As one expert noted, 'The development of AI is a key area of competition between the US and China, and the US is taking steps to ensure that its technological edge is not compromised.'

**US to Tighten Export Framework for AI Chips to the Middle East**
The US wants to tighten the framework for exporting AI chips to the Middle East. According to sources, the cap on the number of export licenses will be set for countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE. This move may strengthen restrictions initially aimed at China in the field of AI. The control will be based on the updated program for checking end-users (VEU), announced by the US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in late September. The program will now include foreign data centers (DCs), which will have to meet export control requirements after a 'thorough interagency review' by the State Department, the Pentagon, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Energy. As BIS stated, 'This will allow US exporters to send certain products to pre-approved organizations under a general license, rather than individual export licenses.' This means that each specific DC will no longer be required to obtain an individual license for specific chips - they will be included in the VEU program after review. Reuters described the BIS initiative as a way to facilitate the export of Nvidia chips for DCs in the Middle East after the US authorities began requiring licenses for their supplies to this region, as well as to Africa and Central Asia, starting from November 2023. However, according to Bloomberg, the number of participants in such a program may be limited.

**US Considers Limiting Export of AI Chips to Certain Countries**
The US administration is considering limiting the export of advanced AI chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. to certain countries. According to Bloomberg, the new approach would set a cap on export licenses for specific countries in the interest of national security. The focus is on countries in the Persian Gulf, where the demand for AI data centers is growing. The discussion is still in its early stages and remains unclear, said sources. The policy would be based on a new structure to simplify the process of licensing the supply of AI chips to data centers in places like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. As noted by the US government, American companies are not being accused of violating export controls, despite their components being supplied to Russia through intermediaries. Yesterday, EU High Representative Josep Borrell stated that Western countries, including EU member states, should increase control over the export activities of companies producing sensitive electronic components used by Russians in the production of weapons.

**Will AI Change the Life of Programmers or Leave Them Without Work?**
The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and globalization is changing the IT and business landscape. According to a survey, 40% of developers are already using generative AI. The number of programmers from developing countries is growing, and India is expected to surpass the US in the number of developers in the near future. The Economist article suggests that AI will make developers more productive and programming software cheaper. The previous revolution in programming was the advent of the internet, which allowed developers to access information online instead of relying on manuals and guides. The spread of generative AI will lead to even more significant changes, as developers will be able to 'delegate' data search to AI. Another consequence of AI development is the emergence of numerous projects to create AI tools specifically for programming. According to PitchBook, a data collection company, around 250 startups are working on such projects. Large technology companies also have their own AI tools for developers. For example, Microsoft's Copilot chatbot can generate code in different languages, correct errors, and simplify it. Over two million users, including employees of 90% of Fortune 100 companies, have subscribed to it. In 2023, Alphabet and Meta also presented their chatbots, and in 2024, Amazon and Apple followed suit. There are also many companies that develop AI assistants only for internal use. Western companies are increasingly outsourcing coding to developers from other countries, allowing them to save on development costs. The authors of The Economist note that AI makes it easier to learn programming, which leads to an increase in the number of specialists in countries that previously lagged behind the West. According to Evans Data Corporation, the number of programmers in the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America is expected to increase by 21% and 17% respectively from 2023 to 2029, while in North America and Europe it will increase by 13% and 9%. Such changes will likely lead to large technology companies hiring foreign developers more often. According to Everest, about half of its IT expenses, including those related to programming, are already outsourced. Many companies that did not engage in IT outsourcing instead opened branches in countries where programmers earn less than in the US. The most popular location for outsourcing is India, which exported software and related services worth around $193 billion in 2023. About half of the IT products produced in other countries were bought by American companies. Sundeep Jain, a representative of the Indian IT company Wipro, told The Economist that his engineers participated in the development of Microsoft Teams corporate platform and chips and software for so-called connected cars. Another Indian company, Infosys, recently announced a five-year contract worth $2 billion. According to the head of the digital services department of the global oil services company Schlumberger, Shashi Menon, outsourcing allows companies to expand without excessive spending. In Menon's team, about half of the programmers are from Beijing and the Indian city of Pune. While AI is not yet developed enough to replace developers, it allows them to get rid of routine tasks. According to The Economist, the development of AI and mass outsourcing in programming are unlikely to leave Western developers without work. Despite all the achievements of recent years, AI's capabilities are still limited. Around 35% of developers who participated in the Evans Data survey replied that AI allows them to save 10-20% of their time. Respondents explained that AI models allow them to solve some basic tasks, but are not very useful in more complex aspects of programming and still make mistakes when writing code. An American software development company, GitClear, found in its research that the quality of code has decreased over the past year - possibly due to the use of artificial intelligence. Perhaps the situation will improve with the emergence of next-generation AI systems. In September, OpenAI released a new model o1, trained on new algorithms. According to its developers, it 'excels at generating and debugging complex code.' The authors of The Economist conclude that AI is unlikely to replace developers - and certainly not in the near future. It is much more likely that AI will continue to be used to solve the most 'boring' tasks, while more creative processes will be handled by developers themselves. Such a distribution of responsibilities will make software more accessible and cheaper.

**Chinese AI firms on track to narrow gap despite Nvidia controls | Insights | Bloomberg Professional Services**
China's AI companies are on track to narrow the performance gap with their US peers, despite earlier concerns about access to imported accelerator chips. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, increased technical innovation, a rising domestic chip supply, and a healthy buffer stock of components will ensure China's AI development remains on track through 2025 and beyond. The US AI chip export controls have been largely ineffectual, as Chinese tech firms had stockpiled Nvidia accelerator chips before the controls came into force. Additionally, Huawei's domestic accelerator chips and potential imports via third-party countries will further limit supply bottlenecks.

**US Establishes New Base for Exporting AI Chips to Middle East**
The US Department of Commerce has announced a new base that may facilitate the shipment of artificial intelligence chips to data centers in the Middle East. Since October 2023, US authorities have required exporters to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. According to the new base, data centers will be able to apply for a certification called 'trusted end-user', which will allow them to receive chips under a general license, rather than requiring individual US suppliers to obtain licenses for each shipment, as reported by Reuters. A US official said that the US will work with data centers that apply for the program, as well as host governments, to ensure the safety and security of the technology. This move comes amid growing concerns in Washington that the Middle East may become a conduit for China to obtain advanced US chips that are prohibited from being shipped directly to China. The company 'G42', a Dubai-based AI company with long-standing ties to China, has been at the center of these concerns. In April, Microsoft announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in 'G42', and plans to provide the company with chips and model weights, advanced data that helps improve the AI model's ability to mimic human thought. The deal raised questions from lawmakers who take a hardline stance against China, despite 'G42' announcing in February 2024 that it would withdraw from China and accept US-imposed restrictions on working with US companies. 'G42' did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. The US Department of Commerce said in a statement that data centers that apply for the program will undergo a rigorous review process to ensure that the necessary safeguards are in place to prevent the transfer of US technology or its use in ways that contradict national security. 'We will work with data centers that apply for the program to ensure that they meet the necessary standards,' said a US official. 'We will also work with host governments to ensure that they are aware of and comply with US regulations.'

The United States is intensifying its 'check on China' over leadership in cutting-edge future technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), energy, semiconductors, and quantum. The US has placed technology and equipment used in the manufacturing of quantum computers and advanced AI semiconductors on export controls. Additionally, a measure was announced to ban the export of connected vehicles using Chinese software or hardware to the United States. The White House cited security risks, including the possibility of hacking attacks on connected vehicles. The US also plans to regulate Chinese connected vehicle technology, with vehicles installed with Chinese software or hardware unable to be sold in the US starting from the 2027 and 2028 model years, respectively. The US has shown its will to block the landing of Chinese electric vehicles at the source, with tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles quadrupled to 100% last May. The US is also securing core technologies that will determine future national capabilities, such as quantum, AI, advanced semiconductors, and space, and maintaining a super gap. This is why the US introduced export control policies on cutting-edge technologies such as quantum computers and AI semiconductor manufacturing in early September. The US is asking its allies to join the front line in the fight against China, with countries with similar export control policies exempted from the licensing process. This is a measure to prevent China and Russia from using these cutting-edge technologies to increase their military power and threaten the democratic camp through cooperation with friendly countries.

**US Tightens Grip on China's Technological Advancements**
The United States is intensifying its check on China over leadership in cutting-edge future technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), energy, semiconductors, and quantum. The US has placed technology and equipment used in the manufacturing of quantum computers and advanced AI semiconductors on export controls. Additionally, a measure was announced to ban the export of connected vehicles using Chinese software or hardware to the United States. The White House cited security risks, including the possibility of hacking attacks on connected vehicles. The US has also raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and imposed regulations on technology and components related to connected vehicles, which would be 'tantamount to a death sentence' for Chinese electric vehicles. The US is seeking to secure core technologies that will determine future national capabilities, such as quantum, AI, advanced semiconductors, and space, and maintain a super gap. This is why the US introduced export control policies on cutting-edge technologies such as quantum computers and AI semiconductor manufacturing. The US is also asking its allies to join the front line in the fight against China, and countries with similar export control policies are exempted from the licensing process. 'We will keep China in check and maintain a super gap in future technology.' The US is demanding that countries such as the Netherlands block the export of advanced technologies to China. 'There is a threat of attack on connected vehicles' and the US is taking measures to prevent China and Russia from using these cutting-edge technologies to increase their military power and threaten the democratic camp through cooperation with friendly countries.

**2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Amid the Sell-Off**
Despite concerns about an AI bubble and recession, investors can find opportunities in AI stocks. Two stocks to consider are Nvidia (NVDA) and ASML (ASML). Nvidia, a leader in AI technology, has pulled back 17% from its peak in June, but demand for its products continues to surge. CEO Jensen Huang said the company is under pressure to deliver for its customers, and big tech companies are willing to spend on generative AI technology. ASML, the leading lithography equipment manufacturer, has a strong economic moat in AI and is expected to see a cyclical rebound in demand for its machines in the second half of 2024 and into 2025. Despite concerns about export controls, the future of the chip fab industry looks brighter than ever, and ASML is likely to be a big beneficiary of the CHIPS Act. Nvidia stock trades down 17% from its peak, while ASML stock trades down 28% from its peak.

**Competition, Not Control, is Key to Winning the Global AI Race**
The United States is facing a challenge from China in the global AI race, despite having much of the world's AI-enabling infrastructure. China is developing state-of-the-art AI systems and investing in its domestic technology base, making global AI competition synonymous with U.S.-China competition. The U.S. is enacting and considering new export controls to limit China's access to AI components, but these controls are difficult to implement and may have unintended consequences, such as a decline in U.S. competitiveness and uncertainty for the domestic tech industry. Instead, the U.S. should focus on competition and outcompeting its geopolitical rivals in AI development, implementation, and diffusion. This can be achieved by adopting a 'do no harm' approach to AI export controls, working with international partners to develop standards for AI adoption, and tailoring new AI systems to diverse international communities.
