**Nvidia surpasses Apple as world's most valuable company for 2nd time this year**
Nvidia has surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable company, closing Tuesday's trading session with a market cap of $3.43 trillion compared to Apple's $3.38 trillion. Nvidia's stock rose nearly 3% as it benefits from the global artificial intelligence (AI) boom, while Apple's growth slowed to a 0.6% increase. This marks Nvidia's second time surpassing Apple this year, following a brief lead in June, when the company's stock grew a staggering 850% since late 2022. Nvidia is also set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday.

**Meet the 3 Supercharged Growth Stocks That Will Be Worth $4 Trillion by 2025, According to a Certain Wall Street Analyst**
A Wall Street analyst, Ives, predicts that Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft will be worth $4 trillion by 2025. Nvidia is the leader in the GPU space and is poised to benefit from the adoption of generative AI. Apple needs a 20% stock price gain to reach the $4 trillion threshold, and Ives believes that the company's loyal customer base and improving macroeconomic environment will drive sales of its AI-powered iPhone. Microsoft is currently the third most valuable company, with a market cap of $3 trillion, and is well-positioned to profit from the growing adoption of AI. The analyst notes that the generative AI market is expected to be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032, and that Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft are attractively priced at 32 times, 30 times, and 28 times forward earnings, respectively.

**Nvidia Overtakes Apple as Most Valuable Company in Stock Market**
Apple has lost its position as the most valuable company in the stock market to Nvidia. According to a recent study by OnDeck, Apple was ranked as the fourth most innovative company in the world, behind IBM, Qualcomm, and Alphabet (Google). However, Apple has now lost a more significant position: that of the best-valued company in the stock market. Nvidia has taken over, with a capitalization of $3.43 trillion, compared to Apple's $3.4 trillion. Nvidia dominates the graphics card market, with a market share of 88% according to a study by Jon Peddie Research. Nvidia's success and stock market valuation can also be attributed to its AI accelerators, which equip 75% of the global market. Meanwhile, Apple's stock price has decreased by 0.2% this Monday, while Nvidia's stock price has increased by 2%. Apple's concerns about the impact of geopolitical tensions on sales and its delay in the AI field may also be contributing factors to the decline in its stock price.

**Meet the Supercharged Growth Stock That Could Join Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet in the $2 Trillion Club by 2028**
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), the world's largest foundry, is poised to join the ranks of the world's most valuable companies, including Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft, with a market cap of over $2 trillion by 2028.

TSMC's customer list includes industry leaders such as Nvidia, Arm Holdings, and Apple, and its revenue has grown 36% year over year to $23.5 billion in the third quarter, with earnings per share (EPS) of $1.94 jumping 54%. Management expects the company's growth to continue, guiding for Q4 revenue of $26.5 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, or growth of about 35%.

**Apple seen becoming the first company to hit $4 trillion market cap - Wedbush By Investing.com**
Analysts at Wedbush predict that Apple Inc. will become the first company to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization by 2025. This forecast comes after Apple's shares have risen by over 24% this year, driven in part by the company's plans to enhance its products with artificial intelligence capabilities. Wedbush analysts believe that Apple's 'Apple Intelligence' features, which will be included in an upcoming update to the iPhone operating platform, will persuade customers to upgrade to new devices. The analysts also highlighted Apple's unmatched installed base of over 2 billion iOS devices, its services business worth $2 trillion, and the growing use of AI through Apple's ecosystem, which will interact with over 20% of the world's population in the next few years. Wedbush maintained an 'Outperform' rating for Apple's stock and kept their price target at $300.

**The Week of the 'Magnifiche 7': A Crucial Moment for the US Economy**
The upcoming week will be crucial for the US economy, with over 1,000 companies, including Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta, releasing their quarterly earnings reports. This will be the last opportunity for voters to assess the state of the economy before the presidential election on November 5. The Federal Reserve is expected to focus on growth data rather than inflation, and the non-farm payrolls data on November 1 will be a key indicator of the labor market. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data on October 31 may also attract attention if it deviates from expectations. The 'magnifiche 7' - a group of seven tech giants - have performed well in the past week, with a 3.5% aggregate gain. Apple remains the largest company in the group, with a market capitalization of $3.521 billion, followed by Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta. The combined market value of these seven companies is $16.5 trillion, more than the GDP of the Eurozone and 20 times the value of listed companies on the Italian stock exchange.

**Nvidia Briefly Becomes Most Valuable Company in the World**
Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple as the most valuable company in the world on Friday, October 25, due to high demand for its AI chips. Nvidia's market capitalization reached $3.53 trillion, while Apple's was valued at $3.52 trillion, according to data from the London Stock Exchange Group. However, Apple regained its position as the most valuable company later in the day. Nvidia's stock price rose by 1% to $142 per share, while Apple's stock price increased by 0.55% to $231.83. Microsoft is currently in third place with a market capitalization of $3.2 trillion. Nvidia's stock price reached a record high of over $144 per share on Tuesday, October 22, after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, driven by growing demand for chips. Nvidia has become the largest beneficiary of the AI boom, which began after the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI in November 2022, according to CNBC. Large technology companies, including Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, are buying Nvidia's chips in large quantities for their AI-related projects. Nvidia controls around 95% of the market for AI training and inference chips, and its chips account for a significant portion of the multibillion-dollar spending by technology companies on AI development, according to Mizuho. Nvidia's stock price rose in October after CEO Jensen Huang announced that the company's new AI chip, Blackwell, is fully launched and in high demand. In August, Nvidia reported production issues due to the complexity of the chip. Jensen Huang is ranked 11th in the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list, with an estimated net worth of $123.8 billion on October 25.

**US STOCKS-Nasdaq gains as megacap stocks outperform**
The Nasdaq rose on Friday, driven by megacap shares, as Treasury yields slipped from the week's high ahead of quarterly results from some of Wall Street's biggest companies next week. Nvidia briefly overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company based on its shares. However, the Dow slumped on a loss in banking shares, with Goldman Sachs down 2.4%, and a 3% fall in McDonald's as the fast-food chain copes with an E. coli outbreak linked to its hamburgers. Gustaf Little, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments, said, 'There's a lot of moving pieces right now, especially because of where we are in the election cycle, but we think earnings have been pretty good overall.' Investors are still pricing in another 25-basis-point rate cut at the Fed's November meeting and about two rate cuts by the end of the year. 'With such high valuations... at this point, these high growth tech companies need to confirm both AI growth and execution. They need to show and deliver,' said Arnim Holzer, global macro strategist at Easterly EAB Risk Solutions.

**US STOCKS-Nasdaq hits record high as Treasury yields ease**
The Nasdaq hit a fresh intraday record on Friday, driven by megacaps as Treasury yields eased off the week's high. Nvidia briefly overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company by market value, gaining 2.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.19% to 42,292.57, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.51% to 5,839.54. Arnim Holzer, global macro strategist at EAB Investment Group, said, 'The Fed perhaps got a little too dovish ahead of the data... the growth and inflation numbers don't necessarily justify easing behavior.' Investors are still pricing in another 25-basis-point rate cut at the U.S. Federal Reserve's November meeting. The week starting Oct. 28 promises to be crucial for Wall Street, with results from megacap technology firms and the nonfarm payrolls report for October due.

**Nvidia briefly overtakes Apple as world’s most valuable company**
Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable company on Friday, with a market value of $3.53 trillion, according to LSEG data. The tech giant's stock has risen 18% in October, driven by strong demand for its AI chips, particularly after OpenAI's $6.6 billion funding round. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said, 'More companies are now embracing artificial intelligence in their everyday tasks and demand remains strong for Nvidia chips.' Nvidia's shares hit a record high on Tuesday, and the company is expected to report third-quarter results in November, with a forecast revenue of $32.5 billion. Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore remains 'very bullish' about the company's long-term prospects, but notes that the recent rally 'raises the bar for earnings somewhat.'

**Five Stocks, 3 Days, $12 Trillion In Market Cap. Buckle Up.**
The market is bracing for a significant impact from the earnings reports of five megacaps - Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta - which have a combined market valuation of over $12 trillion. These reports will not only affect the S&P 500 and other major indexes but also have a huge influence on the artificial intelligence sector, cloud computing, online advertising, e-commerce, and business software. The stock market rally could experience a significant surge, plunge, or whipsaw as these tech titans report their earnings. Additionally, the presidential election on November 5 and the next Federal Reserve meeting on November 6-7 may also impact the market. Investor caution is likely due to uncertainty over the election, the Fed, and these huge upcoming earnings.

**The Race to a $4 Trillion Market Cap: Apple, Nvidia, or Microsoft**
Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft are the top three companies in the world by market cap, with Apple sitting at $3.6 trillion. Nvidia's market cap is just above $3.5 trillion, thanks to its essential role in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, while Microsoft's market cap is at $3.1 trillion. Apple's AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence, were unveiled at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, but were not ready for the iPhone 16 launch in September. Apple Intelligence will be available on newer iPhones, but hundreds of millions of iPhone owners will need to upgrade their devices to access it. Analyst Dan Ives predicts a 'super cycle' driven by AI interest, which could lead to record iPhone sales of 240 million in fiscal 2025. A stronger-than-expected upgrade cycle and progress toward direct monetization of AI features could propel Apple's stock to the $4 trillion level, but it needs to outperform single-digit percentage revenue growth expectations for next year to justify a $4 trillion valuation.

**Nvidia market cap closing in on $3.5 trillion: Will it surpass Apple soon?**
Nvidia's market capitalization is closing in on $3.5 trillion, with the company adding over $3 trillion since the AI boom began in late 2022. Nvidia's dominance in the AI market is due to its superior technology, with its chips being 25 times more profitable than its closest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices. The company is committed to updating its chips every year, and its new Blackwell chips are already in high demand, with analysts projecting $10 billion in added revenue before the end of the year. Meanwhile, Apple is experiencing growing pains, with reports of less-than-stellar sales of its latest iPhone model. As a result, Nvidia is expected to pull ahead and take the lead position in the race for the world's largest market cap.

He estimates iPhone units will exceed 240 million this year. Ives also notes that there is a 'pent-up upgrade opportunity' for 300 million iPhones that haven't been upgraded in four-plus years, making it a 'multi-year supercycle.' He expects Apple to hit $4 trillion first, followed by Nvidia in mid-2025 and then Microsoft.

**NVIDIA Reaches New High, but Apple Remains the Largest Company**
NVIDIA's stock price has reached a new high, surpassing $140.84 per share, driven by the positive results of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), which reported a 54% increase in net profit. This has fueled optimism in the market, with NVIDIA's stock price rising over 3% and setting a new record. However, Apple remains the largest company in the world by market capitalization, with a value of $3.52 billion. The competition between NVIDIA and Apple will continue, with NVIDIA's stock price needing to reach $143 to surpass Apple's market capitalization. The third-quarter earnings season will be crucial in determining NVIDIA's potential for growth and whether it can overtake Apple. InvestingPro's ProPicks IA tool, which uses artificial intelligence to select stocks, has recommended NVIDIA as a top pick, with a 37.14% return since its launch in November 2023, surpassing the S&P 500 by 16.33%.

The market is optimistic about the possibility of further interest rate cuts in the US, with the Federal Reserve set to meet on November 7th, two days after the US election. Both presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, have promised to stimulate the economy through tax cuts and protect the US market from Chinese companies. While the outcome of the election is uncertain, the market is currently benefiting from the prospect of lower interest rates and protectionist policies. New records for the Dow Jones are therefore seen as a matter of time.

**Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?**
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is rapidly closing the gap with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in terms of valuation, with a market cap of $3.13 trillion compared to Apple's $3.37 trillion. While Apple's revenue is significantly higher at $385 billion, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue, with a 122% year-over-year increase in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Nvidia's growth potential is driven by its graphics processing units (GPUs) powering the AI revolution, and its upcoming Blackwell architecture, which is expected to unlock massive speed gains. Analysts believe Nvidia's revenue will grow around 42% next year, far outpacing Apple's projections of 8% growth. However, Nvidia still generates about half the profits of Apple, but with its growth pace and stronger profit margin, it could quickly catch Apple's profit levels. By the end of the next fiscal year, Nvidia could be right there with Apple in terms of profits. Next comes valuation, where Nvidia's strong growth and brand could fetch a higher premium than Apple, potentially propelling it to overtake Apple as the world's largest company.

Nvidia's AI developments and strategic moves in the tech industry have driven much of the market volatility. According to the article, 'the same market forces that drove huge gains also resulted in some of the largest losses ever.'

**Apple: Enough To Turn The Odds In Its Favor - Still Buy (NASDAQ:AAPL)**
We maintain a positive outlook on Apple for 2025 despite concerns about negative impacts from Huawei's comeback and muted smartphone end demand. Our upgrade note on Apple is based on two factors: 1) the market has recognized the muted smartphone demand and intensified competition on the Chinese front, and 2) better positioning to reverse its lackluster iPhone sales with Apple Intelligence. We expect Apple to dominate the mid-to-high-end smartphone market, with Huawei potentially dominating the high-end market. Apple Intelligence will play a visible role in enhancing Apple's service revenue in FY25. We think Apple should be able to outperform expectations in the December quarter not on real-end demand recovery but on a better iPhone replacement cycle compared to the iPhone 15 lineup due to the added Apple Intelligence feature. We continue to believe Apple is fairly valued considering that the iPhone remains the gold standard for smartphones and Apple is the largest company by market cap. Wall Street remains more bullish on the stock, with 36 out of 48 analysts covering the stock being buy-rated. We expect Apple to take back the title from Samsung in 2025.
