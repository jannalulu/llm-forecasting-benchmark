**Kalshi And Polymarket Shoot To The Top Of Apple's App Store Rankings Amid Election Euphoria - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)**
On the day of the U.S. presidential election, prediction platforms Kalshi and Polymarket reached unprecedented rankings on Apple's App Store. Kalshi, a federally-regulated betting platform, became the number one free app in the 'Finance' category, while Polymarket, a cryptocurrency-based platform, topped the 'Magazine & Newspapers' and 'News' categories. The growth was staggering, with Kalshi rising from 55th to 1st in the free app category and Polymarket jumping from 108th to 2nd in the same category. The surge in interest in predicting election outcomes drove the rankings, with both platforms allowing users to place bets on various election-related markets. Notably, a French 'Trump Whale' known as Theo netted almost $50 million on Polymarket following Trump's victory, while Harris' biggest backer, Redegen, lost around $6.7 million.

**Can Coinbase Stock Double Under a Donald Trump Presidency?**
Coinbase, a leading centralized exchange, has become a popular choice among U.S. investors due to its user-friendly platform and reputation as a reputable exchange for trading cryptocurrencies. Unlike decentralized exchanges, which require technical expertise, Coinbase provides a platform for nearly instant transactions, making it the preferred middleman for most investors. As the company continues to grow, some investors are speculating that a Donald Trump presidency could lead to a doubling of Coinbase stock. However, no specific evidence or expert opinions are mentioned in the article to support this claim.

**Plus Wallet's Popularity Rises, Coinbase Drops & Ethereum Updates**
Market observers, such as Geert Leysen, note that the stock price of Plus Wallet is holding above the trendline tied to Bitcoin's fluctuations. However, others, including trader Cable, are surprised that Coinbase remains below its IPO price of $250 despite positive year-over-year transaction revenue growth. Meanwhile, Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has announced 'The Purge,' a crucial network update that aims to simplify operations, reduce technical debt, and enhance efficiency and scalability by limiting data on individual nodes.

**Kalshi first, Polymarket fourth in financial category of Apple App Store on Election Day**
On Election Day, November 5, 2024, prediction platforms Kalshi and Polymarket reached top spots on the Apple App Store. Kalshi now ranks first in Apple's finance app category and third overall among free apps, while Polymarket is the fourth-highest ranking app in the finance app category. This represents both apps' highest placement to date, likely driven by interest in betting on election outcomes. Kalshi's market for the 2024 U.S. presidential winner, featuring former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, grew to $247 million, while Polymarket maintains $3.26 billion in total betting volume for the same market. Since launching in 2020, Polymarket has amassed $5.15 billion in cumulative trading volume. As a result of a federal court ruling, Kalshi was allowed to list election betting contracts in early October, after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sought to strictly regulate these 'event contracts.'

**Presidential Betting Markets Are a Real-Time Experiment For Regulators—And It Could End Poorly**
Digital betting platforms, such as Kalshi and Polymarket, are experiencing a surge in betting on the upcoming presidential election, with Donald Trump favored to win. However, experts warn that this may not reflect the actual outcome, as betting on political races has not shown predictive validity. Regulators are closely watching the situation, with concerns about liquidity and transparency. Professor Alan Jagolinzer notes that there is a risk of fallout, citing the implosion of FTX two years ago. Analysts have expressed similar concerns about Polymarket's liquidity. Kalshi's co-founder Luana Lopes Lara boasted that $100 million has been wagered on the contest between Kamala Harris and Trump, while CEO Tarek Mansour highlighted the platform's milestone of surpassing Instagram on Apple's App Store's most popular downloads. Hermine Wong, a former lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission, warns that regulators may see a 'worst case scenario' after the election, with potential harm to the public.

**The election-betting market has exploded in popularity this presidential cycle**
The popularity of election-betting platforms has exploded in the 2024 presidential election cycle. Robinhood has launched its own election-betting platform, while Kalshi has seen a surge in popularity and trading volume, with over $100 million in bets placed on the election outcome. Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour said, 'I think we're gunning for No. 1 for the entire App Store by Election Day, so the demand curve truly is exponential.' Polymarket, which is not available to US citizens, has seen a massive increase in trading volume, with nearly $2 billion wagered in October, quadruple the amount wagered in September. However, there has also been scrutiny of the betting itself, with a 'whale' trader placing over $30 million in bets on the outcome of the US election.

**Election Betting Market Explodes in the US**
The market for election betting has exploded during this presidential cycle. Kalshi has attracted $100 million in election bets this month and is the top free financial app on the Apple App Store. Robinhood has also entered the market by announcing its own election betting platform. The popularity of platforms allowing users to bet on politics has surged, with sites like Polymarket and Kalshi allowing users to bet on specific election outcomes. According to Tarek Mansour, CEO of Kalshi, 'I think we're going to hit number one for the entire App Store by election day, so the demand curve is really exponential.' Polymarket, which is not available to American citizens, has seen an explosion in trading volume this year, with nearly $2 billion bet on the site in October, quadruple the $533 million bet in September and over 10 times the $39 million bet in April.

**Crypto.com Overtakes Coinbase as Most Popular US Cryptocurrency Exchange**
Crypto.com has surpassed Coinbase as the most popular cryptocurrency exchange in the US, according to data from 'The Block'. The company's trading volume has skyrocketed this year, reaching $134 billion in September, compared to Coinbase's $46 billion. Crypto.com has maintained its lead in October, with a trading volume of $112 billion, while Coinbase trails behind with $61 billion. Kraken, the third largest exchange, has seen a significant decline in activity, with only $9.8 billion in trading volume. Analysts attribute Crypto.com's popularity to its wide range of tokens, with over 378 available, compared to Coinbase and Kraken's 290 and 290 tokens, respectively. Crypto.com has also filed a lawsuit against the SEC, citing the agency's 'mal-oriented actions' and 'exceeding its authority under the law'. According to Kris Marszalek, the company's CEO, 'these actions are part of the process of operating a legitimate and authorized cryptocurrency business in the US'.

**How to Profit from the US Election on the Cryptocurrency Market**
As the US presidential election on November 5 approaches, investors are looking for ways to profit from the event. One option is to bet on the outcome using platforms like Polymarket, which has gained popularity since the last US election. Despite facing criticism and a $1.4 million fine in 2022 for allowing bets on political events, Polymarket has continued to operate. Recently, the CFTC launched an attack on the prediction platform KalshiEX LLC, but a court ruled in favor of the company, allowing it to offer contracts on its platform. Robinhood has also recognized the potential of betting on the US election and has initiated its own efforts. As a result, Polymarket users in the US may once again be able to place bets on the election. According to Polymarket, the current chance of a Trump win is 65.9%. Investors can also consider investing in cryptocurrency mining companies in the US, as Trump has promised to make the country a leader in this field. Other cryptocurrency options, such as Coinbase and Solana, may also benefit from a Trump presidency. Additionally, PolitiFi-memecoins, which are seen as an alternative to betting, have gained popularity and offer the potential for higher returns. However, some of these coins have already reached high valuations, and new variants may not be as innovative or useful. The project FreeDum Fighters, which combines both Republican and Democratic tokens, has gained traction and raised $332,017 in its presale. Analysts suggest that investing in the PolitiFi-token of Harris could provide a hedge against the dominance of Trump-coins. The $KAMA-coin has seen a 35.8% increase in value over the past week.

**Election betting market Kalshi to take USDC deposits**
Kalshi, a prediction marketplace, will start accepting deposits in USD Coin (USDC), a popular stablecoin, as it competes with other platforms ahead of the United States' November elections. The move comes as Polymarket, a Web3 platform, leads the competition with $2.6 billion riding on the outcome of the presidential election. Kalshi's flagship market, 'Who will win the Presidential election?', has seen nearly $87 million in total betting volume since its listing on October 7. Industry analysts argue that election prediction markets, such as Kalshi, capture public sentiment more accurately than polls. Former President Trump is favored to win the presidency on both Kalshi and Polymarket, with odds of 62% and 66%, respectively. Matthew Sigel, VanEck's head of digital assets research, believes that Bitcoin's performance is creating a 'very bullish setup' for the digital asset as investors brace for the election.

**Robinhood admits it’s just a gambling app**
Robinhood, a financial app, has announced that users can now bet on the outcome of the upcoming US presidential election. The company describes this as 'unlocking a new asset class that democratizes access to events as they unfold.' However, critics argue that this is simply a way to open a betting market, and that the phrase 'democratizes access' is misleading. Robinhood's move comes after a court ruling allowed a similar platform, Kalshi, to offer political event contracts. The article also notes that election markets can be skewed by individual bettors, and that betting markets are not always accurate. Additionally, the article suggests that Robinhood's primary focus is on fun gambling, citing a quote from Bloomberg's Matt Levine: 'Robinhood is the brokerage for fun gambling on meme stocks and meme cryptocurrencies.'

**Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour On The Growing Election Betting Market: 'A Coin Flip With A Bias' - Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD)**
Kalshi's CEO Tarek Mansour described the company's election betting platform as 'a coin flip with a bias,' highlighting its rapid growth to $200 million in trades and overtaking Cash App in U.S. finance app rankings. Mansour noted that Kalshi's election markets reflect user-driven probabilities, distinct from traditional polling data, and offer a transparent and regulated platform for Americans to place bets on the 2024 presidential race. The company's success has led to Robinhood's introduction of election contracts, and other platforms like Interactive Brokers have added election-related products, pointing to an increasing demand for regulated election markets. Kalshi's platform offers nearly 100 election-related markets with substantial liquidity, enabling a broad range of betting options. Mansour emphasized that Kalshi's market allows users to place significantly larger bets without influencing market prices, with average wagers at around $300 to $400. He also envisions prediction markets as an emerging 'source of truth' for public interest topics, from Fed rate decisions to CEO appointments.

**Exclusive: Prediction market Kalshi launches crypto deposits as Trump maintains big lead on betting sites**
Kalshi, a prediction market platform, has launched USDC cryptocurrency deposits, allowing users to load their accounts with a popular cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar. This move aims to make transactions faster and cheaper, and challenge Polymarket's crypto-powered platform, which has gained popularity during the 2024 election cycle. According to Polymarket's website, users have traded $2.6 billion worth of volume on whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris will be elected, while Kalshi has brought in just under $85 million in bets on the presidential race. Kalshi's founder, Tarek Mansour, said that the platform's regulated approach will prove more popular to users, especially with Polymarket cut off to U.S. traders. As of publication, Trump has a 62% chance of winning the presidential election among Kalshi customers, while traditional pollsters are still forecasting the election as a coin flip.

**Robinhood's Election Contracts Spark Competition in Prediction Markets**
Robinhood has launched event contracts that allow users to make predictions on the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election. Following a favorable court ruling, the company will compete with other platforms that offer similar services. The interest in prediction markets has increased, and Robinhood has started to offer limited access to its election contracts. Eligible users, including individual investors who are US citizens and have a margin account or level 2/3 options trading approval, will be able to trade on the likelihood of each candidate winning. The competition among prediction platforms is heating up, with Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour stating that their platform has become the leader in the finance App Store and has surpassed Facebook and Uber in global rankings. Kalshi's average bet size is around $300-400, while some users are creating positions worth millions of dollars. The platform offers much higher liquidity compared to Robinhood. The court's decision in favor of Kalshi is shaping the industry, with other major platforms like Interactive Brokers also entering the election contract market despite CFTC's objections. The value of Robinhood's contracts can reach up to $1, depending on demand, and payments will be made on January 8, 2025. However, the platform does not allow users to hold simultaneous 'Yes' positions for multiple candidates.

**U.S. Election Betting: Kalshi's Polymarket Rival Quickly Gets Traction**
Kalshi, a prediction market platform, has seen significant traction in U.S. election betting, with $30 million in trading volume on its main election contract. Although it trails Polymarket, which has reached $2 billion in trading volume, Kalshi's growth is notable given that it only launched election prediction market contracts in October after a favorable court ruling. As a regulated platform, Kalshi had to wait until it won in court to participate in election betting, whereas Polymarket was able to start earlier.

**CFTC Calls Court Ruling in Kalshi Case an 'Error', Files Appeal**
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed an appeal in the case against Kalshi, a market for predictions. The CFTC believes that the court's previous decision was an 'error' and has asked it to be overturned. The CFTC argues that the court misinterpreted the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, thereby limiting the Commission's authority. The regulator also reiterated its argument that bets on political events are a form of gambling, citing the use of specialized terminology. According to the CFTC, '...the Commission found that contracts can negatively impact the integrity of elections or the perception of election integrity by creating financial incentives for voting (including organized groups) for candidates or by stimulating the spread of disinformation to influence markets, and that markets can be used to influence the perception of elections.' Kalshi's team has not commented on the situation. However, the platform's founder, Tarek Mansour, noted on his X page that Kalshi has surpassed the popularity of Fidelity and Robinhood clients: 'Kalshi just flipped both Robinhood and Fidelity on the Appstore.' In September 2024, the platform won a lawsuit against the CFTC, but the regulator immediately filed an appeal, requesting a temporary ban that prevented the platform from opening bets on political events. This measure was later lifted, but the CFTC's appeal remains in place. Kalshi is currently accepting bets, but this may change in the future pending the upcoming rehearing.

**Bitcoin retail comeback on the cards as Coinbase pierces top-400 apps**
Bitcoin (BTC) is regaining popularity among retail traders, according to new data from Coinbase downloads. The official app from the largest United States exchange, Coinbase, has been among the 500 most downloaded apps on the Apple AppStore, with downloads correlating to price performance. The app reached 385th place on Sept. 28, after a BTC price rebound. Bitcoindata21 explained, 'In other words, more people started downloading the app when bitcoin was testing all time highs.' Despite this, research firm Santiment argued that a new all-time high may still be far off, citing 'positive commentary' tied to Bitcoin at its highest levels year-to-date. 'If you're awaiting Bitcoin's new all-time high, it may need to wait until the crowd slows down their own expectations,' it said. 'There are currently 1.8 bullish posts toward BTC for every 1 bearish post. Markets historically always move the opposite direction of crowd's expectations.'

**Coinbase Popularity Surges in App Store: Bullish?**
Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency platform, has seen a surge in popularity in the App Store, jumping from the 500th to the 395th position in just five days. However, other data suggests that retail investors are not yet back in the crypto market. According to Google Trends, interest in crypto-related searches remains extremely low, with the global metric for the 'crypto' search at 21/100, the lowest since late November 2023. Coinbase's stock price, COIN, added 6.28% and almost touched monthly highs on the NASDAQ exchange, but the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index is targeting near-zero positions as the market takes a breath. As covered by U.Today previously, Coinbase Premium demonstrated a bullish formation this month, but it is too early to say that retail investors are back to crypto.

**CFTC Warns Polymarket and Other Offshore Crypto Betting Platforms of Enforcement Actions**
The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has warned Polymarket and other offshore crypto betting platforms about enforcement actions if they continue to offer unregistered derivatives contracts to U.S. customers. CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam stated, 'We are observing any activity that's occurring offshore and is providing exposure to U.S. customers, and we want to make sure it is done legally and within the bounds of the law.' The agency will take action against platforms with a substantial presence in the U.S. that do not comply with registration requirements. Polymarket had previously settled with the CFTC for $1.4 million in January 2022, but the agency faced a legal setback in its recent lawsuit against Kalshi, a blockchain prediction platform. The CFTC warned about the susceptibility of prediction markets to manipulation, citing examples of recent manipulative actions on competitor platforms. Polymarket's market for the 'Presidential Election Winner 2024' has attracted over $930 million in bets, while its 'Popular Vote Winner 2024' market has seen $208 million in bets placed.
