**Science is finding ways to regenerate people’s hearts, lungs, and internal organs**
Scientists are developing ways to regenerate people's hearts, lungs, and internal organs, which could revolutionize medicine and reverse chronic illnesses. According to the Wall Street Journal, 'It is hard to mend a broken heart, but in a few years doctors might be able to do essentially that.' Researchers are working on various approaches, including using stem cells and microRNA to induce surviving cardiac cells to multiply. A drug developed by Scripps Research scientists has shown promising results in mice and pigs, restoring heart-pumping capacity almost back to normal. Additionally, a 3D-printed windpipe was successfully implanted in a patient, and a gene-edited kidney transplant allowed a monkey to survive for two years. Scientists are also exploring the use of genetically modified pig organs for transplantation, which could be more cost-effective than traditional organ transplants. Furthermore, tiny robots made of human cells are being developed to repair damaged cells, and nanorobots are being used to fight cancer.

**Blind Bulgarian believed to see the future**
Baba Vanga, a blind Bulgarian mystic, made several prophecies that continue to spark interest and debate. According to Vanga, a major conflict in Europe will occur in 2025, exacerbated by tensions between Russia and Ukraine, with severe nuclear implications. She also predicted environmental disasters linked to climate change, including widespread droughts and wildfires. On a hopeful note, Vanga foresaw advancements in lab-grown human organs, which could extend life expectancy and alleviate organ transplant shortages. However, she also warned of a new war breaking out in 2025, threatening Europe's population and potentially triggering a global cataclysm. Vanga claimed that while the end of the world would begin in 2025, complete human extinction would not occur until 5079. Her forecasts also include Europe coming under Muslim rule by 2043 and a return to global communist governance by 2076. Vanga accurately predicted her own death in 1996, further solidifying her legacy as a mystic with predictive powers.

**Developing Liver Tissues in Space for Transplantation on Earth**
Researchers at the University of California are working on developing liver tissues in space, which can be used for transplantation on Earth. The team has made significant progress in this area, and the initial results of the project were announced during the American College of Surgeons' 2024 conference in San Francisco. According to Dr. Tami T. Chang, a professor of surgery at the University of California, 'Our results show that microgravity conditions can develop liver tissues with better features and functions compared to those grown on Earth.' The researchers are using induced pluripotent stem cells to create liver tissues in microgravity. These cells are reprogrammed from normal human cells to resemble embryonic cells, allowing them to differentiate into various cell types. In space, these cells aggregate to form liver-like tissues that are smaller and less complex than natural livers. The microgravity environment allows the cells to aggregate freely without external intervention, resulting in more physiologically accurate tissues. The team has developed a bioreactor called 'Tissue Orb' that mimics the natural blood flow in human tissues, containing artificial blood vessels and an automated system for exchanging nutrients. The researchers are also exploring advanced techniques for preserving the developed tissues in space and returning them to Earth. They are working on developing advanced preservation techniques, including 'ultra-high uniform cryopreservation,' which allows for the preservation of tissues at low temperatures without freezing, without affecting their integrity. This technique can extend the shelf life of engineered tissues, enabling their use in various medical applications, including disease modeling, drug testing, and regenerative medicine. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop effective solutions for preserving tissues that can be used again on Earth, with the hope of addressing the acute shortage of available organs for transplantation and providing new insights into liver diseases.

**Science is finding ways to regenerate your heart**
Scientists are making progress in regenerating human organs, including the heart, lungs, and corneas. Researchers at Scripps Research are working on a drug to grow new heart muscle from surviving heart-muscle cells, while another team is developing a therapeutic to induce surviving cardiac cells to multiply. A third approach involves growing new heart muscle in a lab using stem cells, which can then be injected into a damaged heart. According to Dr. Chuck Murry, director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, 'We're built for performance and not repair.' However, scientists are working to overcome this limitation. For example, Dr. Mauro Giacca is developing a therapeutic that uses microRNA to induce surviving cardiac cells to multiply. Dr. Michael Bollong is working on a drug to grow new heart muscle from surviving heart-muscle cells, which has shown promising results in mice and pigs. The goal is to restore function to the organ and normalize the quality of life of the person. 'We all came from a single cell in our mothers' wombs,' says Bollong. 'We know that those genetic instructions are there for repair.' Clinical trials in humans are already underway to regenerate cells in the lungs, and researchers hope to begin testing the heart regeneration treatments in humans in early 2026.

**Sixth Organ Procurement of 2024 Successfully Completed in Los Ángeles**
The sixth organ procurement of 2024 took place at the 'Dr. Víctor Ríos Ruiz' Complex in Los Ángeles, where a patient who had suffered a tragic traffic accident was able to donate their liver and both kidneys. The patient had expressed their wish to be an organ donor before their death. According to the nurse coordinator, Lucía Estrada, 'we had a patient who had said in life to their family that they wanted to be a donor, and they were able to donate their liver and both kidneys.' The liver was found to be in excellent condition and can be used by up to two people, including a pediatric and an adult recipient. Dr. José Ruíz, a transplant surgeon, stated that 'this is a very important act because it allows the survival of two more people. It's a very charitable act, without any interest. For us, it's super passionate and it makes us feel very proud of what we do.' The sixth procurement of the year has added to the list of available organs for recipients nationwide, and has helped to alleviate the waitlist of over 2,300 people waiting for an organ transplant.

**Cultivating Livers in Space: A Breakthrough for Transplantation**
Scientists from the University of California, San Francisco, are planning to launch an innovative study on the International Space Station (ISS) to cultivate miniature livers in microgravity. This initiative aims to explore whether microgravity can promote the growth of healthy hepatic tissues, potentially opening the door to the creation of personalized organs for transplantation. The study will use induced pluripotent stem cells, which can be reprogrammed to become different types of tissues, including liver cells. The cells will be nourished in a spherical bioreactor called Tissue Orb, designed to mimic a vascular system, allowing the liver organoids to receive the necessary nutrients and develop vascularized tissues. The experiment will be launched on the ISS in early 2025 and will last for two weeks. The liver organoids will then be preserved in a special solution and returned to Earth for analysis. A second experiment, scheduled for 2026, will focus on a novel method of cryopreservation, which could revolutionize the way tissues are transported and used in medical procedures. This breakthrough could provide a valuable alternative to organ transplants, which currently rely on human donors. The demand for liver transplants is high, with thousands of patients waiting for a compatible liver, but the number of donors is insufficient. If the cultivated tissues prove viable and functional, they could provide a solution to this growing need. Additionally, the possibility of cultivating personalized organs could reduce the risk of rejection and improve transplant outcomes, ultimately improving the quality of life for patients.

**Innovative Organ Transportation Technology Breaks Ground in Tirol**
A breakthrough in organ transportation has been achieved by a team of researchers at the Medical University of Innsbruck. They have successfully transported pig kidneys from the US to Tirol using a new transportation technology, which allows organs to be preserved for up to 120 hours. The kidneys were transported at temperatures below freezing point and were still functional after 72 hours. According to Gerald Brandacher, a top medic and transplant researcher, 'Organs can be stored and transported for several days outside the body at temperatures below zero without ice forming.' This technology has the potential to revolutionize organ transplantation and increase the donor pool. 'We can now match organs better, use more complex methods to find the best organ for a recipient, and have a perfect match that lasts longer,' said Brandacher. The team used the XT-ViVo solution in combination with the TimeSeal device to preserve the kidneys. This solution prevents the formation of ice crystals and allows for ice-free preservation of organs between 0 and -20 degrees Celsius. The next step is to conduct clinical trials in 2025 and establish the necessary legal frameworks for global organ exchange.

**Liver Cells Grown in Space Could Revolutionize Organ Transplants**
A new study is testing the ability of human liver cells to self-assemble in microgravity conditions on the International Space Station. The goal of these experiments is to develop tissue engineering solutions that can be used in medical contexts in the future. Researchers believe that the microgravity conditions in low Earth orbit could solve the tissue engineering problems encountered on Earth. The study is working on returning the cells to Earth and continuing the growth process. Dr. Tammy T. Chang, the lead researcher, said that the microgravity conditions enabled the development of liver cells that are better differentiated and functional than those grown on Earth. This breakthrough could be a critical step towards producing liver tissue implants that could be used as an alternative or supportive solution to liver transplants. If the cells can be successfully grown in space, they will need to be safely preserved for return to Earth. Researchers plan to test a technique called isochoric cryogenic cooling, which cools the cells to below their freezing point without causing damage. If this method works, the cells could survive for much longer. Dr. Chang said, 'Our goal is to preserve functional tissues that can be returned to Earth and used for biomedical applications such as disease modeling, drug testing, and therapeutic implantation.'

**Study Reveals Possibility of Growing Human Organs in Space and Re-implanting Them on Earth**
Scientists are working on developing techniques to grow human organs in space and re-implant them on Earth, which could revolutionize liver transplantation. According to Dr. Tami T. Chang, who led the research, 'Our results show that low-gravity conditions enhance the development of liver tissue with better functional properties compared to those grown on Earth.' This is a crucial step towards developing functional liver tissue that can serve as an alternative or complement to traditional liver transplantation. If successful, the technique would involve preserving the grown tissue safely for re-implantation on Earth. Researchers also hope to test a technique called 'isochoric supercooling', which allows materials to be cooled without being damaged. This could significantly extend the lifespan of the tissue, and scientists hope to use it with entire organs in the future. Dr. Chang added, 'We aim to develop effective preservation techniques that enable us to return functional tissue to Earth for use in a variety of biomedical applications, including disease modeling, drug testing, and finally, therapeutic tissue engineering.'

**US Scientists Develop Bioreactor to Grow Liver Tissues in Space**
American scientists have developed a bioreactor that can grow liver tissues and other complex organs in space. The bioreactor will be sent to the International Space Station (ISS) in February 2025 and will be connected to the station. According to Professor Tammy Chang of the University of California, San Francisco, 'Our previous experiments suggest that microgravity can overcome the limitations and obstacles that prevent growing fully functional liver tissues on Earth. The creation of this bioreactor is a critical step towards obtaining viable bioimplants that can serve as an alternative to transplanted livers.' The researchers have been studying the processes involved in forming fully functional body tissues from cultures of reprogrammed stem cells for many years. In space, this growth occurs spontaneously, making the process of growing organs much simpler. The bioreactor is fully automated and can maintain the life of stem cells and stimulate the growth of liver tissues and other organs. The researchers have also developed a set of algorithms that maintain the optimal nutrient environment for tissue growth. If the experiment is successful, the researchers will develop systems, including specialized refrigerators, to transport the grown liver to Earth for implantation in patients.

**Lab-grown blood vessels could soon become reality**
Scientists at Humacyte are making progress in growing lab-grown blood vessels that could replace synthetic grafts made of plastic. The company's technology uses a degradable plastic mesh to create a human artery, which dissolves over two months, allowing the cells to form a blood vessel. The company has already implanted over 500 of its blood vessels in humans and has shown promising results in clinical trials. The lab-grown vessels have been used to treat patients with traumatic injuries, including soldiers in Ukraine, and have shown to be effective in improving blood flow and reducing the need for amputations. Dr. Laura Niklason, chief executive of Humacyte, said, 'This is spare parts for people.' The company is also testing its technology in people undergoing dialysis and those with peripheral artery disease. Dr. Allan Kirk, chairman of the Department of Surgery at Duke University School of Medicine, said, 'The brilliance here is the realization that you don't need to grow the blood vessel, you just need to put the scaffolding down, and the body will do the rest.'

**Scientists Restore Monkey's Vision with Human Stem Cell 'Patch'**
Scientists have successfully treated a complex case of macular hole in a monkey using a 'patch' made from human stem cells. This is a crucial step towards making retinal transplants grown in the lab a reality, as well as offering a more efficient and practical solution for this type of visual pathology. A team of scientists led by Dr. Michiko Mandai, director of the research center at Kobe Eye Hospital in Japan, reported in a new study published in Stem Cell Reports that laboratory-grown retinal tissue transplants from human stem cells successfully repaired macular holes in a monkey, restoring its vision. This is a key advance in the use of these genetic techniques to treat visual impairments related to the retina. Dr. Mandai stated, 'We confirmed for the first time in a non-human primate model that the transplantation of retinal organoid sheet derived from embryonic tail facilitates the closure of macular holes. Our results suggest that this method could become a practical, safe, and effective treatment option with minimal invasive risks, particularly for more complex cases of macular holes.' Macular holes are small holes that form in the macula, the central part of the retina in the eye, resulting in central vision blur or distortion. Although significant advances have been made in surgical techniques in recent years, refractory cases remain a significant challenge to resolve. In the case of degenerative retinal diseases such as macular holes, cell-based therapy is a promising strategy to restore visual function. However, while retinal transplantation allows for good anatomical results, visual improvement is limited, and peripheral visual field defects cannot be avoided. Mandai and his colleagues sought to overcome these obstacles by transplanting retinal organoid sheets derived from human embryonic stem cells. The intervention allowed for the survival and maturation of the graft and the development of light-detecting retinal cells called photoreceptors. Post-operative tests in the treated monkey revealed improvements in eye fixation and light responses. In this way, laboratory-grown retinal organoids from human stem cells become a new hope for surgical solutions to retinal problems. However, according to an article published in Live Science, there are still two major hurdles to overcome: potential immune rejection problems and the fact that it has not yet been confirmed that connections are formed between the transplanted cells and the original cells.

**Xenotransplantation: A Potential Solution to the Organ Shortage?**
In France, 5,634 organ transplants were performed in 2023, a 2.5% increase from the previous year. However, the shortage of organs remains a significant issue, with nearly 11,500 patients on the waiting list and 823 dying due to a lack of a transplant. The xeno-transplantation, or xenograft, which involves replacing a human organ with one from an animal, is being researched as a potential solution. Scientists have made significant progress in this field, particularly with the use of Crispr-Cas9 biotechnology, which allows for the manipulation of living organisms. To overcome the problem of incompatibility between the animal organ and the human immune system, researchers have created 'humanized' pigs by inhibiting certain genes and inserting human genes. These pigs are then used to provide organs for transplantation. The first successful xenotransplantations were performed in 2022 and 2024, with patients receiving a pig heart and kidney, respectively. However, the risks associated with this technology, such as the transmission of animal diseases to humans, are still being evaluated. The economic implications of xenotransplantation, including the high cost of the procedure and the potential threat to the organ donation system, are also being debated. Ultimately, the acceptability of xenotransplantation will depend on the balance between the potential benefits and risks, as well as the social and philosophical implications of this technology.

**Xenografts: The Paris Laboratory that the World Envies**
The Paris-based laboratory, led by Alexandre Loupy, is a hub for analyzing the risks of rejection in xenotransplantation, where an organ from an animal is transplanted into a human. The team has received biopsies from Richard Slayman, a 62-year-old American who received the first pig kidney transplant at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. 'The immunological barrier between species has long been the obstacle for xenotransplantation,' notes Alexandre Loupy. To overcome this, scientists use technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 to 'humanize' the organ and improve compatibility. Although Slayman died two months after the operation, his doctors said there was 'no indication' that his death was related to the transplant. Since 2021, five patients in a coma have received pig kidney transplants, and two others have received pig heart transplants, but both died shortly after. The French laboratory's work is considered essential to this cutting-edge medicine, and Paris hosted the BANFF 2024 conference, where xenotransplantation data will be included in the next edition. 'In ten or fifteen years, xenotransplantation could solve the global shortage of organs,' predicts Alexandre Loupy. 'In France, we hope to have the necessary authorizations to perform the first operations in 2027.'

**Experts Suggest Using Animal Organs for Human Transplants in the Future**
Experts are suggesting that in the future, organs from animals could be transplanted into humans. They also believe that artificial intelligence will play a significant role in organ transplants. According to Prof. Dr. Caner Süsal, Director of Koç University's TIREX, the biggest problem in organ transplants is the shortage of available organs. He stated, 'We have approximately 80,000 to 100,000 people waiting for an organ transplant in Turkey, but we can only perform around 3,500 transplants per year. The gap between the two is growing. To address this issue, we are exploring the possibility of using organs from animals. However, this would require genetic modification. It seems like the time has come to apply this to humans as well. We are discussing the latest developments in organ transplants and what we can achieve in the future. We have participants from 13 countries and 5 continents attending this meeting, and we have managed to bring together the most prominent scientists in the field of organ transplants. We plan to breed animals in farms, genetically modify them, and transplant their organs into humans within the next 10-15 years. If we are successful, everyone will be able to receive an organ transplant.'

**Dr. Jeff Hersh examines recent technological advances in cell and gene therapy**
Over the last 25 years, there have been significant advancements in cell and gene therapy, driven by improved understanding of the human immune system and human DNA. Immunotherapy has led to the development of treatments such as vaccinations, antibody therapies for cancers, and CAR-T therapies, where a patient's T-cells are genetically engineered to target specific cancer cells. The human genome project, completed in 2003, has paved the way for the development of new tests and treatments. Stem cell transplantation has been used to treat genetic diseases, and recent approaches aim to correct protein production in patient's own cells using vectors to implant correctly functioning genes. Gene editing technology, such as CRISPR/Cas9, has been developed and has shown promise in treating diseases such as sickle cell disease. Additionally, genetically modified pig organs have been used in transplantation, with the first pig heart transplant attempt in 2022 and the first pig kidney transplant in 2024. While there have been no long-term successes yet, there is hope that this approach will work in the future.

**Scientists Seek to Rejuvenate Brains with Cultivated Tissue**
A team of scientists, led by Jean Hébert, a renowned biologist, is working on a radical idea to rejuvenate the human brain by replacing aged parts with young tissue grown in a laboratory. This ambitious plan has been funded by the US government's Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), which was established in 2022 to promote transformative innovations in healthcare through massive government funding. Hébert proposes a gradual replacement of the neocortex, the region of the brain responsible for memory and reasoning, without compromising personal identity. He suggests that humans could avoid aging by periodically replacing organs and tissues, like a car's maintenance. Hébert has already conducted preliminary experiments with mice, which have shown promising results. He plans to integrate progressively grown brain tissue into the human brain, starting with small sections. However, the scientific community is divided, with some expressing enthusiasm and others raising concerns about the ethics and feasibility of this approach. Hébert has requested a budget of $110 million to expand his research to larger animals, which he believes is a significant step towards reversing brain aging. While some see this as a potential breakthrough in medicine, others are skeptical about the possibility of fully integrating transplanted brain tissue into an aged brain. The implications of this research are profound, and the debate will likely continue. 'I prefer life to this slow degradation towards non-existence that biology has planned for all of us,' Hébert says. 'We are at a couple of steps away from reversing brain aging,' he adds. 'A couple of big steps, I should say.'

**The Future of Medicine: Creating Organs in the Lab**
Scientists at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and the Instituto D'Or de Pesquisa e Ensino have been working on reprogramming cells to study mental disorders for over a decade. They have successfully transformed cells into neurons and created mini-brains to study factors that can affect brain function. In one study, they isolated cells from the urine of people with schizophrenia and re-created neurons with the disease to better understand the disorder and develop more effective treatments. The researchers have also created organoids, three-dimensional structures that grow in the lab like a miniature brain. Their analysis indicates that the neurons of people with schizophrenia suffer from greater oxidation. The advancements in mini-brain research have opened up new perspectives for exploring questions related to neurodevelopment, such as autism spectrum disorder, and have the potential to change the lives of patients. Additionally, scientists at the Centro de Pesquisa sobre o Genoma Humano e Células-Tronco, linked to the Universidade de São Paulo (USP), are combining cell reprogramming techniques with 3D printing to create mini-livers. This technique, which has been tested by the team, offers hope that in the future, cells from a person's own body can be reprogrammed to build a new organ in the lab, providing an alternative to waiting for a liver transplant and without the risk of rejection.

**Developing Liver Tissues in Space for Transplantation on Earth**
Researchers at the University of California are working on developing liver tissues in space, which can be used for transplantation on Earth. The team has made significant progress in this area, and the initial results of the project were announced during the American College of Surgeons' 2024 conference in San Francisco. According to Dr. Tami T. Chang, a professor of surgery at the University of California, 'Our results show that microgravity conditions can develop liver tissues with better features and functions compared to those grown on Earth.' The researchers are using induced pluripotent stem cells to create liver tissues in microgravity. These cells are reprogrammed from normal human cells to resemble embryonic cells, allowing them to differentiate into various cell types. In space, these cells aggregate to form liver-like tissues that are smaller and less complex than natural livers. The microgravity environment allows the cells to aggregate freely without external intervention, resulting in more physiologically accurate tissues. The team has developed a bioreactor called 'Tissue Orb' that mimics the natural blood flow in human tissues, containing artificial blood vessels and an automated system for exchanging nutrients. The researchers are also exploring advanced techniques for preserving the developed tissues in space and returning them to Earth. They are working on developing advanced preservation techniques, including 'ultra-high uniform cryopreservation,' which allows for the preservation of tissues at low temperatures without freezing, without affecting their integrity. This technique can extend the shelf life of engineered tissues, enabling their use in various medical applications, including disease modeling, drug testing, and regenerative medicine. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop effective solutions for preserving tissues that can be used again on Earth, with the hope of addressing the acute shortage of available organs for transplantation and providing new insights into liver diseases.

**Science is finding ways to regenerate your heart**
Scientists are making progress in regenerating human organs, including the heart, lungs, and corneas. Researchers at Scripps Research are working on a drug to grow new heart muscle from surviving heart-muscle cells, while another team is developing a therapeutic to induce surviving cardiac cells to multiply. A third approach involves growing new heart muscle in a lab using stem cells, which can then be injected into a damaged heart. According to Dr. Chuck Murry, director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, 'We're built for performance and not repair.' However, scientists are working to overcome this limitation. For example, Dr. Mauro Giacca is developing a therapeutic that uses microRNA to induce surviving cardiac cells to multiply. Dr. Michael Bollong is working on a drug to grow new heart muscle from surviving heart-muscle cells, which has shown promising results in mice and pigs. The goal is to restore function to the organ and normalize the quality of life of the person. 'We all came from a single cell in our mothers' wombs,' says Bollong. 'We know that those genetic instructions are there for repair.' Clinical trials in humans are already underway to regenerate cells in the lungs, and researchers hope to begin testing the heart regeneration treatments in humans in early 2026.

**Sixth Organ Procurement of 2024 Successfully Completed in Los Ángeles**
The sixth organ procurement of 2024 took place at the 'Dr. Víctor Ríos Ruiz' Complex in Los Ángeles, where a patient who had suffered a tragic traffic accident was able to donate their liver and both kidneys. The patient had expressed their wish to be an organ donor before their death. According to the nurse coordinator, Lucía Estrada, 'we had a patient who had said in life to their family that they wanted to be a donor, and they were able to donate their liver and both kidneys.' The liver was found to be in excellent condition and can be used by up to two people, including a pediatric and an adult recipient. Dr. José Ruíz, a transplant surgeon, stated that 'this is a very important act because it allows the survival of two more people. It's a very charitable act, without any interest. For us, it's super passionate and it makes us feel very proud of what we do.' The sixth procurement of the year has added to the list of available organs for recipients nationwide, and has helped to alleviate the waitlist of over 2,300 people waiting for an organ transplant.

**Cultivating Livers in Space: A Breakthrough for Transplantation**
Scientists from the University of California, San Francisco, are planning to launch an innovative study on the International Space Station (ISS) to cultivate miniature livers in microgravity. This initiative aims to explore whether microgravity can promote the growth of healthy hepatic tissues, potentially opening the door to the creation of personalized organs for transplantation. The study will use induced pluripotent stem cells, which can be reprogrammed to become different types of tissues, including liver cells. The cells will be nourished in a spherical bioreactor called Tissue Orb, designed to mimic a vascular system, allowing the liver organoids to receive the necessary nutrients and develop vascularized tissues. The experiment will be launched on the ISS in early 2025 and will last for two weeks. The liver organoids will then be preserved in a special solution and returned to Earth for analysis. A second experiment, scheduled for 2026, will focus on a novel method of cryopreservation, which could revolutionize the way tissues are transported and used in medical procedures. This breakthrough could provide a valuable alternative to organ transplants, which currently rely on human donors. The demand for liver transplants is high, with thousands of patients waiting for a compatible liver, but the number of donors is insufficient. If the cultivated tissues prove viable and functional, they could provide a solution to this growing need. Additionally, the possibility of cultivating personalized organs could reduce the risk of rejection and improve transplant outcomes, ultimately improving the quality of life for patients.

**Innovative Organ Transportation Technology Breaks Ground in Tirol**
A breakthrough in organ transportation has been achieved by a team of researchers at the Medical University of Innsbruck. They have successfully transported pig kidneys from the US to Tirol using a new transportation technology, which allows organs to be preserved for up to 120 hours. The kidneys were transported at temperatures below freezing point and were still functional after 72 hours. According to Gerald Brandacher, a top medic and transplant researcher, 'Organs can be stored and transported for several days outside the body at temperatures below zero without ice forming.' This technology has the potential to revolutionize organ transplantation and increase the donor pool. 'We can now match organs better, use more complex methods to find the best organ for a recipient, and have a perfect match that lasts longer,' said Brandacher. The team used the XT-ViVo solution in combination with the TimeSeal device to preserve the kidneys. This solution prevents the formation of ice crystals and allows for ice-free preservation of organs between 0 and -20 degrees Celsius. The next step is to conduct clinical trials in 2025 and establish the necessary legal frameworks for global organ exchange.

**Liver Cells Grown in Space Could Revolutionize Organ Transplants**
A new study is testing the ability of human liver cells to self-assemble in microgravity conditions on the International Space Station. The goal of these experiments is to develop tissue engineering solutions that can be used in medical contexts in the future. Researchers believe that the microgravity conditions in low Earth orbit could solve the tissue engineering problems encountered on Earth. The study is working on returning the cells to Earth and continuing the growth process. Dr. Tammy T. Chang, the lead researcher, said that the microgravity conditions enabled the development of liver cells that are better differentiated and functional than those grown on Earth. This breakthrough could be a critical step towards producing liver tissue implants that could be used as an alternative or supportive solution to liver transplants. If the cells can be successfully grown in space, they will need to be safely preserved for return to Earth. Researchers plan to test a technique called isochoric cryogenic cooling, which cools the cells to below their freezing point without causing damage. If this method works, the cells could survive for much longer. Dr. Chang said, 'Our goal is to preserve functional tissues that can be returned to Earth and used for biomedical applications such as disease modeling, drug testing, and therapeutic implantation.'

**US Scientists Develop Bioreactor to Grow Liver Tissues in Space**
American scientists have developed a bioreactor that can grow liver tissues and other complex organs in space. The bioreactor will be sent to the International Space Station (ISS) in February 2025 and will be connected to the station. According to Professor Tammy Chang of the University of California, San Francisco, 'Our previous experiments suggest that microgravity can overcome the limitations and obstacles that prevent growing fully functional liver tissues on Earth. The creation of this bioreactor is a critical step towards obtaining viable bioimplants that can serve as an alternative to transplanted livers.' The researchers have been studying the processes involved in forming fully functional body tissues from cultures of reprogrammed stem cells for many years. In space, this growth occurs spontaneously, making the process of growing organs much simpler. The bioreactor is fully automated and can maintain the life of stem cells and stimulate the growth of liver tissues and other organs. The researchers have also developed a set of algorithms that maintain the optimal nutrient environment for tissue growth. If the experiment is successful, the researchers will develop systems, including specialized refrigerators, to transport the grown liver to Earth for implantation in patients.

**Scientists Restore Monkey's Vision with Human Stem Cell 'Patch'**
Scientists have successfully treated a complex case of macular hole in a monkey using a 'patch' made from human stem cells. This is a crucial step towards making retinal transplants grown in the lab a reality, as well as offering a more efficient and practical solution for this type of visual pathology. A team of scientists led by Dr. Michiko Mandai, director of the research center at Kobe Eye Hospital in Japan, reported in a new study published in Stem Cell Reports that laboratory-grown retinal tissue transplants from human stem cells successfully repaired macular holes in a monkey, restoring its vision. This is a key advance in the use of these genetic techniques to treat visual impairments related to the retina. Dr. Mandai stated, 'We confirmed for the first time in a non-human primate model that the transplantation of retinal organoid sheet derived from embryonic tail facilitates the closure of macular holes. Our results suggest that this method could become a practical, safe, and effective treatment option with minimal invasive risks, particularly for more complex cases of macular holes.' Macular holes are small holes that form in the macula, the central part of the retina in the eye, resulting in central vision blur or distortion. Although significant advances have been made in surgical techniques in recent years, refractory cases remain a significant challenge to resolve. In the case of degenerative retinal diseases such as macular holes, cell-based therapy is a promising strategy to restore visual function. However, while retinal transplantation allows for good anatomical results, visual improvement is limited, and peripheral visual field defects cannot be avoided. Mandai and his colleagues sought to overcome these obstacles by transplanting retinal organoid sheets derived from human embryonic stem cells. The intervention allowed for the survival and maturation of the graft and the development of light-detecting retinal cells called photoreceptors. Post-operative tests in the treated monkey revealed improvements in eye fixation and light responses. In this way, laboratory-grown retinal organoids from human stem cells become a new hope for surgical solutions to retinal problems. However, according to an article published in Live Science, there are still two major hurdles to overcome: potential immune rejection problems and the fact that it has not yet been confirmed that connections are formed between the transplanted cells and the original cells.

**Revolutionary lab-grown lung tissue set to transform therapies for respiratory diseases and organ transplantation**
Frontier Bio is developing lab-grown human lung tissue as an alternative to animal testing in preclinical drug development. Their technology uses a mixture of cells, including stem cells, combined with biomaterials and bioprinting hardware to produce tissue geometry. The lab-grown lung models develop bronchioles, alveolar air sacs, and beating cilia, and produce mucus and surfactant found in natural lung tissue. According to Victoria-Elisabeth Gruber, Head of Translational Research at Frontier Bio, 'There is an urgent need for more accurate models of lung tissue that allow us to test new therapeutics more effectively than with current methods.' The technology has broad applications, including studying diseases like lung cancer and COVID-19, and creating tissues and organs for transplantation. As Eric Bennett, CEO of Frontier Bio, noted, 'This could fundamentally change the landscape of lung transplants, giving hope to thousands of patients waiting for lifesaving treatment.'

**Xenotransplantation: A Potential Solution to the Organ Shortage?**
In France, 5,634 organ transplants were performed in 2023, a 2.5% increase from the previous year. However, the shortage of organs remains a significant issue, with nearly 11,500 patients on the waiting list and 823 dying due to a lack of a transplant. The xeno-transplantation, or xenograft, which involves replacing a human organ with one from an animal, is being researched as a potential solution. Scientists have made significant progress in this field, particularly with the use of Crispr-Cas9 biotechnology, which allows for the manipulation of living organisms. To overcome the problem of incompatibility between the animal organ and the human immune system, researchers have created 'humanized' pigs by inhibiting certain genes and inserting human genes. These pigs are then used to provide organs for transplantation. The first successful xenotransplantations were performed in 2022 and 2024, with patients receiving a pig heart and kidney, respectively. However, the risks associated with this technology, such as the transmission of animal diseases to humans, are still being evaluated. The economic implications of xenotransplantation, including the high cost of the procedure and the potential threat to the organ donation system, are also being debated. Ultimately, the acceptability of xenotransplantation will depend on the balance between the potential benefits and risks, as well as the social and philosophical implications of this technology.

**Xenografts: The Paris Laboratory that the World Envies**
The Paris-based laboratory, led by Alexandre Loupy, is a hub for analyzing the risks of rejection in xenotransplantation, where an organ from an animal is transplanted into a human. The team has received biopsies from Richard Slayman, a 62-year-old American who received the first pig kidney transplant at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. 'The immunological barrier between species has long been the obstacle for xenotransplantation,' notes Alexandre Loupy. To overcome this, scientists use technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 to 'humanize' the organ and improve compatibility. Although Slayman died two months after the operation, his doctors said there was 'no indication' that his death was related to the transplant. Since 2021, five patients in a coma have received pig kidney transplants, and two others have received pig heart transplants, but both died shortly after. The French laboratory's work is considered essential to this cutting-edge medicine, and Paris hosted the BANFF 2024 conference, where xenotransplantation data will be included in the next edition. 'In ten or fifteen years, xenotransplantation could solve the global shortage of organs,' predicts Alexandre Loupy. 'In France, we hope to have the necessary authorizations to perform the first operations in 2027.'

**Experts Suggest Using Animal Organs for Human Transplants in the Future**
Experts are suggesting that in the future, organs from animals could be transplanted into humans. They also believe that artificial intelligence will play a significant role in organ transplants. According to Prof. Dr. Caner Süsal, Director of Koç University's TIREX, the biggest problem in organ transplants is the shortage of available organs. He stated, 'We have approximately 80,000 to 100,000 people waiting for an organ transplant in Turkey, but we can only perform around 3,500 transplants per year. The gap between the two is growing. To address this issue, we are exploring the possibility of using organs from animals. However, this would require genetic modification. It seems like the time has come to apply this to humans as well. We are discussing the latest developments in organ transplants and what we can achieve in the future. We have participants from 13 countries and 5 continents attending this meeting, and we have managed to bring together the most prominent scientists in the field of organ transplants. We plan to breed animals in farms, genetically modify them, and transplant their organs into humans within the next 10-15 years. If we are successful, everyone will be able to receive an organ transplant.'

**Dr. Jeff Hersh examines recent technological advances in cell and gene therapy**
Over the last 25 years, there have been significant advancements in cell and gene therapy, driven by improved understanding of the human immune system and human DNA. Immunotherapy has led to the development of treatments such as vaccinations, antibody therapies for cancers, and CAR-T therapies, where a patient's T-cells are genetically engineered to target specific cancer cells. The human genome project, completed in 2003, has paved the way for the development of new tests and treatments. Stem cell transplantation has been used to treat genetic diseases, and recent approaches aim to correct protein production in patient's own cells using vectors to implant correctly functioning genes. Gene editing technology, such as CRISPR/Cas9, has been developed and has shown promise in treating diseases such as sickle cell disease. Additionally, genetically modified pig organs have been used in transplantation, with the first pig heart transplant attempt in 2022 and the first pig kidney transplant in 2024. While there have been no long-term successes yet, there is hope that this approach will work in the future.

**Scientists Seek to Rejuvenate Brains with Cultivated Tissue**
A team of scientists, led by Jean Hébert, a renowned biologist, is working on a radical idea to rejuvenate the human brain by replacing aged parts with young tissue grown in a laboratory. This ambitious plan has been funded by the US government's Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), which was established in 2022 to promote transformative innovations in healthcare through massive government funding. Hébert proposes a gradual replacement of the neocortex, the region of the brain responsible for memory and reasoning, without compromising personal identity. He suggests that humans could avoid aging by periodically replacing organs and tissues, like a car's maintenance. Hébert has already conducted preliminary experiments with mice, which have shown promising results. He plans to integrate progressively grown brain tissue into the human brain, starting with small sections. However, the scientific community is divided, with some expressing enthusiasm and others raising concerns about the ethics and feasibility of this approach. Hébert has requested a budget of $110 million to expand his research to larger animals, which he believes is a significant step towards reversing brain aging. While some see this as a potential breakthrough in medicine, others are skeptical about the possibility of fully integrating transplanted brain tissue into an aged brain. The implications of this research are profound, and the debate will likely continue. 'I prefer life to this slow degradation towards non-existence that biology has planned for all of us,' Hébert says. 'We are at a couple of steps away from reversing brain aging,' he adds. 'A couple of big steps, I should say.'

**The Future of Medicine: Creating Organs in the Lab**
Scientists at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and the Instituto D'Or de Pesquisa e Ensino have been working on reprogramming cells to study mental disorders for over a decade. They have successfully transformed cells into neurons and created mini-brains to study factors that can affect brain function. In one study, they isolated cells from the urine of people with schizophrenia and re-created neurons with the disease to better understand the disorder and develop more effective treatments. The researchers have also created organoids, three-dimensional structures that grow in the lab like a miniature brain. Their analysis indicates that the neurons of people with schizophrenia suffer from greater oxidation. The advancements in mini-brain research have opened up new perspectives for exploring questions related to neurodevelopment, such as autism spectrum disorder, and have the potential to change the lives of patients. Additionally, scientists at the Centro de Pesquisa sobre o Genoma Humano e Células-Tronco, linked to the Universidade de São Paulo (USP), are combining cell reprogramming techniques with 3D printing to create mini-livers. This technique, which has been tested by the team, offers hope that in the future, cells from a person's own body can be reprogrammed to build a new organ in the lab, providing an alternative to waiting for a liver transplant and without the risk of rejection.

**Science is finding ways to regenerate people’s hearts, lungs, and internal organs**
Scientists are developing ways to regenerate people's hearts, lungs, and internal organs, which could revolutionize medicine and reverse chronic illnesses. According to the Wall Street Journal, 'It is hard to mend a broken heart, but in a few years doctors might be able to do essentially that.' Researchers are working on various approaches, including using stem cells and microRNA to induce surviving cardiac cells to multiply. A drug developed by Scripps Research scientists has shown promising results in mice and pigs, restoring heart-pumping capacity almost back to normal. Additionally, a 3D-printed windpipe was successfully implanted in a patient, and a gene-edited kidney transplant allowed a monkey to survive for two years. Scientists are also exploring the use of genetically modified pig organs for transplantation, which could be more cost-effective than traditional organ transplants. Furthermore, tiny robots made of human cells are being developed to repair damaged cells, and nanorobots are being used to fight cancer.

**Developing Liver Tissues in Space for Transplantation on Earth**
Researchers at the University of California are working on developing liver tissues in space, which can be used for transplantation on Earth. The team has made significant progress in this area, and the initial results of the project were announced during the American College of Surgeons' 2024 conference in San Francisco. According to Dr. Tami T. Chang, a professor of surgery at the University of California, 'Our results show that microgravity conditions can develop liver tissues with better features and functions compared to those grown on Earth.' The researchers are using induced pluripotent stem cells to create liver tissues in microgravity. These cells are reprogrammed from normal human cells to resemble embryonic cells, allowing them to differentiate into various cell types. In space, these cells aggregate to form liver-like tissues that are smaller and less complex than natural livers. The microgravity environment allows the cells to aggregate freely without external intervention, resulting in more physiologically accurate tissues. The team has developed a bioreactor called 'Tissue Orb' that mimics the natural blood flow in human tissues, containing artificial blood vessels and an automated system for exchanging nutrients. The researchers are also exploring advanced techniques for preserving the developed tissues in space and returning them to Earth. They are working on developing advanced preservation techniques, including 'ultra-high uniform cryopreservation,' which allows for the preservation of tissues at low temperatures without freezing, without affecting their integrity. This technique can extend the shelf life of engineered tissues, enabling their use in various medical applications, including disease modeling, drug testing, and regenerative medicine. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop effective solutions for preserving tissues that can be used again on Earth, with the hope of addressing the acute shortage of available organs for transplantation and providing new insights into liver diseases.

**Science is finding ways to regenerate your heart**
Scientists are making progress in regenerating human organs, including the heart, lungs, and corneas. Researchers at Scripps Research are working on a drug to grow new heart muscle from surviving heart-muscle cells, while another team is developing a therapeutic to induce surviving cardiac cells to multiply. A third approach involves growing new heart muscle in a lab using stem cells, which can then be injected into a damaged heart. According to Dr. Chuck Murry, director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, 'We're built for performance and not repair.' However, scientists are working to overcome this limitation. For example, Dr. Mauro Giacca is developing a therapeutic that uses microRNA to induce surviving cardiac cells to multiply. Dr. Michael Bollong is working on a drug to grow new heart muscle from surviving heart-muscle cells, which has shown promising results in mice and pigs. The goal is to restore function to the organ and normalize the quality of life of the person. 'We all came from a single cell in our mothers' wombs,' says Bollong. 'We know that those genetic instructions are there for repair.' Clinical trials in humans are already underway to regenerate cells in the lungs, and researchers hope to begin testing the heart regeneration treatments in humans in early 2026.

**Sixth Organ Procurement of 2024 Successfully Completed in Los Ángeles**
The sixth organ procurement of 2024 took place at the 'Dr. Víctor Ríos Ruiz' Complex in Los Ángeles, where a patient who had suffered a tragic traffic accident was able to donate their liver and both kidneys. The patient had expressed their wish to be an organ donor before their death. According to the nurse coordinator, Lucía Estrada, 'we had a patient who had said in life to their family that they wanted to be a donor, and they were able to donate their liver and both kidneys.' The liver was found to be in excellent condition and can be used by up to two people, including a pediatric and an adult recipient. Dr. José Ruíz, a transplant surgeon, stated that 'this is a very important act because it allows the survival of two more people. It's a very charitable act, without any interest. For us, it's super passionate and it makes us feel very proud of what we do.' The sixth procurement of the year has added to the list of available organs for recipients nationwide, and has helped to alleviate the waitlist of over 2,300 people waiting for an organ transplant.

**Cultivating Livers in Space: A Breakthrough for Transplantation**
Scientists from the University of California, San Francisco, are planning to launch an innovative study on the International Space Station (ISS) to cultivate miniature livers in microgravity. This initiative aims to explore whether microgravity can promote the growth of healthy hepatic tissues, potentially opening the door to the creation of personalized organs for transplantation. The study will use induced pluripotent stem cells, which can be reprogrammed to become different types of tissues, including liver cells. The cells will be nourished in a spherical bioreactor called Tissue Orb, designed to mimic a vascular system, allowing the liver organoids to receive the necessary nutrients and develop vascularized tissues. The experiment will be launched on the ISS in early 2025 and will last for two weeks. The liver organoids will then be preserved in a special solution and returned to Earth for analysis. A second experiment, scheduled for 2026, will focus on a novel method of cryopreservation, which could revolutionize the way tissues are transported and used in medical procedures. This breakthrough could provide a valuable alternative to organ transplants, which currently rely on human donors. The demand for liver transplants is high, with thousands of patients waiting for a compatible liver, but the number of donors is insufficient. If the cultivated tissues prove viable and functional, they could provide a solution to this growing need. Additionally, the possibility of cultivating personalized organs could reduce the risk of rejection and improve transplant outcomes, ultimately improving the quality of life for patients.

**Innovative Organ Transportation Technology Breaks Ground in Tirol**
A breakthrough in organ transportation has been achieved by a team of researchers at the Medical University of Innsbruck. They have successfully transported pig kidneys from the US to Tirol using a new transportation technology, which allows organs to be preserved for up to 120 hours. The kidneys were transported at temperatures below freezing point and were still functional after 72 hours. According to Gerald Brandacher, a top medic and transplant researcher, 'Organs can be stored and transported for several days outside the body at temperatures below zero without ice forming.' This technology has the potential to revolutionize organ transplantation and increase the donor pool. 'We can now match organs better, use more complex methods to find the best organ for a recipient, and have a perfect match that lasts longer,' said Brandacher. The team used the XT-ViVo solution in combination with the TimeSeal device to preserve the kidneys. This solution prevents the formation of ice crystals and allows for ice-free preservation of organs between 0 and -20 degrees Celsius. The next step is to conduct clinical trials in 2025 and establish the necessary legal frameworks for global organ exchange.

**Liver Cells Grown in Space Could Revolutionize Organ Transplants**
A new study is testing the ability of human liver cells to self-assemble in microgravity conditions on the International Space Station. The goal of these experiments is to develop tissue engineering solutions that can be used in medical contexts in the future. Researchers believe that the microgravity conditions in low Earth orbit could solve the tissue engineering problems encountered on Earth. The study is working on returning the cells to Earth and continuing the growth process. Dr. Tammy T. Chang, the lead researcher, said that the microgravity conditions enabled the development of liver cells that are better differentiated and functional than those grown on Earth. This breakthrough could be a critical step towards producing liver tissue implants that could be used as an alternative or supportive solution to liver transplants. If the cells can be successfully grown in space, they will need to be safely preserved for return to Earth. Researchers plan to test a technique called isochoric cryogenic cooling, which cools the cells to below their freezing point without causing damage. If this method works, the cells could survive for much longer. Dr. Chang said, 'Our goal is to preserve functional tissues that can be returned to Earth and used for biomedical applications such as disease modeling, drug testing, and therapeutic implantation.'

**Study Reveals Possibility of Growing Human Organs in Space and Re-implanting Them on Earth**
Scientists are working on developing techniques to grow human organs in space and re-implant them on Earth, which could revolutionize liver transplantation. According to Dr. Tami T. Chang, who led the research, 'Our results show that low-gravity conditions enhance the development of liver tissue with better functional properties compared to those grown on Earth.' This is a crucial step towards developing functional liver tissue that can serve as an alternative or complement to traditional liver transplantation. If successful, the technique would involve preserving the grown tissue safely for re-implantation on Earth. Researchers also hope to test a technique called 'isochoric supercooling', which allows materials to be cooled without being damaged. This could significantly extend the lifespan of the tissue, and scientists hope to use it with entire organs in the future. Dr. Chang added, 'We aim to develop effective preservation techniques that enable us to return functional tissue to Earth for use in a variety of biomedical applications, including disease modeling, drug testing, and finally, therapeutic tissue engineering.'

**US Scientists Develop Bioreactor to Grow Liver Tissues in Space**
American scientists have developed a bioreactor that can grow liver tissues and other complex organs in space. The bioreactor will be sent to the International Space Station (ISS) in February 2025 and will be connected to the station. According to Professor Tammy Chang of the University of California, San Francisco, 'Our previous experiments suggest that microgravity can overcome the limitations and obstacles that prevent growing fully functional liver tissues on Earth. The creation of this bioreactor is a critical step towards obtaining viable bioimplants that can serve as an alternative to transplanted livers.' The researchers have been studying the processes involved in forming fully functional body tissues from cultures of reprogrammed stem cells for many years. In space, this growth occurs spontaneously, making the process of growing organs much simpler. The bioreactor is fully automated and can maintain the life of stem cells and stimulate the growth of liver tissues and other organs. The researchers have also developed a set of algorithms that maintain the optimal nutrient environment for tissue growth. If the experiment is successful, the researchers will develop systems, including specialized refrigerators, to transport the grown liver to Earth for implantation in patients.

**Scientists to Send Bioreactor to ISS for Liver Tissue Growth**
American scientists have developed an innovative bioreactor that allows for the automated growth of liver tissue and other complex organs in microgravity conditions. The bioreactor, which includes artificial analogs of blood vessels and complex algorithms for controlling the nutrient medium, will be sent to the International Space Station (ISS) in February 2025. According to research, liver tissue can develop more efficiently in weightlessness, avoiding the difficulties encountered on Earth. The goal is to grow miniature versions of the liver on the ISS, which can perform vital functions such as blood purification. The success of this experiment will be a step towards creating bioimplants that can serve as an alternative to liver transplantation in the future. If successful, scientists plan to develop systems for delivering organs to Earth for subsequent implantation. As Dr. [no quote from the article], the bioreactor is a crucial step in advancing our understanding of tissue growth in space.

**Ukraine's Quest for Peace: Can the War be Ended by 2025?**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that the war in Ukraine can only be ended with a strong position, repeating his message during his recent visit to European capitals. Catherine Rémy, a researcher, has published a book on the development of xenotransplantation, the transplantation of organs between different species, including between animals and humans. Despite numerous attempts, non-human organs have not been successfully transplanted into humans. Zelensky has expressed his desire to end the war by 2025, but the West is struggling to mobilize support, with Germany reducing its military aid to Ukraine by half. Zelensky's 'Plan for Victory' aims to secure renewed support from Western allies by offering a prospect of an end to the war. 'The Ukraine can only negotiate with a strong position,' Zelensky reiterated during his visit to European capitals.

**Lab-grown blood vessels could soon become reality**
Scientists at Humacyte are making progress in growing lab-grown blood vessels that could replace synthetic grafts made of plastic. The company's technology uses a degradable plastic mesh to create a human artery, which dissolves over two months, allowing the cells to form a blood vessel. The company has already implanted over 500 of its blood vessels in humans and has shown promising results in clinical trials. The lab-grown vessels have been used to treat patients with traumatic injuries, including soldiers in Ukraine, and have shown to be effective in improving blood flow and reducing the need for amputations. Dr. Laura Niklason, chief executive of Humacyte, said, 'This is spare parts for people.' The company is also testing its technology in people undergoing dialysis and those with peripheral artery disease. Dr. Allan Kirk, chairman of the Department of Surgery at Duke University School of Medicine, said, 'The brilliance here is the realization that you don't need to grow the blood vessel, you just need to put the scaffolding down, and the body will do the rest.'

**Scientists Restore Monkey's Vision with Human Stem Cell 'Patch'**
Scientists have successfully treated a complex case of macular hole in a monkey using a 'patch' made from human stem cells. This is a crucial step towards making retinal transplants grown in the lab a reality, as well as offering a more efficient and practical solution for this type of visual pathology. A team of scientists led by Dr. Michiko Mandai, director of the research center at Kobe Eye Hospital in Japan, reported in a new study published in Stem Cell Reports that laboratory-grown retinal tissue transplants from human stem cells successfully repaired macular holes in a monkey, restoring its vision. This is a key advance in the use of these genetic techniques to treat visual impairments related to the retina. Dr. Mandai stated, 'We confirmed for the first time in a non-human primate model that the transplantation of retinal organoid sheet derived from embryonic tail facilitates the closure of macular holes. Our results suggest that this method could become a practical, safe, and effective treatment option with minimal invasive risks, particularly for more complex cases of macular holes.' Macular holes are small holes that form in the macula, the central part of the retina in the eye, resulting in central vision blur or distortion. Although significant advances have been made in surgical techniques in recent years, refractory cases remain a significant challenge to resolve. In the case of degenerative retinal diseases such as macular holes, cell-based therapy is a promising strategy to restore visual function. However, while retinal transplantation allows for good anatomical results, visual improvement is limited, and peripheral visual field defects cannot be avoided. Mandai and his colleagues sought to overcome these obstacles by transplanting retinal organoid sheets derived from human embryonic stem cells. The intervention allowed for the survival and maturation of the graft and the development of light-detecting retinal cells called photoreceptors. Post-operative tests in the treated monkey revealed improvements in eye fixation and light responses. In this way, laboratory-grown retinal organoids from human stem cells become a new hope for surgical solutions to retinal problems. However, according to an article published in Live Science, there are still two major hurdles to overcome: potential immune rejection problems and the fact that it has not yet been confirmed that connections are formed between the transplanted cells and the original cells.

**Revolutionary lab-grown lung tissue set to transform therapies for respiratory diseases and organ transplantation**
Frontier Bio is developing lab-grown human lung tissue as an alternative to animal testing in preclinical drug development. Their technology uses a mixture of cells, including stem cells, combined with biomaterials and bioprinting hardware to produce tissue geometry. The lab-grown lung models develop bronchioles, alveolar air sacs, and beating cilia, and produce mucus and surfactant found in natural lung tissue. According to Victoria-Elisabeth Gruber, Head of Translational Research at Frontier Bio, 'There is an urgent need for more accurate models of lung tissue that allow us to test new therapeutics more effectively than with current methods.' The technology has broad applications, including studying diseases like lung cancer and COVID-19, and creating tissues and organs for transplantation. As Eric Bennett, CEO of Frontier Bio, noted, 'This could fundamentally change the landscape of lung transplants, giving hope to thousands of patients waiting for lifesaving treatment.'

**Xenotransplantation: A Potential Solution to the Organ Shortage?**
In France, 5,634 organ transplants were performed in 2023, a 2.5% increase from the previous year. However, the shortage of organs remains a significant issue, with nearly 11,500 patients on the waiting list and 823 dying due to a lack of a transplant. The xeno-transplantation, or xenograft, which involves replacing a human organ with one from an animal, is being researched as a potential solution. Scientists have made significant progress in this field, particularly with the use of Crispr-Cas9 biotechnology, which allows for the manipulation of living organisms. To overcome the problem of incompatibility between the animal organ and the human immune system, researchers have created 'humanized' pigs by inhibiting certain genes and inserting human genes. These pigs are then used to provide organs for transplantation. The first successful xenotransplantations were performed in 2022 and 2024, with patients receiving a pig heart and kidney, respectively. However, the risks associated with this technology, such as the transmission of animal diseases to humans, are still being evaluated. The economic implications of xenotransplantation, including the high cost of the procedure and the potential threat to the organ donation system, are also being debated. Ultimately, the acceptability of xenotransplantation will depend on the balance between the potential benefits and risks, as well as the social and philosophical implications of this technology.

**Xenografts: The Paris Laboratory that the World Envies**
The Paris-based laboratory, led by Alexandre Loupy, is a hub for analyzing the risks of rejection in xenotransplantation, where an organ from an animal is transplanted into a human. The team has received biopsies from Richard Slayman, a 62-year-old American who received the first pig kidney transplant at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. 'The immunological barrier between species has long been the obstacle for xenotransplantation,' notes Alexandre Loupy. To overcome this, scientists use technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 to 'humanize' the organ and improve compatibility. Although Slayman died two months after the operation, his doctors said there was 'no indication' that his death was related to the transplant. Since 2021, five patients in a coma have received pig kidney transplants, and two others have received pig heart transplants, but both died shortly after. The French laboratory's work is considered essential to this cutting-edge medicine, and Paris hosted the BANFF 2024 conference, where xenotransplantation data will be included in the next edition. 'In ten or fifteen years, xenotransplantation could solve the global shortage of organs,' predicts Alexandre Loupy. 'In France, we hope to have the necessary authorizations to perform the first operations in 2027.'

**Experts Suggest Using Animal Organs for Human Transplants in the Future**
Experts are suggesting that in the future, organs from animals could be transplanted into humans. They also believe that artificial intelligence will play a significant role in organ transplants. According to Prof. Dr. Caner Süsal, Director of Koç University's TIREX, the biggest problem in organ transplants is the shortage of available organs. He stated, 'We have approximately 80,000 to 100,000 people waiting for an organ transplant in Turkey, but we can only perform around 3,500 transplants per year. The gap between the two is growing. To address this issue, we are exploring the possibility of using organs from animals. However, this would require genetic modification. It seems like the time has come to apply this to humans as well. We are discussing the latest developments in organ transplants and what we can achieve in the future. We have participants from 13 countries and 5 continents attending this meeting, and we have managed to bring together the most prominent scientists in the field of organ transplants. We plan to breed animals in farms, genetically modify them, and transplant their organs into humans within the next 10-15 years. If we are successful, everyone will be able to receive an organ transplant.'

**Dr. Jeff Hersh examines recent technological advances in cell and gene therapy**
Over the last 25 years, there have been significant advancements in cell and gene therapy, driven by improved understanding of the human immune system and human DNA. Immunotherapy has led to the development of treatments such as vaccinations, antibody therapies for cancers, and CAR-T therapies, where a patient's T-cells are genetically engineered to target specific cancer cells. The human genome project, completed in 2003, has paved the way for the development of new tests and treatments. Stem cell transplantation has been used to treat genetic diseases, and recent approaches aim to correct protein production in patient's own cells using vectors to implant correctly functioning genes. Gene editing technology, such as CRISPR/Cas9, has been developed and has shown promise in treating diseases such as sickle cell disease. Additionally, genetically modified pig organs have been used in transplantation, with the first pig heart transplant attempt in 2022 and the first pig kidney transplant in 2024. While there have been no long-term successes yet, there is hope that this approach will work in the future.

**Scientists Seek to Rejuvenate Brains with Cultivated Tissue**
A team of scientists, led by Jean Hébert, a renowned biologist, is working on a radical idea to rejuvenate the human brain by replacing aged parts with young tissue grown in a laboratory. This ambitious plan has been funded by the US government's Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), which was established in 2022 to promote transformative innovations in healthcare through massive government funding. Hébert proposes a gradual replacement of the neocortex, the region of the brain responsible for memory and reasoning, without compromising personal identity. He suggests that humans could avoid aging by periodically replacing organs and tissues, like a car's maintenance. Hébert has already conducted preliminary experiments with mice, which have shown promising results. He plans to integrate progressively grown brain tissue into the human brain, starting with small sections. However, the scientific community is divided, with some expressing enthusiasm and others raising concerns about the ethics and feasibility of this approach. Hébert has requested a budget of $110 million to expand his research to larger animals, which he believes is a significant step towards reversing brain aging. While some see this as a potential breakthrough in medicine, others are skeptical about the possibility of fully integrating transplanted brain tissue into an aged brain. The implications of this research are profound, and the debate will likely continue. 'I prefer life to this slow degradation towards non-existence that biology has planned for all of us,' Hébert says. 'We are at a couple of steps away from reversing brain aging,' he adds. 'A couple of big steps, I should say.'

**The Future of Medicine: Creating Organs in the Lab**
Scientists at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and the Instituto D'Or de Pesquisa e Ensino have been working on reprogramming cells to study mental disorders for over a decade. They have successfully transformed cells into neurons and created mini-brains to study factors that can affect brain function. In one study, they isolated cells from the urine of people with schizophrenia and re-created neurons with the disease to better understand the disorder and develop more effective treatments. The researchers have also created organoids, three-dimensional structures that grow in the lab like a miniature brain. Their analysis indicates that the neurons of people with schizophrenia suffer from greater oxidation. The advancements in mini-brain research have opened up new perspectives for exploring questions related to neurodevelopment, such as autism spectrum disorder, and have the potential to change the lives of patients. Additionally, scientists at the Centro de Pesquisa sobre o Genoma Humano e Células-Tronco, linked to the Universidade de São Paulo (USP), are combining cell reprogramming techniques with 3D printing to create mini-livers. This technique, which has been tested by the team, offers hope that in the future, cells from a person's own body can be reprogrammed to build a new organ in the lab, providing an alternative to waiting for a liver transplant and without the risk of rejection.
