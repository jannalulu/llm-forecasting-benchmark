**Expect 'biggest Thanksgiving box office in over a decade': Expert**
The box office has seen a significant boost with the opening of 'Wicked' and 'Gladiator II', which grossed a combined $170 million in their opening weekend. According to Box Office Guru founder and editor Gitesh Pandya, this is exactly what the box office needed this year, citing the pandemic and double strikes as major disruptions. Pandya notes that the outlook for the fourth quarter and 2025 is good, and with Disney's 'Moana 2' coming out this week, he predicts that the Thanksgiving box office will be the 'biggest in over a decade'. 'Wicked' did 'fantastic', and 'Gladiator II' did 'really well', with good reviews and audience metrics. Pandya believes that this will lead to a strong holiday season, with people coming back to the theaters to see upcoming releases.

**This movie can save cinema from having, for the first time in history, the top 10 of the year be all sequels**
The 2024 box office is dominated by sequels, with all the top 10 highest-grossing movies being part of a franchise. However, the release of 'Wicked', an adaptation of the Broadway musical, may change this trend. According to the article, 'Wicked' has the potential to enter the top 10, which would be a 'small glimmer of hope for Hollywood'. However, it's worth noting that the movie will be released in two parts, which may not exempt it from being part of the sequel trend. As the article states, '2024 is not a bad year for cinema, but after such curious phenomena as those we experienced in 2023, it is marking a return to the festival of sequels that the box office has become today.'

**Moviegoers all 'Glicked' about November blockbusters**
The domestic box office has seen a significant boost this weekend, with 'Wicked' and 'Gladiator II' combining to gross an estimated $169.5 million in their domestic debut. According to Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, the success of the two films can be attributed to their quality and the appeal of their vastly different genres. 'Wicked' got off to a hot start, surpassing Disney's 'Into the Woods' as the biggest opening weekend for a musical adaptation of a Broadway show, while 'Gladiator II' set a record as the biggest November opening day for an R-rated film. Dergarabedian credits the year's success to the diversity in genres and the industry's ability to rebound from the SAG-AFTRA strikes. He expects the overall domestic box office to surpass the $8 billion mark by the end of the year.

The upcoming release of 'Wicked,' 'Gladiator II,' and 'Moana 2' on November 22 and 27, respectively, is expected to break Thanksgiving weekend box office records. According to Deadline, 'Wicked' is predicted to earn $125-150 million in its domestic opening weekend, while 'Gladiator II' is expected to gross over $60 million.

'Moana 2' is predicted to gross between $125 million and $150 million for the five-day holiday weekend domestically, which would break records for the time period. As noted by The Hollywood Reporter, the early Wednesday opening of 'Moana 2' could contribute to its strong expectations.

**Can Wicked and Gladiator 2 Reverse the Box Office Decline?**
The box office has seen a decline in recent months due to several film failures after a successful winter. However, two star-studded films, Wicked and Gladiator 2, are expected to reverse the trend and generate excitement in theaters before the holidays. Gladiator 2 is already in theaters, while Wicked is set to release on Thursday, November 21, with early access screenings on Wednesday. According to Deadline, Wicked is projected to earn $100 million in its opening weekend, a significant increase from the previous forecast of $80-85 million in its first three days. Meanwhile, Variety estimates that Gladiator 2 will earn $65 million in its opening weekend in the US, while Deadline projects $55-65 million. Gladiator 2 has already earned $87 million in international markets, in line with Deadline's projections. Wicked has secured the second-best pre-sale ticket sales for a film this year, behind only Deadpool & Wolverine, the second-highest-grossing film of the year. The 2024 box office has been a rollercoaster, with few successes and more high-budget flops. While films like Dune 2 and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire stood out in the early months, big-budget failures like Profession: Danger and Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga failed to turn a profit with budgets over $150 million. The industry performed better in winter, thanks to the three biggest hits of the year: Intensely 2, Deadpool & Wolverine, and My Favorite Villain 4. However, spring brought another challenging time for the box office, as expected hits like Joker: Folie à Deux and Venom: The Last Dance failed to meet projections, and the top-grossing film of the past weekend, Code: Red Suit, earned only $34 million with a $250 million budget. The top 10 films in the US did not exceed $100 million in a single weekend in September, a feat achieved every weekend between mid-June and mid-August. Wicked and Gladiator 2 are being compared to the Barbenheimer phenomenon of last year, when Barbie and Oppenheimer dominated the winter box office, becoming the number 1 and number 3 highest-grossing films of the year, respectively. 'It won't happen the same way, but the conversation around Wicked and Gladiator reminds me of Barbenheimer,' said Shawn Robbins, director of cinematic analysis at Fandango, noting that the films are 'feeding off each other.' Tom Nunan, a film professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told CNN that the two films 'will feed off each other,' but likely won't have the same momentum as Barbenheimer, citing Wicked's limited appeal as a musical and the stories being familiar to the audience. Paul Mescal, the star of Gladiator 2, compared the two films to the Barbenheimer phenomenon, dubbing the double feature of this year 'Glicked.' Wicked and Gladiator 2 are expected to receive Oscar nominations for Best Picture, with many publications, including Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, and Entertainment Weekly, predicting that Wicked will lead the pack with nine nominations. Wicked features a star-studded cast, including Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, and is directed by Jon M. Chu. Gladiator 2 is directed by Ridley Scott and stars Paul Mescal, Denzel Washington, and Pedro Pascal. The box office is expected to continue its recovery next week with the release of Moana 2, which is projected to be one of the highest-grossing animated films of the year. Deadline predicts that Moana 2 could eclipse the success of Intensely 2, the highest-grossing film of the year. The CEO of AMC, Adam Aron, said in a quarterly earnings presentation earlier this month that 'experts believe Moana 2 could surpass even the success of Intensely 2.' Between Moana 2 and the second weekend of Wicked and Gladiator 2, Deadline expects the next weekend to be the highest-grossing in the US.

**'Red One' Will Be a Small Appetizer for Theaters to the Box Office Feast Ahead**
Amazon MGM's Christmas action film 'Red One' starring Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans is projected to have a $30 million opening, but box office projections suggest it will be a small appetizer before the bigger releases of Universal's 'Wicked' and Paramount's 'Gladiator II' next weekend. The 2024 domestic box office is currently 12% behind last year's pace, but is expected to narrow the deficit thanks to the upcoming releases, including Disney's 'Moana 2' which is projected to have a $135 million extended launch, potentially the biggest five-day opening ever.

**The 2024 Box Office Is On Track To Break A Massive Hollywood Trend & It's Really Disappointing**
The 2024 box office is on track to break a recent Hollywood trend by not reaching the $9 billion domestic box office revenue of 2023. With a current domestic box office revenue of $6,802,253,425, 2024 is projected to finish under 2023's year-end total of $8,908,478,987. Several upcoming releases, including Gladiator II, Wicked: Part One, and Moana 2, may help boost the domestic box office, but it's unlikely they will make up the $2 billion deficit. The 2025 slate is expected to surpass both 2024 and 2023 with releases such as Avatar 3, Jurassic World Rebirth, and James Gunn's Superman film.

**Painting the town pink and green: 'Wicked' takes over retail ahead of theatrical debut**
The upcoming film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical 'Wicked' is expected to generate significant revenue from merchandise sales, according to a report by Mintel. The report found that nearly half of 'superfans' have spent money on official fandom events or merchandise in the past year. Retailers partnering with Universal are expected to see a boost from sales of 'Wicked' merchandise, which could help them stand out from other companies. The limited-time nature of these merchandise collaborations may also drive demand, as consumers may be willing to spend to get these products before they vanish from shelves. Movie theaters are also offering themed merchandise, such as popcorn buckets and drink specials, to capitalize on the film's release. Box-office analysts have a wide-ranging read on what 'Wicked' could do during its domestic opening weekend, with predictions ranging from $85 million to $150 million in its first three days in theaters.

AMC CEO Adam Aron believes Moana 2 has the potential to outgross Inside Out 2 at the box office.

Inside Out 2 opened to $155 million domestically and $295 million globally, while Moana 2 is expected to gross between $75 million and $82 million domestically in its opening weekend. To surpass Inside Out 2, Moana 2 would need to become the biggest hit of 2024, which is a challenging task considering Inside Out 2 has already grossed $1.697 billion worldwide and $652 million domestically. Moana 2, directed by David Derrick Jr., Jason Hand, and Dana Ledoux Miller, opens in theaters on November 27, 2024.

This would mean surpassing the $653 million achieved by the sequel of 'Inside Out' in the domestic market, with $154.2 million of them in its opening weekend, making it the second-best release of the year, just behind 'Deadpool y Lobezno', which made $211.4 million in its first weekend.

**Hollywood Bets on Thanksgiving Rebound: Will ‘Wicked,’ ‘Gladiator II’ and ‘Moana 2’ Revive the Sluggish Fall Box Office?**
The box office is looking for a rebound this Thanksgiving season with the releases of 'Wicked', 'Gladiator II', and 'Moana 2'. According to Shawn Robbins, Fandango's director of movie analytics, 'Wicked' and 'Gladiator II' are 'fueling each other', much like the 'Barbenheimer' phenomenon. The films are projected to open solidly, with 'Wicked' aiming for $80 million to $85 million, 'Gladiator II' looking to bring in $55 million to $65 million, and 'Moana 2' likely targeting above $100 million. Cinema operators are hoping that these films will help salvage a lackluster year at the movies, with overall domestic box office revenues down more than 11% from 2023 and nearly 27% from 2019. Chris Aronson, president of domestic distribution for Paramount, says, 'There's a lack of momentum going into Thanksgiving, but the marketplace works when there's something for everyone — and this Thanksgiving there's something for everyone.'

**'Joker: Folie À Deux' Opening Weekend May Be 2024 Box Office Punch-Line**
Despite high expectations, the comic book sequel Joker: Folie à Deux is expected to underperform on its opening weekend, with a predicted domestic gross of $45-55 million. The film's poor reception, as indicated by a 38% Rotten Tomatoes score and 37% audience score, has led to a significant drop in tracking numbers. The film's marketing campaign has been criticized for hiding its musical elements and co-lead nature of Joaquin Phoenix's Joker and Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn. A worst-case scenario could see the film's total gross at around $300 million, while a more moderate outcome could put it at around $600 million. However, this would still be a significant disappointment compared to the original Joker's billion-dollar performance. The film's success will depend on its international performance, particularly in China, and its ability to maintain a strong word-of-mouth. A B+ Cinemascore would be a good indicator of the film's chances, but a B or lower would likely lead to a worst-case outcome.

This is a decline from the first film's $96 million opening, but still a satisfactory result, especially compared to other musical films. It's possible that the film may struggle to reach the $1 billion mark at the global box office, but with a budget of $200 million, director Todd Philips is likely to bring home a profit. According to Philips, 'the film's success will depend on how well it connects with audiences.'

**Divertida Mente 2 Breaks Records on Disney+ with 30.5 Million Views**
The animated film 'Divertida Mente 2' has broken records on Disney+, with 30.5 million views worldwide in its first five days of release. This makes it the biggest opening of 2024 on the platform, the largest opening for a film released in theaters since 'Encanto' (2021), and the biggest launch of all time in the regions of Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. With 153.6 million subscribers worldwide, the streaming service has seen high engagement with the 'Divertida Mente' franchise. Since the release of the first teaser for the sequel, the original 2015 animation has also seen a significant increase in views, totaling over 121 million views. The film had already broken records before its streaming release, reaching $1 billion at the global box office in just 19 days, making it the fastest animation to reach this value. The total box office revenue of $1.7 billion surpassed 'Frozen 2', making it the highest-grossing animated film of all time. Currently, 'Divertida Mente 2' is the highest-grossing film of 2024 and the only animated film to have surpassed $1 billion in international markets (excluding North American box office). The 'Divertida Mente' universe will continue to expand on Disney+ with the release of the series 'Produção de Sonhos' on December 11, which will explore the department that creates Riley's dreams. The series will have a documentary-style format and will feature the return of the original characters from Riley's head: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust - but for now, only Anxiety, Boredom, Shame, and Envy.
