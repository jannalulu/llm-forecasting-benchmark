**The report states that the global mobile game market is expected to reach US$98.7 billion in 2024, with China leading the way.**
The 2024 Autumn Game Industry Report predicts the global mobile game market will reach US$98.7 billion in 2024, with China leading the way with revenue of US$34.6 billion. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6.4% from 2024 to 2027, reaching US$118.9 billion by 2027. Asia is the largest mobile gaming market, with revenue expected to grow from US$65 billion to US$77 billion. In-app purchases are also expected to grow, with global consumer spending reaching $171 billion in 2023, led by China with US$52.1 billion. Women account for 64% of in-app purchase users, and 87% of users play mobile games at least once a week. Google Play is the most popular app store, with 25.6 billion user downloads in the first quarter of 2024, but the App Store remains stronger in generating revenue. Investment activity increased in the first half of 2024, with investment volume exceeding US$2 billion in both quarters, almost double the amount invested in 2023.

**You can make ChatGPT your default search engine in Chrome. Here's how**
ChatGPT Search is a more efficient search engine that combines conversational queries with real-time internet access. It can now be made the default search engine in Chrome. ChatGPT Search includes in-line citations, a 'sources' button, and additional search result links. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman calls the feature 'really good' and encourages users to subscribe to ChatGPT Plus, which costs $20 per month and comes with other perks. To make the switch, users can download the free Chrome extension and visit the ChatGPT Search page on the Chrome web store.

**Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): A Top Contender in Video Conferencing Stocks with Google Meet's Robust Growth**
The video conferencing market has experienced significant growth since the COVID-19 pandemic, with the market valued at $4.21 billion in 2020, $7 billion in 2022, and $28.61 billion in 2023. The market is projected to grow from $33.04 billion in 2024 to $60.17 billion by 2032, indicating a compound annual growth rate of 7.8%. According to a report by Grand View Research, the market growth was initially driven by the pandemic and lockdowns, but is now driven by the rise in remote jobs and e-learning. A report by Pew Research found that 35% of the US workforce was working remotely in 2023, up 7% from pre-pandemic years. The North America region held the largest market share in 2023, while the Asia Pacific region is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR due to growing interest in digitalization.

**Desperate Microsoft Will Pay $1,000,000 to Someone Who Actually Uses Bing**
Microsoft is offering a $1,000,000 prize to users who actually use Bing, its search engine, in an attempt to increase its market share. The competition, which started last month, also offers $10,000 prizes for ten other winners. However, despite its efforts, Bing still lags behind Google, which has a 90% global market share and $175 billion in global search revenues. Microsoft's search market share has only increased from 2.8% to 3.4% between 2023 and 2024, and its AI integration efforts, such as Bing AI ChatGPT, have not resulted in a significant bump in market share. According to StatCounter, Bing accounts for 4.15% of global searches. As one commentator noted, 'when all else fails, why not literally pay people money out the wazoo to use your product?'

**Google Pixel 9 Surpasses Samsung in US Market Share**
According to Statcounter data relayed by Android Authority, Google's market share in the US has tripled from 4.6% in September to 12.9% in October 2024, surpassing Samsung's market share by nearly half. Meanwhile, Apple's market share decreased by nearly 4% over the same period. This significant increase suggests that Google's efforts to attract new users are bearing fruit. However, it's worth noting that Statcounter's data is collected from a tracking code installed on over 1.5 million websites worldwide, which may have some limitations, but the large sample size makes the results relatively reliable and representative of Google's global progress in the smartphone market.

**Google's Dominance in Search Market Erodes as Meta and Amazon Gain Ground**
Google's dominance in the search market is waning. Meta Platforms is working on its own search engine, powered by artificial intelligence, to reduce its dependence on Google and Microsoft Bing. According to Reuters, Meta's new web crawler will rely on Meta AI, which is already driving a chatbot used on WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook. This move will fuel competition in the search market, with Google's Gemini AI model already integrated into its search engine and Microsoft using OpenAI's KI-technology for its Bing co-pilot. Amazon is also making inroads, with its search market share growing faster than Google's in the US, according to eMarketer. Amazon's share of search advertising revenue is expected to rise to 22.3% in the US this year, while Google's share will decline to 50.5%. For 2025, eMarketer predicts that Google will lose its majority share of the US search advertising market. Additionally, companies like Marcapo and Hase & Igel are investing in AI and marketing technology to improve their offerings and compete with Google.

**Google Pixel had an almost unbelievable month, according to market share data**
According to Statcounter's data, Google's market share in the US increased from 4.6% in 2023 to 12.9% in October 2023, a threefold increase. This surge could potentially cut into Samsung's and Apple's market share, with Apple experiencing a 4% downturn. However, it's essential to note that this data is based on tracking code installed on over 1.5 million sites globally, which may not be as accurate as direct sales or user data. Despite this, the large sample size suggests that these findings are likely mostly accurate, as Statcounter explains on its FAQ page.

**Can Google Keep Up with OpenAI's SearchGPT?**
The rise of OpenAI's SearchGPT has posed a significant challenge to Google's dominance in the search engine market. According to a recent report by Statista, Google currently holds around 92 percent of the global search engine market share. However, users are growing tired of traditional keyword-based search results, often littered with ads and SEO-driven manipulation. The competition between OpenAI's SearchGPT and Google Search is expected to be intense, with the stakes being search dominance in a world where users are seeking more relevant and accurate results. As one might say, 'the game has changed' and it remains to be seen whether Google can keep up with the competition.

**Google's Dominance in Search Engine Market Challenged by New Competitors**
Google's dominance in the search engine market is being challenged by new competitors, including Amazon and Meta. According to a report by Alexa, Google's market share in the US has dropped to 91.1% in June 2024, its lowest level in over a decade. The company's AI-powered search feature, AI Overviews, has been met with mixed reactions, with some users praising its ability to provide accurate and relevant results, while others have criticized its reliance on artificial intelligence and its tendency to prioritize automated responses over human input. Meanwhile, Microsoft's Bing search engine has been gaining ground, with a 7.27% market share in the US, making it the second-largest search engine in the world. Yahoo, another long-time competitor, is also making a comeback, with a new design and features that aim to attract both old and new users. The report also highlights the growing importance of local search engines, such as Baidu in China and Yandex in Russia, which have carved out a niche for themselves in their respective markets. As the search engine landscape continues to evolve, users are being presented with a wider range of options, and the competition is driving innovation and improvement in the quality of search results.

**Google's Dominance in Online Search Advertising Under Threat**
Google's share of the US online search advertising market is expected to drop below 50% by 2025 for the first time in over a decade, according to eMarketer. This development comes as the US Department of Justice has hinted at the possibility of breaking up Google to end its monopoly on search. While it may take years for any concrete action to be taken, the argument that the market is changing could play a role. Amazon is already gaining ground in the advertising market, with a projected 24.2% share next year, as users increasingly search for products directly on the e-commerce platform. Other players, such as TikTok and Perplexity, a startup backed by Jeff Bezos, are also emerging as potential competitors, with TikTok allowing businesses to target ads based on user requests and Perplexity planning to integrate advertising into its AI platform. As Google's market share declines, the company's lawyers may be taking note, with one source reportedly printing out the statistic and hanging it on the wall of their office, according to Corriere della Sera. 'The market is changing,' said the source, 'and we need to adapt.'

**Google's Market Share in Search Engine Market Expected to Decline to 48% by 2025**
According to a study by a research company, Google's market share in the search engine market is expected to decline to 48% by 2025. This is the first time in decades that Google will not dominate the majority of the search market in the US. Despite this, Google will remain the largest player in the search market, holding a 48% share of search ad revenue in the US. However, Amazon is growing faster and is expected to surpass Google's market share in the search ad market. Amazon is expected to control around 27% of search ad revenue in the US by 2026, while Google's share will decline. This does not mean that users will have to switch to Bing or Yahoo, as this does not mean the end of Google or anything close to it. Google is still the fourth-largest company in the world in terms of market value, with a value of $2.1 trillion. The company remains dominant in other markets, including display advertising, which it leads alongside Meta, the parent company of Facebook and YouTube. Each of these companies is larger than Delta Air Lines' entire market value, so Google will not disappear. However, Google faces several threats, including antitrust lawsuits. A federal judge in San Francisco recently ruled that Google must open its Play Store to competitors, dealing a significant blow to the company in its long-running battle with Epic Games. Google has said it will appeal the ruling. In August, the company lost another ruling when a federal court found that Google was engaging in anti-competitive behavior in the search market, which could ultimately lead to the breakup of the company's search business. There is another antitrust battle underway, with Google being accused of abusing its dominance in the online advertising market. At the same time, European regulatory bodies have forced Google to comply with new, strict rules, and its violations have resulted in multiple fines exceeding $1 billion. TikTok has also entered the search market, and Amazon has done something that few other large technology companies have been able to do, using Google to sell its own products and then selling ads to other companies to promote their products on Google. In the US alone, Amazon is expected to generate $27.8 billion in search ad revenue in 2025, second only to Google's $62.9 billion.

**Google Loses Ground in Search Ads to Amazon, TikTok, and AI**
Google's dominance in the search ad market, valued at nearly $300 billion, is at risk. According to a recent WSJ report, the company's market share could fall below 50% by 2025, a first in over a decade. The causes of this transformation are emerging competitors and artificial intelligence (AI), which have changed the dynamics of how and where users search. Amazon and TikTok are among the main rivals, with Amazon increasing its market share significantly by attracting more advertisers who want to capitalize on the trend of users starting their searches directly on their platform. TikTok has also started allowing search-based ads, capturing the attention of a young audience that now searches for not only entertainment but also information and products. The role of AI is also key in this change, with tools like Perplexity providing direct answers to user questions, rather than lists of links like Google. This not only saves time but also presents new forms of advertising, where advertisers can sponsor follow-up questions, integrating into the conversation in a natural and targeted way. Google has tried to adapt by introducing AI-generated summaries in its search results, although this strategy has not been well received by all users. Additionally, the company faces a more complicated landscape after losing an antitrust case in the US, where it was accused of illegally monopolizing the search engine market.

**Google’s search dominance is unwinding**
Google's dominance in the US search market is unwinding, according to a forecast by eMarketer. For the first time in decades, Google will not control a majority of the US search market next year, with a 48% share of American search advertising revenue. Amazon is growing faster, with a 24% share of US search ad dollars, which is expected to grow to 27% in 2026. Google is still growing its sales in the space, but faces multiple threats to its business, including antitrust regulators and competition from Amazon and TikTok. Google has been forced to comply with strict new rules in Europe and has faced multiple $1 billion-plus fines. The company is also facing a challenge from AI, with OpenAI's ChatGPT and Apple's partnership with OpenAI threatening to upend the search market. Google is working on its own AI technology, Gemini, but its success is by no means secured. A Google spokesperson pointed to a company blog post announcing ads in its AI overviews, saying it can capitalize on a changing marketplace. However, the company's long-held phrase, 'Competition is one click away,' now feels closer to reality. Google is not in threat of vanishing, but all massively dominant companies have a reckoning of some sort over time.

**Google Is Losing Ground to Unexpected Rivals in Search Ad Revenue and Name Popularity, According to New Estimates**
Google's dominance in search ad revenue and name popularity is waning, according to new estimates. The company's share of the $88.8 billion U.S. search advertising market is expected to drop below 50% next year, the lowest in over a decade, as competitors like Amazon, Perplexity AI, and TikTok gain ground. 'Consumers are conducting product searches through Amazon and social media searches through TikTok, with targeted ads creating revenue for each business along the way,' according to a Wall Street Journal report. Meanwhile, Gen Z is barely using the term Google as a verb, instead 'searching' through social media, Amazon, and ChatGPT. Google's AI Overviews now display ads with relevant products under a 'sponsored' banner, but the company's numbers remain strong, with a share of the overall search market at least 90%.

**Google's Dominance in Search Advertising Threatened by TikTok and AI**
Google's dominance in the search advertising market is being threatened by the rise of new technologies. According to The Wall Street Journal, both TikTok and AI companies are poised to enter this market soon. TikTok, a short video app popular among young people, has started to offer advertisers the ability to target users based on their searches, similar to Google's model. Some advertisers have already tested this feature, committing to spend at least $10,000 per month for two months, and have seen positive results, particularly in the electronics, clothing, and beauty industries. Despite having only 3.4% market share in digital advertising in the US, TikTok is expected to see its ad revenue increase by 38.1% by the end of this year, with an estimated global daily search volume of over 3 billion. Another potential threat to Google's dominance is Perplexity, an AI startup backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, which plans to start showing ads in its search results by October. The company has already processed over 340 million searches, with 46% of them leading to additional questions, showing the potential for its model to reach a wider audience. According to the publication, Google's market share in search advertising in the US is expected to fall below 50% for the first time in over a decade by 2025, with TikTok, AI, and Amazon posing a threat to its dominance.

Google's dominance in the $300 billion search advertising market is under pressure due to emerging rivals like TikTok and AI startups. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google's U.S. search ad market share is forecast to fall below 50% for the first time in more than a decade by 2024.

Google continues to evolve its search platform, incorporating AI-generated summaries and ads into its mobile searches. However, advertisers are increasingly looking for alternatives, with digital advertising executive Nii Ahene stating, 'for the first time in probably 15 years, we will have viable alternatives to Google.' Google's vice president overseeing search ads, Brendon Kraham, said, 'We're confident in this approach to monetizing our AI-powered experiences,' but the increasing competition and ongoing legal battles paint a complex picture for the future of Google's grip on the market.

**Google's Dominance on Digital Advertising Market Erodes Amid Growing Competition**
Google is gradually losing its dominant position on the digital advertising market due to growing competition from other companies and social media platforms. According to eMarketer, Google's revenue will increase by 7.6% by the end of the year, but its market share will drop from 50.5% to 48.3% by 2025. Amazon, which currently holds the second spot, is expected to reach 24.2% market share by 2025, with a 17.6% increase in ad revenue. Competitors are increasingly using new advertising tools, particularly AI, to gain market share from Google. Social media platforms, including Meta and TikTok, are also developing and offering new targeting options to brands. This comes after a US court ruling in August that Google had abused its dominant position to maintain a monopoly on search engines and ad placement.

**Google's Dominance in Online Advertising Market May Decline Due to AI and TikTok**
According to a US analysis, Google's share of the online advertising market could fall below 50% by 2025. Competitors are using AI models for targeted ads. A forecast by eMarketer has sparked discussions in the advertising industry, suggesting that Google's market power in online ads could decline to below 50% next year. This would still be a significant lead over Amazon, which is expected to account for around 22% of ad revenue in 2024. Google's market share has been declining for years. The Wall Street Journal has spoken with analysts and companies who agree that there will be significant changes due to artificial intelligence and advertising directly on online platforms. Amazon's growth, which has been steadily eroding Google's market share since 2020, is largely driven by ads on Amazon itself. Consumers are increasingly searching for products on Amazon first, rather than using a search engine. The platforms are increasingly tailoring ads to the user's profile, similar to what Google has always done. TikTok is reportedly offering its large advertisers the ability to play ads based on a user's previous search queries. Google is also working with machine learning, showing some users summaries of text from search results directly on the search page. Google's Chief of Ads for Search, Brendon Kraham, said, 'We were already at a point where we had to deal with such changes.' The competition in the estimated $300 billion market for ads in online searches is not only coming from established platforms like Amazon and TikTok, but also from a new AI startup, Perplexity AI, which is backed by Jeff Bezos. Perplexity AI will soon start serving ads, allowing advertisers to precisely control how their brand is represented in the search engine's responses. Perplexity AI differs from traditional search engines in that it provides text summaries with images and diagrams for complex search queries.
