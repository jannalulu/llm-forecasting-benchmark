**Quantum computers may soon outclass traditional ones, says IBM fellow Jay Gambetta**
IBM Fellow Jay M. Gambetta believes that quantum computers may outperform classical ones on specific tasks, achieving the 'quantum advantage', within the next couple of years. However, this will require improving the hardware and platform, as well as developing new algorithms for these systems. Gambetta stated, 'We've reached a point where our quantum computers can be simulated using classical computers. This stage is what we refer to as quantum utility.' He emphasized that this doesn't imply the existence of an algorithm that outperforms classical methods. Gambetta explained that IBM has surpassed 100 qubits and 3,000 quantum gates, and is putting significant effort into enhancing Qiskit, their software platform. He added that the next challenge lies in scaling to larger, cost-effective systems, and that users won't need to worry about error correction once it's in place. Gambetta also highlighted the importance of developing reliable heuristic algorithms, and that IBM is working on a new metric called error per layered gate (EPLG) to evaluate how well circuits are compiled from abstract to physical form. The company plans to demonstrate error correction on the Starling processor by 2029 and release the BlueJay processor by 2033. Gambetta emphasized the need for 'modular cryogenics, advanced Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)-based controls, and dense quantum interconnects' to push technological boundaries.
