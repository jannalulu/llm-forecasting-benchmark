The agreement also includes a five-year renewal option. Despite a temporary disruption in March due to the Key Bridge Collapse, Carnival has continued to operate out of Baltimore, creating over 400 jobs and generating $1 million in economic impact per cruise. Governor Wes Moore stated, 'Maryland's cruising industry creates over 400 jobs — 220 of which are based at the port.' Carnival has been sailing out of Baltimore for 20 years, offering cruises to destinations like the Bahamas, Bermuda, Turks and Caicos, St. Maarten, and the Virgin Islands.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 06:57 PM\nSource:[wmar2news.com](https://www.wmar2news.com/local/carnival-cruise-lines-will-continue-sailing-out-of-baltimore-for-at-least-5-more-years)\n\n**Can We Schedule an Intercity Taxi in Advance?**\nIntercity ride-sharing has emerged as a flexible and contemporary alternative to traditional taxi services, allowing passengers to set and negotiate prices with drivers. This approach provides a dynamic pricing structure, enabling passengers to influence their travel costs actively. By booking an intercity ride in advance, passengers can secure guaranteed availability, lower prices, and more precise travel planning. However, it's essential to consider factors such as cancellation policies, reliability, and flexibility when choosing a ride-sharing platform. Intercity ride-sharing services offer a more personalized approach than traditional taxis, allowing passengers to negotiate fares and customize their travel experience according to their needs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 06:03 AM\nSource:[NORTHEAST NOW](https://nenow.in/automobile/can-we-schedule-an-intercity-taxi-in-advance.html)\n\n**GM Cruise Rival Waymo AVs Now In Operation Throughout Los Angeles**\nWaymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, has launched its driverless cab service, Waymo One, in Los Angeles, California, offering 24/7 rides throughout the city. The service has seen a positive response, with 98% of surveyed riders expressing satisfaction and 96% finding it useful. Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said, 'Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride.' The service area covers nearly 80 square miles and will be gradually expanded. Waymo has also partnered with local community organizations to make transportation safer and more accessible, including a nonprofit called She is Hope, which empowers single mothers in LA. Founder Tisha Janigan said, 'Riding with Waymo was an incredible experience – smooth, safe, and truly impressive.' The news comes as the Los Angeles Auto Show is set to take place from November 22nd to December 1st, with Waymo as the official ride-hail partner.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 12:05 PM\nSource:[gmauthority.com](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2024/11/gm-cruise-rival-waymo-avs-now-in-operation-throughout-los-angeles/)\n\n**Waymo Opens Ride-Hailing Services In Los Angeles**\nWaymo has expanded its driverless robotaxi service, Waymo One, to all residents in Los Angeles. The service, which offers 24/7 fully autonomous rides, was initially launched in a limited capacity in March 2024 and had over 300,000 people sign up for the waitlist. Waymo One has now been made available in over 80 sq miles of LA County, with riders giving the service an average rating of 4.7/5 stars. Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said, 'Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride.' The expansion is part of Waymo's plan to grow its service area and cover more of the city in the future. Waymo is one of the leading players in the driverless robotaxi sector, with competitors including GM's Cruise, Tesla, and Amazon's Zoox.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 12:50 PM\nSource:[silicon.co.uk](https://www.silicon.co.uk/mobility/mobile-apps/waymo-opens-ride-hailing-services-in-los-angeles-588693)\n\n**Waymo Launches Autonomous Ride-Hailing Service in Los Angeles**\nWaymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, announced on Tuesday that its autonomous ride-hailing service, Waymo One, is now available to the general public in Los Angeles, marking a rapid growth and adoption of the technology. The company raised $5.6 billion in funding last month, as automakers and tech companies are betting big on autonomous driving technology, despite facing strict regulatory scrutiny. Waymo said that nearly 300,000 people have joined its waitlist since it began commercial operations in Los Angeles earlier this year, indicating strong demand. 'Our service has matured quickly, and our passengers are adopting the many benefits of fully autonomous driving,' said Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo. Waymo, based in Mountain View, California, is a pioneer in autonomous driving technology and launched its first driverless taxi service in the US in 2020, more than a decade after it was born as a project within Google. Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, said in October that the electric vehicle manufacturer will launch autonomous ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas next year, indicating growing competition in the autonomous ride-hailing market. Cruise, a General Motors subsidiary, is testing cars with safety drivers after an accident last year forced it to remove all vehicles from the roads. Meanwhile, Zoox, an Amazon subsidiary, is expanding tests of its wheel-less and pedal-less vehicles.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 04:11 PM\nSource:[Terra](https://www.terra.com.br/byte/waymo-da-alphabet-abre-servico-de-carona-autonoma-para-publico-geral-em-los-angeles,3c576de26c025c8004326267d261d12cvl9nzuif.html)\n\n**Independence to suspend bus services in 2025, citizens concerned with IRIS replacement**\nThe city of Independence will discontinue its free bus service on December 31, 2024, due to a lack of federal COVID-19 relief funding. The city plans to implement IRIS micro-transit, a ride-sharing program, within city limits, charging a flat rate of $5 per ride. However, daily riders are concerned that the proposed five cars with IRIS will not meet the demand of nearly 300,000 bus rides provided annually. The city will pay $420,000 for the six-month trial program, while riders will contribute $60,000 through the $5 fare. Independence city leaders will evaluate the program's efficiency after June 30, 2025. 'Introducing those fares, it does keep our transit costs within our budgeted amounts,' said Tom Scannell, community development director. 'I don't understand at all how it's going to soak up demand from all these folks who have to get places day in and day out,' said Anthony Cunningham, a daily rider. 'We have the ability to scale up if all of a sudden the city of Independence decides they undershot with five cars; we can add four, five, 10 more cars the next day,' said Terry O'Toole, president of KC operations with WHC Worldwide, the company which owns IRIS.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 04:23 AM\nSource:[kshb.com](https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/independence-to-suspend-bus-services-in-2025-citizens-concerned-with-iris-replacement)\n\n**Everything We Know So Far About the Disney Adventure, Set to Sail From Singapore in December 2025**\nThe Disney Adventure, a new Disney Cruise Line ship, will set sail from Singapore in December 2025.

Trump has vowed to repeal President Biden's executive order on AI, which established a regulatory framework for generative AI, citing concerns that it hinders innovation. AI leaders, including OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anthropic's Jack Clark, have expressed optimism about the new administration's approach, citing the need for the US to maintain its lead in developing AI with democratic values. However, some experts, such as Dan Hendrycks, Director for the Center of AI Safety, have cautioned that the new administration's policies will need to balance Musk's past safety positions with those of running mate J.D. Vance, who has supported open-source technology. The Trump administration's AI policies will also need to address issues such as chips and export controls, which are likely to become key economic pillars under Trump. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 11:30 AM\nSource:[forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahemerson/2024/11/08/ai-startups-investors-eagerly-await-less-red-tape-under-trump/)\n\n**Forrester's Predictions 2025: Navigating the Future of IT and Security**\nAccording to Forrester's Predictions 2025 report, companies will need to balance pragmatism and audacity in a landscape marked by increasing technological complexity. The adoption of AIOps will triple in response to technical debt, while pressure for return on investment may slow down AI projects. TuringBots will accelerate software development, and private clouds will see a resurgence, but compliance with regulations such as the EU's AI Act will present new challenges for organizations. By 2026, 75% of technology decision-makers will see their technical debt increase to a moderate or high level of severity. This is due to the rapid development of AI solutions, which are increasing the complexity of computer environments. Forrester predicts that leaders in IT will triple the adoption of AI platforms for IT operations (AIOps) in 2025, which offer contextually aware data to improve human judgment, automatically solve incidents, and improve business results. However, the success of AIOps implementation depends on a suitable organizational culture, data architecture, and security practices. The report also warns that the pressure to show quick results may lead some companies to reduce their funding in AI, which would be detrimental in the long term. It is recommended to prioritize differentiated use cases that leverage specific company data and align with a long-term strategy. Additionally, Forrester predicts that 30% of development teams will accelerate their software development life cycle (SDLC) using TuringBots, AI-powered development tools that go beyond coding and testing, automating processes such as creating requirement documents and managing product comments through text and video analysis. The EU's AI Act is expected to come into force in 2025, and Forrester anticipates that a provider of AI generative will receive the first fine for non-compliance. Companies will need to be cautious, evaluating their AI generative providers and ensuring they collect the necessary evidence to avoid regulatory sanctions. As companies seek to control their data and comply with data sovereignty regulations, private cloud computing is expected to experience a resurgence. However, organizations are looking for alternatives to VMware due to recent price and licensing changes. Forrester predicts that demand for private cloud services will increase in parallel with the growth of public cloud, driven by alternative providers such as Nutanix and open-source projects like OpenStack. Finally, the report warns that although AI architectures with 'agent' capabilities generate great expectations, they are still two years away from meeting expectations of complete automation. This type of AI faces technical barriers due to the need for advanced models and complex data architectures, and 75% of companies that attempt to build these systems independently will fail.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 01, 2024 07:25 PM\nSource:[thestandardcio.com](https://thestandardcio.com/2024/11/01/estas-son-las-claves-de-forrester-para-navegar-el-futuro-en-ti-y-seguridad/)\n\n**5 Generative AI Trends to Watch in 2025**\nExperts predict a surge in the use of AI agents in 2025, which are semi-autonomous generative AI that can interact with applications to carry out instructions. However, the success of projects leveraging generative AI remains uncertain. Cybersecurity professionals will continue to take advantage of AI in 2025, but generative AI may present information that is inaccurate, and security teams must adapt to both using and defending against it. Organizations struggle to determine whether generative AI adds value and to what use cases it can make the most difference. Many companies that are incorporating generative AI at a large scale are seeing success, but others are expected to rigorously test -- and sometimes discard -- the features that don't deliver results. The environmental cost of building the data centers needed to run generative AI is also a concern, and companies will tout dubious and genuine claims of energy savings and environmental friendliness around AI. 'The pendulum has swung from 'new AI innovation at any cost' to a resounding imperative to prove ROI in board rooms across the world,' said Uzi Dvir, global CIO at WalkMe. 'As AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini become deeply integrated into business operations, the risk of accidental data exposure skyrockets with new data privacy challenges,' said Jeremy Fuchs, cyber security evangelist at Check Point Software Technologies. 'AI's growing role in cyber crime is undeniable,' Fuchs added. 'By 2025, AI will not only enhance the scale of attacks but also their sophistication.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2024 07:16 PM\nSource:[TechRepublic](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/generative-ai-trends-2025/)\n\n**PREDICT 2025: The Future of AI in the US**\nThe US financial services industry has been using AI for decades, but the adoption of generative AI tools like ChatGPT has created a new dimension. Despite the lack of a standardized methodology for regulating AI, the industry is continuing to innovate. According to Finextra's Future of AI in the US 2025 report, generative AI is proving valuable for various use cases, but the industry is slow to adopt AI for customer-facing initiatives, focusing instead on back-office automation, data aggregation, and fraud prevention. As automation increases, it may lead to more explainable AI models and a more ethical use of the technology, potentially reducing headcount and allowing bank tellers to take on higher-skilled responsibilities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 12:14 AM\nSource:[Finextra Research](https://www.finextra.com/event-info/535/predict-2025-the-future-of-ai-in-the-us)\n\n**US AI Export Rules Could Change Tech Markets, Experts Say**\nThe White House has introduced new restrictions on the export of American artificial intelligence breakthroughs, aiming to protect national security and maintain U.S. leadership in AI development. According to industry analysts, this could force American tech giants like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Microsoft to obtain government approval before sharing developments with overseas partners or selling to foreign customers. Kristof Horompoly, vice president of AI risk management at ValidMind, said, 'AI is really becoming a national security question, and there are going to be two sides to that.' The new restrictions could reshape the global AI market, with firms potentially needing government approval for deals with foreign customers, and could affect billions in international AI revenues.

US Mulls New AI Export Controls**\nThe Biden administration is considering imposing export controls on AI models, citing security risks. However, leading AI firms, civil society groups, and researchers argue that this move is impractical and counterproductive, as it could undermine US leadership in AI innovation and create constitutional issues. The key question is how such controls could be enforced, particularly for open-source models. US officials emphasize that AI's security risks outweigh the costs, but critics argue that restricting the movement of software bits and bytes is difficult, especially given the success of China's AI industry in using open-source technology. The proposed reporting rules would give the US government data needed to determine which AI models to restrict, but the Administration may not need a stalled bipartisan bill in Congress to implement new controls. Microsoft and Google argue that restricting open models would damage global collaboration on talent, research, and safety, while Meta claims controls on AI would cause the US to cede an opportunity to embed US 'values in the fabric of the AI revolution' by setting global standards.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 03:25 PM\nSource:[cepa.org](https://cepa.org/article/curbing-code-us-mulls-new-ai-export-controls/)\n\n**US to impose AI investment restrictions in China**\nThe US government is finalizing rules to ban certain American investments in artificial intelligence (AI) in China, as part of an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023. The rules, which target outbound investments to China in AI, semiconductors, microelectronics, and quantum computing, are expected to be published within the next week. According to Laura Black, a lawyer at Akin Gump, the Treasury department typically allows a minimum of 30 days before new rules take effect, suggesting that the rules may be published before the upcoming US presidential election on 5 November 2024. The proposed rules require US individuals and companies to self-assess which transactions would be restricted, and provide exceptions for publicly traded securities, certain limited partnership investments, and specific syndicated debt financings.

The Biden administration has discussed capping shipments of advanced AI chips from Nvidia and other American companies on a country-specific basis, due to national security concerns. The potential policy aims to prevent AI chip exports from being diverted to China. The US Commerce Department has already introduced new export controls on high-tech items, including AI, and is facilitating a process to introduce additional controls. Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration Thea D. Rozman Kendler said, 'The most effective way to protect our national security is to develop and coordinate our controls alongside like-minded partners.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 03:12 AM\nSource:[tmtpost.com](https://www.tmtpost.com/7286803.html)\n\n**US Considers Stricter Controls on Chip Exports to Middle East**\nThe US is considering stricter controls on the export of chips produced by American companies like Nvidia and AMD to certain countries, particularly those in the Persian Gulf. This move is in response to the interest of these countries in developing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, which require powerful computational resources. The restrictions may affect countries that could use these technologies for military purposes, including China, which gains access to the technologies through third-party countries, according to Bloomberg. In 2023, the US Department of Commerce already imposed similar restrictions on most Middle Eastern countries, requiring American companies to obtain special licenses for exporting chips and equipment. The current discussions are at an early stage, but new restrictions could significantly impact AI development in the region. As one expert noted, 'The development of AI is a key area of competition between the US and China, and the US is taking steps to ensure that its technological edge is not compromised.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 01:46 AM\nSource:[Pravda](https://www.pravda.ru/news/economics/2110843-export-of-ai-chips/)\n\n**US to Tighten Export Framework for AI Chips to the Middle East**\nThe US wants to tighten the framework for exporting AI chips to the Middle East. According to sources, the cap on the number of export licenses will be set for countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE. This move may strengthen restrictions initially aimed at China in the field of AI. The control will be based on the updated program for checking end-users (VEU), announced by the US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in late September. The program will now include foreign data centers (DCs), which will have to meet export control requirements after a 'thorough interagency review' by the State Department, the Pentagon, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Energy. As BIS stated, 'This will allow US exporters to send certain products to pre-approved organizations under a general license, rather than individual export licenses.' This means that each specific DC will no longer be required to obtain an individual license for specific chips - they will be included in the VEU program after review. Reuters described the BIS initiative as a way to facilitate the export of Nvidia chips for DCs in the Middle East after the US authorities began requiring licenses for their supplies to this region, as well as to Africa and Central Asia, starting from November 2023. However, according to Bloomberg, the number of participants in such a program may be limited.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 09:42 PM\nSource:[Ведомости](https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2024/10/16/1068929-pochemu-ssha-hotyat-uzhestochit-ramki-eksporta-chipov-ii)\n\n**US Considers Limiting Export of AI Chips to Certain Countries**\nThe US administration is considering limiting the export of advanced AI chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. to certain countries. According to Bloomberg, the new approach would set a cap on export licenses for specific countries in the interest of national security. The focus is on countries in the Persian Gulf, where the demand for AI data centers is growing. The discussion is still in its early stages and remains unclear, said sources. The policy would be based on a new structure to simplify the process of licensing the supply of AI chips to data centers in places like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. As noted by the US government, American companies are not being accused of violating export controls, despite their components being supplied to Russia through intermediaries. Yesterday, EU High Representative Josep Borrell stated that Western countries, including EU member states, should increase control over the export activities of companies producing sensitive electronic components used by Russians in the production of weapons.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 03:15 AM\nSource:[rbc.ua](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/ssha-rozglyadayut-mozhlivist-obmezhennya-1728959877.html)\n\n**Will AI Change the Life of Programmers or Leave Them Without Work?**\nThe development of artificial intelligence (AI) and globalization is changing the IT and business landscape. According to a survey, 40% of developers are already using generative AI. The number of programmers from developing countries is growing, and India is expected to surpass the US in the number of developers in the near future. The Economist article suggests that AI will make developers more productive and programming software cheaper. The previous revolution in programming was the advent of the internet, which allowed developers to access information online instead of relying on manuals and guides. The spread of generative AI will lead to even more significant changes, as developers will be able to 'delegate' data search to AI. Another consequence of AI development is the emergence of numerous projects to create AI tools specifically for programming. According to PitchBook, a data collection company, around 250 startups are working on such projects. Large technology companies also have their own AI tools for developers. For example, Microsoft's Copilot chatbot can generate code in different languages, correct errors, and simplify it. Over two million users, including employees of 90% of Fortune 100 companies, have subscribed to it. In 2023, Alphabet and Meta also presented their chatbots, and in 2024, Amazon and Apple followed suit. There are also many companies that develop AI assistants only for internal use. Western companies are increasingly outsourcing coding to developers from other countries, allowing them to save on development costs. The authors of The Economist note that AI makes it easier to learn programming, which leads to an increase in the number of specialists in countries that previously lagged behind the West. According to Evans Data Corporation, the number of programmers in the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America is expected to increase by 21% and 17% respectively from 2023 to 2029, while in North America and Europe it will increase by 13% and 9%. Such changes will likely lead to large technology companies hiring foreign developers more often. According to Everest, about half of its IT expenses, including those related to programming, are already outsourced. Many companies that did not engage in IT outsourcing instead opened branches in countries where programmers earn less than in the US. The most popular location for outsourcing is India, which exported software and related services worth around $193 billion in 2023. About half of the IT products produced in other countries were bought by American companies. Sundeep Jain, a representative of the Indian IT company Wipro, told The Economist that his engineers participated in the development of Microsoft Teams corporate platform and chips and software for so-called connected cars. Another Indian company, Infosys, recently announced a five-year contract worth $2 billion. According to the head of the digital services department of the global oil services company Schlumberger, Shashi Menon, outsourcing allows companies to expand without excessive spending. In Menon's team, about half of the programmers are from Beijing and the Indian city of Pune. While AI is not yet developed enough to replace developers, it allows them to get rid of routine tasks. According to The Economist, the development of AI and mass outsourcing in programming are unlikely to leave Western developers without work. Despite all the achievements of recent years, AI's capabilities are still limited. Around 35% of developers who participated in the Evans Data survey replied that AI allows them to save 10-20% of their time. Respondents explained that AI models allow them to solve some basic tasks, but are not very useful in more complex aspects of programming and still make mistakes when writing code. An American software development company, GitClear, found in its research that the quality of code has decreased over the past year - possibly due to the use of artificial intelligence. Perhaps the situation will improve with the emergence of next-generation AI systems. In September, OpenAI released a new model o1, trained on new algorithms. According to its developers, it 'excels at generating and debugging complex code.' The authors of The Economist conclude that AI is unlikely to replace developers - and certainly not in the near future. It is much more likely that AI will continue to be used to solve the most 'boring' tasks, while more creative processes will be handled by developers themselves. Such a distribution of responsibilities will make software more accessible and cheaper.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 06, 2024 07:04 PM\nSource:[Rus.Postimees.ee](https://rus.postimees.ee/8109856/ii-izmenit-zhizn-programmistov-ili-ostavit-ih-bez-raboty-glavnoe-iz-teksta-the-economist-o-tom-kak-iskusstvennyy-intellekt-i-globalizaciya-vliyayut-na-it-i-biznes)\n\n**Chinese AI firms on track to narrow gap despite Nvidia controls | Insights | Bloomberg Professional Services**\nChina's AI companies are on track to narrow the performance gap with their US peers, despite earlier concerns about access to imported accelerator chips.

According to the new base, data centers will be able to apply for a certification called 'trusted end-user', which will allow them to receive chips under a general license, rather than requiring individual US suppliers to obtain licenses for each shipment, as reported by Reuters. A US official said that the US will work with data centers that apply for the program, as well as host governments, to ensure the safety and security of the technology. This move comes amid growing concerns in Washington that the Middle East may become a conduit for China to obtain advanced US chips that are prohibited from being shipped directly to China. The company 'G42', a Dubai-based AI company with long-standing ties to China, has been at the center of these concerns. In April, Microsoft announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in 'G42', and plans to provide the company with chips and model weights, advanced data that helps improve the AI model's ability to mimic human thought. The deal raised questions from lawmakers who take a hardline stance against China, despite 'G42' announcing in February 2024 that it would withdraw from China and accept US-imposed restrictions on working with US companies. 'G42' did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. The US Department of Commerce said in a statement that data centers that apply for the program will undergo a rigorous review process to ensure that the necessary safeguards are in place to prevent the transfer of US technology or its use in ways that contradict national security. 'We will work with data centers that apply for the program to ensure that they meet the necessary standards,' said a US official. 'We will also work with host governments to ensure that they are aware of and comply with US regulations.' \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 30, 2024 04:16 PM\nSource:[Alhurra](https://www.alhurra.com/tech/2024/09/30/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B7-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A)\n\n**US Intensifies 'Check on China' Over Cutting-Edge Technologies**\nThe United States is intensifying its 'check on China' over leadership in cutting-edge future technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), energy, semiconductors, and quantum. The US has placed technology and equipment used in the manufacturing of quantum computers and advanced AI semiconductors on export controls. Additionally, a measure was announced to ban the export of connected vehicles using Chinese software or hardware to the United States. The White House cited security risks, including the possibility of hacking attacks on connected vehicles. The US also plans to regulate Chinese connected vehicle technology, with vehicles installed with Chinese software or hardware unable to be sold in the US starting from the 2027 and 2028 model years, respectively. The US has shown its will to block the landing of Chinese electric vehicles at the source, with tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles quadrupled to 100% last May. The US is also securing core technologies that will determine future national capabilities, such as quantum, AI, advanced semiconductors, and space, and maintaining a super gap. This is why the US introduced export control policies on cutting-edge technologies such as quantum computers and AI semiconductor manufacturing in early September. The US is asking its allies to join the front line in the fight against China, with countries with similar export control policies exempted from the licensing process. This is a measure to prevent China and Russia from using these cutting-edge technologies to increase their military power and threaten the democratic camp through cooperation with friendly countries.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 28, 2024 03:50 AM\nSource:[newsdirectory3.com](https://www.newsdirectory3.com/ai-quantum-automobile-americas-check-on-china-and-the-worlds-tightrope-walking-%ed%95%9c%ec%84%b8%ed%9d%ac-%ed%85%8c%ed%81%ac%eb%9d%bc%ec%9d%b4%ed%94%84)\n\n**US Tightens Grip on China's Technological Advancements**\nThe United States is intensifying its check on China over leadership in cutting-edge future technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), energy, semiconductors, and quantum.

Two stocks to consider are Nvidia (NVDA) and ASML (ASML). Nvidia, a leader in AI technology, has pulled back 17% from its peak in June, but demand for its products continues to surge. CEO Jensen Huang said the company is under pressure to deliver for its customers, and big tech companies are willing to spend on generative AI technology. ASML, the leading lithography equipment manufacturer, has a strong economic moat in AI and is expected to see a cyclical rebound in demand for its machines in the second half of 2024 and into 2025. Despite concerns about export controls, the future of the chip fab industry looks brighter than ever, and ASML is likely to be a big beneficiary of the CHIPS Act. Nvidia stock trades down 17% from its peak, while ASML stock trades down 28% from its peak.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2024 09:55 AM\nSource:[Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-buy-hand-over-fist-amid-sell)\n\n**Competition, Not Control, is Key to Winning the Global AI Race**\nThe United States is facing a challenge from China in the global AI race, despite having much of the world's AI-enabling infrastructure. China is developing state-of-the-art AI systems and investing in its domestic technology base, making global AI competition synonymous with U.S.-China competition. The U.S. is enacting and considering new export controls to limit China's access to AI components, but these controls are difficult to implement and may have unintended consequences, such as a decline in U.S. competitiveness and uncertainty for the domestic tech industry. Instead, the U.S. should focus on competition and outcompeting its geopolitical rivals in AI development, implementation, and diffusion. This can be achieved by adopting a 'do no harm' approach to AI export controls, working with international partners to develop standards for AI adoption, and tailoring new AI systems to diverse international communities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 17, 2024 12:41 PM\nSource:[Just Security](https://www.justsecurity.org/100130/competition-not-control-is-key-to-winning-the-global-ai-race)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The investigation stems from reports that Netanyahu edited transcripts of high-level security meetings during the Gaza war to obscure or distort conversations regarding Israel's military response to Hamas. This comes as Israel faces significant legal challenges, including ICC consideration of arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over allegations of war crimes. South Africa has also filed a case at the ICJ accusing Israel of breaching the Genocide Convention during its military operations in Gaza. Netanyahu's office has dismissed allegations of altering meeting minutes as a 'web of lies' aimed at undermining his government, while his chief of staff, Tzachi Braverman, has denied allegations of blackmailing a military officer into altering records. Critics accuse Netanyahu of using his power to delay military action or prolong the Gaza conflict to distract from his legal troubles and prevent his governing coalition from collapsing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 10:01 PM\nSource:[NaturalNews.com](https://www.naturalnews.com/2024-11-14-netanyahu-investigation-altering-cabinet-meeting-minutes-scrutiny.html)\n\n**Seeing Through the Fog of Justice in Israel and Palestine**\nThe conflict in the Middle East is plagued by misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda. This article aims to dispel false claims about the International Criminal Court (ICC) and its investigation into the situation in Palestine. Contrary to claims by Israel, the United States, and others, the ICC has jurisdiction over both Israeli officials and Palestinian leaders. In 2015, Palestine became a member-state of the ICC, and in 2021, judges determined that the ICC Prosecutor has jurisdiction over Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. As a state recognized by 149 of 193 UN member states, Palestine has the right to have its citizens investigated by the ICC, regardless of where their atrocities are perpetrated. 'The Court also has jurisdiction over any atrocities committed on Palestinian territory, irrespective of the perpetrator's nationality,' according to the ICC's jurisdiction. Former Canadian Justice Minister Irwin Cotler's claim that the ICC has jurisdiction over Palestinian citizens but not Israeli ones is false. 'These claims are false,' the article states, emphasizing the ICC's jurisdiction over both Israeli officials and Palestinian leaders.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[qoshe.com](https://qoshe.com/e-international/mark-kersten/seeing-through-the-fog-of-justice-in-israel-and-palestine/178235146)\n\n**Israel questions ICC judge's impartiality in Netanyahu arrest case**\nIsrael has questioned the impartiality of International Criminal Court judge Beti Hohler, who is reviewing a request for arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others.

However, it relies on member states to enforce arrest warrants and does not have a police force of its own.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 04:35 PM\nSource:[alaraby.com](https://www.alaraby.com/news/%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88-%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%A3%D8%AB%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%B0%D9%84%D9%83-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B6%D9%8A%D8%A9)\n\n**World News | One of 3 Judges Weighing Request for ICC Arrest Warrants Against Netanyahu, Others Replaced | LatestLY**\nThe presiding judge of the International Criminal Court panel considering a request to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defence minister, and senior Hamas leaders has been replaced on medical grounds. Romanian judge Iulia Motoc was replaced by Slovenian judge Beti Hohler. The decision is likely to further delay a decision on the request by the court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, who accused Netanyahu and others of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip and Israel. Netanyahu called the accusations a 'disgrace', while US President Joe Biden called the request for warrants 'outrageous'. Hamas also denounced the ICC prosecutor's actions, saying the request to arrest its leaders 'equates the victim with the executioner'. Israel is not a member of the court, so even if the arrest warrants are issued, Netanyahu and his defence minister do not face any immediate risk of prosecution.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 03:53 PM\nSource:[LatestLY](https://www.latestly.com/agency-news/world-news-one-of-3-judges-weighing-request-for-icc-arrest-warrants-against-netanyahu-others-replaced-6370138.html)\n\n**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge Reviewing Netanyahu Arrest Warrant Request**\nThe International Criminal Court has replaced a Romanian judge who was reviewing a request to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu due to health reasons. This comes amid Israel's campaign against the International Criminal Court after it moved to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his Defense Minister. Earlier, reports in Hebrew media indicated an unusual statement from the International Criminal Court in The Hague, following reports that the prosecutor Karim Khan is being investigated for alleged sexual harassment of a colleague. Channel 12 reported that the International Criminal Court confirmed that a complaint has been received by the investigation committee against Prosecutor Karim Khan, accusing him of sexual harassment of a colleague. It is worth noting that Prosecutor Karim Khan requested the issuance of arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three leaders of Hamas for committing war crimes.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 03:44 PM\nSource:[بوابة فيتو](https://www.vetogate.com/5268151)\n\n**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge Preparing to Issue Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu**\nThe International Criminal Court announced today, Friday, that a judge who was preparing to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been replaced.

The court cited 'health reasons' for the decision. The ICC had previously requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu in May for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. The prosecutor, Karim Khan, stated that there were 'reasonable grounds' to believe that Netanyahu was responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. An arrest warrant was also requested for Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes. The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include 'causing genocide, causing famine as a means of warfare, including preventing humanitarian aid, and intentionally targeting civilians in the conflict'. The ICC has the authority to prosecute individuals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The court has issued arrest warrants in the past, including one for Russian President Vladimir Putin for alleged war crimes. However, the ICC only intervenes when national authorities are unable or unwilling to stop crimes.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 02:26 PM\nSource:[alarabiya.net](https://www.alarabiya.net/arab-and-world/2024/10/25/-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%84-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B6%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88)\n\n**ICC Delays on Netanyahu Arrest Warrant Raise Questions about Independence and Jurisdiction**\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has been deliberating on the arrest warrants requested by prosecutor Karim Khan for crimes committed in Israel and Gaza since October 7, 2023. The warrants target Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defense minister Yoav Gallant, and if evidence of his death is not found, Mohammed Deif, the head of the Hamas military branch. The three judges' delays have raised questions about their independence and the relevance of the ICC's jurisdiction. According to Professor Adil Haque, 'if in themselves arrest warrants do not stop crimes, they could have a real effect on the ground and potentially save many lives.' The ICC has allowed dozens of states, lawyers, and think tanks, including some from Christian evangelical lobbies and far-right Western groups, to submit a brief on the case. Israel has also intervened in the proceedings, submitting two briefs to the judges, one contesting the ICC's jurisdiction and the other requesting that the case be referred to Israeli courts. Israel claims it can try the alleged perpetrators of international law violations in Gaza on its own soil, hoping to avoid ICC prosecution. An observer of the ICC notes that 'if Israel participates, it's likely that they have obtained a guarantee' of a favorable outcome. Meanwhile, the ICC has not issued arrest warrants for Yahya Sinouar and Ismael Haniyeh, despite being requested by the prosecutor. Sinouar, the former head of Hamas, was killed by the Israeli army in Gaza on October 16. 'I would have liked to see Yahya Sinouar, Ismael Haniyeh, and Mohammed Deif appear before the ICC,' said UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese. US President Joe Biden welcomed Sinouar's death, stating that 'no terrorist, anywhere in the world, can escape justice.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 09:03 AM\nSource:[Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2024/10/24/le-silence-des-magistrats-de-la-cpi-saisis-du-dossier-netanyahou_6359156_3210.html)\n\n**Who is preventing ICC from arresting Netanyahu?**\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has not issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, despite Attorney General Karim Khan requesting it in May 2022. Khan stated that the evidence in the case was sufficient for the court to issue an arrest warrant, but four months later, no decision has been taken. Critics argue that the court is facing pressure from the US and other Western countries, which have threatened to impose sanctions or even invade the Netherlands, where the ICC is based. Former prosecutor Fatou Bensouda was subjected to similar pressure, and Khan has reported being under pressure not to investigate Israeli politicians. The ICC's Chief Prosecutor Khan has called on the court to hurry up and issue the arrest warrants, stating that there is no legal obstacle in the matter. The situation has led to mistrust in the international community, especially among Palestinians, and undermines confidence in law, courts, and justice.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2024 09:05 PM\nSource:[DAILY SABAH](https://www.dailysabah.com/opinion/op-ed/who-is-preventing-icc-from-arresting-netanyahu)\n\n**Netanyahu Expects International Arrest Warrants to be Issued Against Him Soon**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that he expects international arrest warrants to be issued against him soon. According to Channel 13, Netanyahu told the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee in the Knesset that he believes international arrest warrants will be issued against him and other officials in the near future. This comes after the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim Khan, requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in May for their alleged involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. Khan has made similar requests three times since May, and has urged the ICC to act quickly and without delay. Israel has not recognized the ICC's jurisdiction and has continued to defy its rulings, including a recent decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. Netanyahu has stated that Israel is going through 'fateful days' and has dismissed questions from the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee about the possibility of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's dismissal. 'It was a human error', a spokesperson for the Israeli Foreign Ministry said, explaining that the ministry had published a statement condemning the ICC's decision, only to later retract it. The ministry had published the statement on its website and on social media, but quickly removed it. Netanyahu's statement comes as Israel continues to defy international pressure to end its war in Gaza, which has been ongoing for 18 years and has left over 2 million Palestinians in dire conditions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 22, 2024 11:30 PM\nSource:[عربي21](https://arabi21.com/story/1627887/%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9-%D8%B5%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B6%D8%AF%D9%87-%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%A7)\n\n**Netanyahu Believes International Arrest Warrants Will Be Issued Against Him Soon**\nAccording to Israeli Channel 13, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believes that international arrest warrants will be issued against him and other officials soon by the International Criminal Court due to the war on Gaza.

This move comes in a tense context where the world is watching the developments in Gaza and the surrounding areas. Israel's government, through its foreign ministry spokesperson, Oran Margaliot, confirmed that it has submitted a formal appeal against the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the legitimacy of the prosecutor's requests. This appeal includes a legal challenge to the credibility of the actions taken by the court, with Israeli officials arguing that they do not have the right to consider this case. In July, the International Criminal Court gave more than 60 governments and legal organizations the opportunity to present their arguments regarding the proposed arrest warrants against Netanyahu and a group of other officials from both sides involved in the conflict. This move reflects a response to a call for action from within the international community in the face of the ongoing escalation of some conflicts in the region. The controversy surrounding the International Criminal Court has been ongoing, with many experts expressing doubts about its ability to enforce justice in complex international conflicts. Some experts believe that the court's actions may be sensitive to international policies. International reactions have been varied, with some countries viewing the request as a sign of interest in holding accountable those who may have committed crimes, while others see it as an unacceptable interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states. Reactions have been mixed, adding to the complexity of the legal and political context. In light of this escalation, Israeli officials have emphasized the importance of protecting their leaders from international legal threats, which could affect the country's political and economic situation. On the other hand, these developments highlight the need to address conflicts comprehensively, rather than through legal pursuits that may not address the underlying issue. In conclusion, Israel's moves to challenge the arrest warrants reflect a comprehensive legal and security strategy that shows the government's efforts to protect its leaders in the face of challenges that could affect the region's stability and security. Developments in this case will continue to be watched by the world, with more legal and political discussions expected about the role of the International Criminal Court.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 21, 2024 04:16 AM\nSource:[mangish.net](https://mangish.net/%d8%a5%d8%b3%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%a6%d9%8a%d9%84-%d8%aa%d8%b9%d9%84%d9%86-%d8%b7%d8%b9%d9%86%d8%a7%d9%8b-%d8%b1%d8%b3%d9%85%d9%8a%d9%8b%d8%a7-%d9%84%d9%84%d9%85%d8%ad%d9%83%d9%85%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%ac)\n\n**Israel Challenges ICC Request for Netanyahu Arrest Warrant**\nIsrael has officially submitted a challenge to the International Criminal Court's request to issue an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

In 2025, we will see neutrals getting warmer and earthier and deeply serene, nature-inspired colours continuing to grow in popularity.' Earthy tones are set to dominate, with rich jewel shades like purple and brown leading the way. Lick's colour palette for 2025 includes both dark jewel tones and earthy tones, as does Benjamin Moore's colour palette accompanying its COTY of 2025, Cinnamon Slate. Dulux's colour of the year for 2025, True Joy, is a vibrant, sunny yellow that can be used as an accent colour or as part of a wider colour scheme. 'Whilst yellow is one of the bolder colours on the spectrum, True Joy is complementary to a vast range of palettes, it brings out the positivity in even the most neutral of shades and is the figurative glue that binds more daring colour stories together,' says Marianne Shillingford, creative director and colour expert at Dulux. The cultural mood for 2025 is nostalgia, which has trickled down into interiors, impacting how we decorate our homes.

Blue eyeshadow, a throwback to the '70s and Y2K era, is a key trend, with frosted blue and electric blue shades making an appearance on the runways. Pastel tones, including bright pink and spring green, are also prominent, often paired with a grungy, smudged look. Bold lip colors, including lacquered cherry reds, are also trending, with designers like Chanel and Moschino showcasing the look. Additionally, the 'clean girl' aesthetic, characterized by a bare-faced look with minimal makeup, is still going strong. Hair trends include sleek, polished styles, such as slicked-back crops and buns, as well as retro silhouettes and sculpted shapes. 'In France, after red lipstick, our favourite lip look is called 'bouche mordue' (just bitten lips),' says Violette Serrat, founder of Violette Fr. 'To achieve it, we apply lip balm, a touch of lipstick, then kiss a tissue to remove excess shine so it looks more like our naked lips.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2024 07:09 AM\nSource:[Who What Wear UK](https://www.whowhatwear.com/beauty/makeup/spring-summer-2025-beauty-trends)\n\n**Pantone's Fall/Winter 2024-2025 Color Palette: Rich and Connected to Nature**\nAccording to Pantone, a global authority on color and trend forecasting, the colors for Fall/Winter 2024-2025 are rich and connected to nature. The colors are warm and natural, with a focus on earthy tones. To explore these colors further, we spoke with interior designer and architect Halima Meskum, who lives in Dubai. Here are seven Pantone colors for Fall/Winter 2024-2025, each with its own unique characteristics and suggestions for how to use them in your home. Starlight Blue is a light blue that evokes a sense of calmness and serenity, making it perfect for bedrooms and bathrooms. Wave Ride is a medium blue that adds energy and vitality to a space, and can be paired with neutral colors like white or gray. Iguana is a dark green that brings a sense of warmth and naturalness to a space, and can be used as a statement color in a room. Storm Front is a dark gray that adds a sense of power and sophistication to a space, and can be paired with dark blue or warm yellow. Misted Yellow is a warm yellow that adds a sense of optimism and joy to a space, and can be paired with neutral colors like gray or white. Pinecone is a dark brown that adds a sense of stability and warmth to a space, and can be used in living rooms and bedrooms. Cherry Tomato is a bright red that adds a sense of energy and vitality to a space, and can be used in kitchens and dining rooms.

According to Martha Franco, 'Grays can feel cold and impersonal, not conveying warmth and welcoming spaces.' Helen Shaw suggests replacing gray with 'Summerdale Gold HC-17', a warm and earthy color. Josephine du Rietz predicts that white will be replaced with bolder colors, such as burgundy. Peter Spalding suggests that green kitchens will be 'absolutely dead' and recommends aubergine as a replacement. The designers also advise against using blue, suggesting that rich jewel tones or lilac/violet tones can add depth and sophistication.

They can be paired with cream tones, but also with bolder tones. Violeta has shown that you can even combine white with a golden sequined skirt. According to the stars of the Street Style of the Copenhagen Fashion Week, the formula is reliable: wear white from head to toe. This is a classic choice that can be combined with the latest trends of the season. As Paula Echevarría said, 'Gorof is a great brand that combines elegance and irreverence.' She has chosen the Argentine designer's brand for her outfit, a white top with a palazzo pant, both in white. 'I am one of the first celebrities to wear Gorof in Spain,' she added.

Gone are the days of the grey and industrial aesthetic of the 2000s, and the neutral chromatic palette that came with it. According to decorator Juliana de Giacomi, 'Before, people seemed to be afraid of color, it was shunned. We stuck to a minimalist, Pinterest-inspired home, and it was almost sterile.' The new color trends for 2025 are bold and vibrant, but not so overwhelming that they cause eye strain. Think sophisticated dark red, warm brown, and buttery yellow. The beige and terracotta of the past are being replaced by the grey pigeon, burnt orange, and caramel brown. These new colors are perfect for creating a feel-good atmosphere, and can be incorporated into your space through accent walls, accessories, or furniture.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 07:05 AM\nSource:[bibamagazine.fr](https://www.bibamagazine.fr/deco-2/adieu-beige-terracotta-voici-couleurs-plus-tendances-deco-2025-438791.html)\n\n**New Year's 2025 Colors: What to Wear According to the Chinese Calendar**\nWhen choosing an outfit for New Year's 2025, consider the trends, overall style of celebration, and the symbol of the next year according to the Chinese calendar. 2025 is the year of the Wooden Green Snake.

This will be the fourth and final supermoon of the year. The next supermoon will not occur until October 2025. According to NASA, the full moon will be visible on Friday at 21h29 in Portugal, making it a favorable time for observation. However, the Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA) predicts a cloudy and rainy sky for the entire country, which may spoil the view. A supermoon is a popular term for a full moon that occurs at the point in its orbit closest to the Earth, known as perigee. The distance of this point varies from supermoon to supermoon, depending on the Earth's position in its orbit around the Sun. This time, the moon will be about 361,000 kilometers away from the planet, 4,500 kilometers farther than the supermoon of October 17, which was the closest to the Earth this year and therefore the brightest. The first supermoon of 2024 occurred in August and coincided with a 'blue moon', which was not actually blue, but the second full moon of the month. Super 'blue' moons are rare events, with the next one predicted to occur in January 2037.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 08:45 AM\nSource:[Publico](https://www.publico.pt/2024/11/14/ciencia/noticia/vem-ai-ultima-superlua-ano-vai-preciso-esperar-outubro-2025-2111742)\n\n**Nail Trends for the Year of the Snake 2025**\nThe upcoming year 2025 is the Year of the Snake in the Eastern calendar, which will bring its trends to the world of nail design. The snake symbolizes wisdom, intuition, and protection in Eastern culture, and is associated with mystery and femininity. These elements can inspire a variety of nail designs using different textures and colors. Black and green colors will dominate the design, with black representing strength and green representing life energy. Adding gold and silver accents will symbolize prosperity and success. A combination of these colors will create a sophisticated and refined nail design that will perfectly match the festive atmosphere. In 2025, minimalism will remain in fashion, with simplicity always being in style. A minimalist nail design is a great choice for those who prefer to wear elegant nail polish. One of the key features of minimalist nail design is the use of natural shades, such as beige, nude, or pastel tones. However, even in minimalism, you can add elements of the New Year's atmosphere. Thin gold or silver lines can add magic to the basic nail design, and small accents, such as small dots or rhinestones, can make it more festive. If you like to stand out, pay attention to combining bright colors. For example, blue and red or purple and yellow can create a memorable and fresh look. You can also try patterns, such as dots or stripes. These elements will look especially effective if they are combined with New Year's motifs, such as snowflakes or Christmas decorations. Such a nail design will definitely attract attention and help create a festive atmosphere. Textures in nail design are another interesting trend in 2025. Matte textures, metallic, and glossy finishes can be used in various combinations to create a unique and unusual design. For example, you can combine a matte black polish with a green glaze, creating an effective contrast. In addition, the use of various effects, such as 'cat's eye', will give the nail design a mysterious look. Such a nail design will be perfectly suited to the New Year. The color palette plays a key role in creating a successful nail design. In the upcoming year, the following colors will be in the spotlight: Black is a classic that suits any occasion. In combination with other colors, it will be especially effective. For example, a black glossy finish with gold accents will create a sophisticated evening look. Shades of green, from deep emerald to light mint, will be relevant in this season. Green color symbolizes life energy and harmony, which is perfectly suited to the holiday. Red color is a color of passion and energy. It is traditionally associated with New Year's, so don't miss the opportunity to add it to your nail design. Red nails with gold or rhinestones will bring a festive atmosphere and brightness. Gold and silver are colors of success and wealth. They can be used as accents in any nail design, adding shine and luxury. For fans of more calm tones, soft pastel shades will be a great option. They can be very stylish and refined, especially in combination with a glossy finish. To care for your nail design during the holiday period, follow a few simple rules. After preparing your nails and applying polish, it is extremely important not to forget about moisturizing. Use special oils or creams to prevent dryness and cracks. To avoid damaging your nails, try to avoid sudden movements, such as opening tin cans or working with tools that can damage the coating. Proper nutrition plays a significant role in the health of your nails. Make sure you get enough vitamins and minerals, such as biotin and zinc, which help to strengthen the nail plate. Regular nail corrections will help keep your nail design in perfect condition. Even if you made a nail design for New Year's, don't forget about its condition during the holidays.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 04:31 AM\nSource:[aif.ru](https://aif.ru/health/secrets/manikyur-na-novyy-god-2025-trendy-dizayna-nogtey-v-god-zmei)\n\n**Trends for the New Year 2025: Successful Shades for Meeting the Green Wooden Snake**\nThe upcoming year 2025, under the patronage of the Green Wooden Snake, is a time for people to choose a new year's outfit that will bring them good luck and harmony. The snake, as an ancient symbol of wisdom and elegance, combined with its wooden element, represents a desire for nature, sustainability, and vitality. Therefore, the choice of color and style of new year's clothing becomes particularly important, as it can be a guarantee of success in the new year. According to piterburger.ru, the key colors for 2025 are green, yellow, turquoise, and metallic shades. Each of these colors has its own significance, making them important for both fashion and interior design. Green, the main color, is associated with life and harmony, representing nature and renewal. It is ideal for creating a calm and stable atmosphere. Shades of green, from bright emerald to soft pastel, will help create a space filled with freshness and vitality. Yellow, symbolizing the sun and warmth, will be a bright accent in the 2025 palette, bringing joy and prosperity, especially on New Year's Eve. Combining yellow with green and gold shades will create an atmosphere of celebration and positive change, attracting good luck and happiness. Turquoise, representing calmness and creativity, will help create balance and harmony in personal life. It can reveal creative potential, which is especially important during a period when people strive for self-expression. A turquoise outfit or accent in the interior will create a sense of freshness and tranquility. Metallic shades, such as gold, bronze, and silver, will add a touch of luxury and elegance. These shiny details symbolize success and material well-being, making them ideal for festive accessories. They will help complete the look, adding sophistication and shine. However, it is essential to remember that in 2025, it is recommended to avoid dark blue and black colors, which may conflict with the energy of the Wooden Snake. These colors are associated with the water element and may block positive changes. A proper color palette will help create a mood that corresponds to expectations and aspirations for the new year. For women, this year offers unique opportunities for experimenting with festive fashion. Stylists recommend choosing shiny fabrics and accessories that will emphasize elegance and add magic. Evening dresses made of velvet or silk with varying lengths from medium to maxi will be a successful choice, and decorations made of rhinestones and crystals will add a special shine. Dresses with drapery or flared sleeves will create an unforgettable style. In addition, jumpsuits with wide pants and bright decorative elements are a fashionable and original option for those who want to look impressive, especially in rich burgundy and emerald colors. Women's suits in non-standard colors, decorated with rhinestones or embroidery, will be perfect for a New Year's Eve. Accentuating skirts and tops with rhinestones, asymmetrical cuts, or lace will add romance and sophistication to the look. For men, it is worth paying attention to the choice of color and style of clothing that will correspond to the symbolism of the year of the Snake. Classic silhouettes, combined with lucky colors, will be an excellent choice. Elegant suits in emerald, burgundy, or gray shades will emphasize status and style. Fabrics such as velvet or tweed will add respectability to the look. Quiet chinos or slacks in beige or brown will perfectly match bright shirts and cardigans. A velvet jacket in a smart casual style will look great with dark jeans. For an accent, you can use a green tie or a brooch on the lapel, which will also symbolize good luck.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 10, 2024 09:00 PM\nSource:[piterburger.ru](https://www.piterburger.ru/313458.html)\n\n**Fall and Winter 2024-2025 Fashion Colors: A Guide**\nThis fall and winter, the fashion world is embracing a palette of rich, elegant colors that evoke warmth and sophistication.

According to them, the following 8 color trends will be popular next year: 'Deep, bold shades that really stand out' will be used as accents in rooms to emphasize a brighter and lighter palette. These saturated tones bring depth, elevating the space with a sense of elegance and sophistication. Neutral honey-like shades will continue to play a balancing role in offsetting bold accents and adding warm notes to the room. A designer notes that 'soothing and warm neutral colors have replaced cool, harsh whites.' For example, a soft terracotta brown, reminiscent of sun-baked clay, underlines the rise of earthy and warm tones. A vibrant purple hue, reminiscent of eggplants, grapes, and jam, is expected to make a splash in 2025. This bright color brings a sense of warmth and energy to interior spaces. One expert calls purple basil the color of the year 2025. This bold and striking shade not only pays homage to the plant but also inspires people to make a bold color choice for their interior. Brown tones have become 'sweeter' compared to their outdated look in 1970s interiors, and designers predict that in 2025, shades inspired by desserts, from chocolate and coffee to caramel and macarons, will dominate. Blues of medium tones have been in the spotlight for a few years, but it's time for deeper and more enchanting shades to shine. A bright ultramarine hue is highlighted for its ability to provide an captivating yet soothing atmosphere. A sky blue cobalt tone shows a connection to nature in your home, whether the walls are painted in such a tone or you have a couch in such a shade. Earthy and saturated yellow colors, reminiscent of umbers and ochres, are expected to become more popular as people prefer tones that create comfort and relief. Saturated warm colors based on umbers and ochres create cozy, peaceful, and charming spaces, says an expert. The color of ochre in the interior of a room / Photo Nathan Schroder.

According to Martha Franco, 'Grays can feel cold and impersonal, not conveying warmth and welcoming spaces.' Helen Shaw suggests replacing gray with 'Summerdale Gold HC-17', a warm and earthy color. Josephine du Rietz predicts that white will be replaced with bolder colors, such as burgundy. Peter Spalding suggests that green kitchens will be 'absolutely dead' and recommends aubergine as a replacement. The designers also advise against using blue, suggesting that rich jewel tones or lilac/violet tones can add depth and sophistication. Finally, they recommend replacing beige with earthy tones, such as terracotta, which can add character and warmth to a space.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 01:51 PM\nSource:[livingetc.com](https://www.livingetc.com/ideas/outdated-paint-colors)\n\n**Pantone Announces Moonbeam Grey as Color of the Year for 2025**\nThe Pantone Color Institute has announced that the color of the year for 2025 will be Moonbeam Grey, a light grey color reminiscent of a moonbeam.

The colors are part of five palettes: resistência, regeneração, nostalgia, hibridismo, and otimismo. 'Just like in life, everything is interconnected, the tones of the five palettes migrate between each other.

The new colors are expected to add warmth and sophistication to homes, making them ideal for social areas like kitchens and living rooms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 16, 2024 07:17 AM\nSource:[pledgetimes.com](https://pledgetimes.com/goodbye-to-blue-and-beige-the-three-new-colors-that-will-reign-in-our-interior-designs/)\n\n**How to Welcome the New Year 2025: Colors and Outfits**\nAccording to the Eastern calendar, the Green Wooden Snake will be the patron of the upcoming 2025 year, symbolizing wisdom and prudence.

Mandy Rippon, product manager at Frenchic Paint, says 'There is currently an eclectic mix of colours of the year and paint palette predictions for emerging colour trends... In 2025, we will see neutrals getting warmer and earthier and deeply serene, nature-inspired colours continuing to grow in popularity.' Earthy tones are set to dominate, with rich jewel shades like purple and brown leading the way. Lick's colour palette for 2025 includes both dark jewel tones and earthy tones, as does Benjamin Moore's colour palette accompanying its COTY of 2025, Cinnamon Slate. Dulux's colour of the year for 2025, True Joy, is a vibrant, sunny yellow that can be used as an accent colour or as part of a wider colour scheme. 'Whilst yellow is one of the bolder colours on the spectrum, True Joy is complementary to a vast range of palettes, it brings out the positivity in even the most neutral of shades and is the figurative glue that binds more daring colour stories together,' says Marianne Shillingford, creative director and colour expert at Dulux. The cultural mood for 2025 is nostalgia, which has trickled down into interiors, impacting how we decorate our homes. Lick's colour palette of 2025 features eight different shades that decorators would be familiar with, that would encapsulate that feeling of nostalgia and inspire decorators to think about the colours of their childhood.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 08:00 AM\nSource:[idealhome.co.uk](https://www.idealhome.co.uk/all-rooms/all-rooms-decor/colour-palette-for-2025)\n\n**Nail Trends for the Year of the Snake 2025**\nThe upcoming year 2025 is the Year of the Snake in the Eastern calendar, which will bring its trends to the world of nail design. The snake symbolizes wisdom, intuition, and protection in Eastern culture, and is associated with mystery and femininity. These elements can inspire a variety of nail designs using different textures and colors. Black and green colors will dominate the design, with black representing strength and green representing life energy. Adding gold and silver accents will symbolize prosperity and success. A combination of these colors will create a sophisticated and refined nail design that will perfectly match the festive atmosphere. In 2025, minimalism will remain in fashion, with simplicity always being in style. A minimalist nail design is a great choice for those who prefer to wear elegant nail polish. One of the key features of minimalist nail design is the use of natural shades, such as beige, nude, or pastel tones. However, even in minimalism, you can add elements of the New Year's atmosphere. Thin gold or silver lines can add magic to the basic nail design, and small accents, such as small dots or rhinestones, can make it more festive. If you like to stand out, pay attention to combining bright colors. For example, blue and red or purple and yellow can create a memorable and fresh look. You can also try patterns, such as dots or stripes. These elements will look especially effective if they are combined with New Year's motifs, such as snowflakes or Christmas decorations. Such a nail design will definitely attract attention and help create a festive atmosphere. Textures in nail design are another interesting trend in 2025. Matte textures, metallic, and glossy finishes can be used in various combinations to create a unique and unusual design. For example, you can combine a matte black polish with a green glaze, creating an effective contrast. In addition, the use of various effects, such as 'cat's eye', will give the nail design a mysterious look. Such a nail design will be perfectly suited to the New Year. The color palette plays a key role in creating a successful nail design. In the upcoming year, the following colors will be in the spotlight: Black is a classic that suits any occasion. In combination with other colors, it will be especially effective. For example, a black glossy finish with gold accents will create a sophisticated evening look. Shades of green, from deep emerald to light mint, will be relevant in this season. Green color symbolizes life energy and harmony, which is perfectly suited to the holiday. Red color is a color of passion and energy. It is traditionally associated with New Year's, so don't miss the opportunity to add it to your nail design. Red nails with gold or rhinestones will bring a festive atmosphere and brightness. Gold and silver are colors of success and wealth. They can be used as accents in any nail design, adding shine and luxury. For fans of more calm tones, soft pastel shades will be a great option. They can be very stylish and refined, especially in combination with a glossy finish. To care for your nail design during the holiday period, follow a few simple rules. After preparing your nails and applying polish, it is extremely important not to forget about moisturizing. Use special oils or creams to prevent dryness and cracks. To avoid damaging your nails, try to avoid sudden movements, such as opening tin cans or working with tools that can damage the coating. Proper nutrition plays a significant role in the health of your nails. Make sure you get enough vitamins and minerals, such as biotin and zinc, which help to strengthen the nail plate. Regular nail corrections will help keep your nail design in perfect condition. Even if you made a nail design for New Year's, don't forget about its condition during the holidays.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 04:31 AM\nSource:[aif.ru](https://aif.ru/health/secrets/manikyur-na-novyy-god-2025-trendy-dizayna-nogtey-v-god-zmei)\n\n**Colors to Wear in 2025: Attracting Success, Happiness, and Good Fortune**\nAccording to the Chinese calendar, 2025 is the year of the Green Wooden Snake.

According to them, the following 8 color trends will be popular next year: 'Deep, bold shades that really stand out' will be used as accents in rooms to emphasize a brighter and lighter palette. These saturated tones bring depth, elevating the space with a sense of elegance and sophistication. Neutral honey-like shades will continue to play a balancing role in offsetting bold accents and adding warm notes to the room. A designer notes that 'soothing and warm neutral colors have replaced cool, harsh whites.' For example, a soft terracotta brown, reminiscent of sun-baked clay, underlines the rise of earthy and warm tones. A vibrant purple hue, reminiscent of eggplants, grapes, and jam, is expected to make a splash in 2025. This bright color brings a sense of warmth and energy to interior spaces. One expert calls purple basil the color of the year 2025. This bold and striking shade not only pays homage to the plant but also inspires people to make a bold color choice for their interior. Brown tones have become 'sweeter' compared to their outdated look in 1970s interiors, and designers predict that in 2025, shades inspired by desserts, from chocolate and coffee to caramel and macarons, will dominate. Blues of medium tones have been in the spotlight for a few years, but it's time for deeper and more enchanting shades to shine. A bright ultramarine hue is highlighted for its ability to provide an captivating yet soothing atmosphere. A sky blue cobalt tone shows a connection to nature in your home, whether the walls are painted in such a tone or you have a couch in such a shade. Earthy and saturated yellow colors, reminiscent of umbers and ochres, are expected to become more popular as people prefer tones that create comfort and relief. Saturated warm colors based on umbers and ochres create cozy, peaceful, and charming spaces, says an expert. The color of ochre in the interior of a room / Photo Nathan Schroder. The shade of ruby and nostalgic red colors will play an important role in 2025. One expert mentions a 'hot' ruby shade, reminiscent of the fiery tones of the 90s, as one that will be in trend next year. Candy colors will be the accents in 2025. These bright tones create an electric feeling in the room, while serving as a departure from the gray tones often used in interior design in recent years.' \nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 12:57 PM\nSource:[24tv.ua](https://24tv.ua/design24/trendovi-kolori-interyeri-2025-rik-shho-prognozuyut-eksperti_n2664104)\n\n**Nicole Neumann's Color Guide for Spring-Summer 2025: Yellow, Pink, and Gold**\nNicole Neumann, a panelist on El Trece, has revealed the must-have colors for spring-summer 2025.

It is a color inspired by the brightness of the sun, giving you a lively and warm look, especially when combined with gold. According to an expert, to make the most of this season's look, we present to you orange jewelry models for fall 2024 and how to style them with your outfits to make a statement wherever you go. The orange gemstone jewelry has become a popular choice among many women, after several famous jewelry brands have showcased stunning designs featuring orange gemstones, such as citrine and orange sapphire. One of the standout designs is the Fanfare Symphony necklace from Gerard Garrard, made of 18-karat yellow gold, featuring a round orange sapphire weighing 0.27 carats, 14 round diamonds weighing 0.11 carats, and 7 pieces of golden mother-of-pearl that harmonize with the yellow gold, adding a touch of magic and allure to the design. This necklace is perfect for a simple everyday look with calm-colored outfits, and can also be styled with evening outfits for a more dramatic look. The orange gemstone jewelry not only adds a touch of elegance but also carries a positive energy, making the wearer feel free and full of life, thanks to its bright color. The Bezel Mixed Drop necklace from Shay Shay is another stunning piece, featuring a modern design that grabs attention, especially with the droplet-shaped orange gemstones. Made of 18-karat white gold, it features a white diamond weighing 0.19 carats, a mix of citrine and yellow sapphire weighing around 4 carats, and various designs ranging from pears to hearts, and circular and rectangular shapes, as well as marquise cuts. This necklace will look great with a soft autumnal coat or a simple dress, and can also be layered with a short chain that complements it. The orange gemstone rings add an exceptional touch to your finger, especially when they feature a luxurious design that showcases the gemstone in the center, drawing attention to its vibrant color. The Fluted ring from Fabergé is a unique and exclusive design, part of the Colours of Love collection, made of 18-karat pink gold, featuring a round spessartite weighing 1.43 carats, 22 orange sapphires weighing 0.25 carats, a Mozambican sapphire weighing 0.02 carats, and 2 round diamonds weighing 0.02 carats.

To revamp your look with orange jewelry models for fall 2024, follow these tips: Look for simplicity: If you tend to wear calm colors in your outfits, such as black, white, or light brown, adding an orange jewelry piece, such as a ring or necklace, can be perfect to add a touch of life to your look without overdoing it. Use matching jewelry pieces: Choosing multiple jewelry pieces of the same color but in small or medium size can help achieve a balanced and attractive look. For example, pairing an orange ring with small earrings in the same color can draw attention to the details without overwhelming the look. Style the colors that complement the orange gemstone: Orange complements colors such as white, black, beige, earthy tones like brown, and gold, as well as warm colors like red or pink to create a lively and bright look.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 16, 2024 04:39 AM\nSource:[thenationpress.net](https://thenationpress.net/news-250584.html)\n\n**Goodbye Beige and Terracotta: The Top Color Trends for 2025**\nThis autumn-winter 2024-2025, the color is bold and unapologetic.

The tones vary from soft to intense, offering options that adapt to different styles and preferences. Bella launched the Sertões collection in October 2024, which features three new red hair tones inspired by nature and the strength of Brazilian landscapes: cacau, cor buriti, and ruivo cajá. 'The red hair brings a natural shine to the face and is perfect for those who want a sophisticated transformation without losing naturalness,' says Bella. The expert highlights that the red hair is ideal for those with fair skin, as its reflections enhance natural luminosity, but it also looks great on medium skin tones. 'This color is perfect for those who seek a more natural look, with a soft touch of red that blends with the brown tones,' explains Bella. She emphasizes that the cacau tone values fair and medium skin tones, giving a warm and harmonious effect. 'The buriti red is ideal for warm skin tones, such as dark and black skin, creating a stunning contrast. It illuminates the face and brings a fresh and natural vibe to the look,' highlights Bella. The cajá red is a more vibrant tone, approaching a golden orange. 'This red is perfect for those who want a bolder look, but still with a natural touch,' suggests the expert. It is versatile and can be adapted to different skin tones, especially for those with fair and medium skin and who seek a modern and personality-filled transformation. For those who want to be bold, the neon orange will be one of the most striking colors. 'This tone is ideal for extroverted people, who are not afraid to be the center of attention. It combines with all skin tones, but is especially vibrant on dark skin,' explains Bella. Another bet for 2025 are the warm, reddish tones, such as wine. 'These tones bring intensity and sophistication, creating a striking effect, especially on dark and black skin. It's a color that brings glamour and depth,' suggests the expert. Red hair for all hair types The tones of the Sertões collection and the other red hair trends for 2025 are extremely versatile. 'These colors were developed to value all skin tones,' says Bella, who adds: 'The secret is to adapt the tone to your personal style and find the nuance that best suits you. The Buriti Red, for example, is great for warm skin tones, while the Cacau is perfect for those who want a more natural look.' Hair care for red hair Bella reminds that red hair requires special care. 'As they are colors that fade quickly, it's essential to use specific shampoos and conditioners for colored hair and do weekly hydrations to maintain the health of the hair,' says. She also emphasizes the importance of using UV protection on the hair, especially in the summer, to prevent color fading. With a wide range of tones - from natural cacau to vibrant cajá red - 2025 will be the ideal year for those who want to express themselves through a red hair that is full of authenticity and style.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 05:00 PM\nSource:[Jovem Pan – Esportes, entretenimento, notícias e vídeos com credibilidade](https://jovempan.com.br/edicase/6-tons-de-ruivo-para-os-cabelos-em-2025.html)\n\n**AR Color Report: Menswear S/S ’25 Color Trend Report: Ember Glow**\nFor Spring/Summer 2025, Pantone has identified several key colour trends, including 'Ember Glow', a warm and nostalgic hue reminiscent of burnt orange and caramel.

To choose this tariff, consumers must have a 'smart meter' that can record hourly consumption. According to the Deputy Minister of Environment and Energy, Alexandra Sdoukou, the orange tariff will be available to business consumers with smart meters from the beginning of 2025. It is estimated that by the end of 2025, around 1.5 million supplies will have dynamic tariffs, accounting for about 60% of total energy consumption. Additionally, from 2025, the obligation for all suppliers to offer a 'green' tariff will be abolished. The green tariff was a mandatory offer that was based on a specific mathematical formula to allow for comparison between the green tariffs of all providers. However, it is expected that the green tariff will gradually decline as a product, as only certain categories of consumers will not be able to make a different choice. The market is now shifting towards 'blue' fixed tariffs, which are considered the most reliable option for simple household consumers. The increase in the wholesale market this summer, which affected both green and blue variable tariffs, has highlighted the stability of fixed tariffs as the safest choice for consumers.\nOriginal language: el\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 10:51 AM\nSource:[pagenews.gr](https://www.pagenews.gr/2024/10/15/spotlights/portokali-timologia-15-ekat-eksypnoi-metrites-eos-to-telos-tou-2025/)\n\n**Largest ‘Supermoon’ of the Year Coming this Week with Potentially Orange Hue**\nThe largest supermoon of 2024, known as the Hunter's Moon, will reach its peak illumination this week at 7:26 a.m. on Thursday, with the best viewing time being that evening.

This reptile symbolizes strength, wisdom, patience, harmony, and balance, as well as the ability to adapt to change. Green is a color associated with growth, development, good fortune, and prosperity. When choosing a dress for the New Year's Eve, it's recommended to opt for 'snake-like' shades such as green, olive, khaki, or emerald. These calm, deep colors complement each other well. Natural snake colors like sandy, brown, gray, milk, white, black, and dark colors are also suitable. New Year's dresses can be red, blue, or orange, and also include mysterious purple, rose shades, including delicate pink, explosive fuchsia, noble marsala, gold, and silver. The snake prefers strict styles and single-colored fabrics. Therefore, when choosing a dress or suit for the New Year, it's better to focus on classic models that emphasize the figure but don't draw too much attention. It's essential that the items are made from natural materials such as cotton, linen, or wool. Additionally, you can use decorative elements like sequins, embroidery, lace, or beads that imitate snake skin. Don't be stingy with accessories. They can be different: malachite, silver, gold, or with natural stones. It's better to avoid items with neon shades, strong contrast, and synthetic materials. Accessories made of natural snake skin, such as belts or handbags, should not be used on New Year's Eve, but a snake print is acceptable. Don't use cheap jewelry, artificial fabrics, and loud, flashy outfits: the Snake values elegance and good taste.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 06, 2024 05:10 AM\nSource:[Аргументы и факты](https://aif.ru/health/secrets/v-plate-kakogo-cveta-vstrechat-novyy-2025-god)\n\n**Tintas Suvinil chooses three colors for 2025: Despertar, Marrom Luxo, and Sossego Noturno**\nThe Tintas Suvinil, a Brazilian paint company, has chosen three colors for 2025: Despertar (a vibrant yellow that evokes hope and renewal), Marrom Luxo (a terracotta tone that connects with the essential and reflects new sophistication), and Sossego Noturno (a hybrid blue-violet tone that represents harmony between humans, technology, and nature).

Mandy Rippon, product manager at Frenchic Paint, says 'There is currently an eclectic mix of colours of the year and paint palette predictions for emerging colour trends... In 2025, we will see neutrals getting warmer and earthier and deeply serene, nature-inspired colours continuing to grow in popularity.' Earthy tones are set to dominate, with rich jewel shades like purple and brown leading the way. Lick's colour palette for 2025 includes both dark jewel tones and earthy tones, as does Benjamin Moore's colour palette accompanying its COTY of 2025, Cinnamon Slate. Dulux's colour of the year for 2025, True Joy, is a vibrant, sunny yellow that can be used as an accent colour or as part of a wider colour scheme. 'Whilst yellow is one of the bolder colours on the spectrum, True Joy is complementary to a vast range of palettes, it brings out the positivity in even the most neutral of shades and is the figurative glue that binds more daring colour stories together,' says Marianne Shillingford, creative director and colour expert at Dulux. The cultural mood for 2025 is nostalgia, which has trickled down into interiors, impacting how we decorate our homes. Lick's colour palette of 2025 features eight different shades that decorators would be familiar with, that would encapsulate that feeling of nostalgia and inspire decorators to think about the colours of their childhood.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 08:00 AM\nSource:[idealhome.co.uk](https://www.idealhome.co.uk/all-rooms/all-rooms-decor/colour-palette-for-2025)\n\n**Colors to Bring Success in 2025, According to Astrologers**\nAccording to astrologers, the colors that will bring success in 2025 are shades of brown and green, which are favored by the main symbol of the year, the Snake.

The tones vary from soft to intense, offering options that adapt to different styles and preferences. Bella launched the Sertões collection in October 2024, which features three new red hair tones inspired by nature and the strength of Brazilian landscapes: cacau, cor buriti, and ruivo cajá. 'The red hair brings a natural shine to the face and is perfect for those who want a sophisticated transformation without losing naturalness,' says Bella. The expert highlights that the red hair is ideal for those with fair skin, as its reflections enhance natural luminosity, but it also looks great on medium skin tones. 'This color is perfect for those who seek a more natural look, with a soft touch of red that blends with the brown tones,' explains Bella. She emphasizes that the cacau tone values fair and medium skin tones, giving a warm and harmonious effect. 'The buriti red is ideal for warm skin tones, such as dark and black skin, creating a stunning contrast. It illuminates the face and brings a fresh and natural vibe to the look,' highlights Bella. The cajá red is a more vibrant tone, approaching a golden orange. 'This red is perfect for those who want a bolder look, but still with a natural touch,' suggests the expert. It is versatile and can be adapted to different skin tones, especially for those with fair and medium skin and who seek a modern and personality-filled transformation. For those who want to be bold, the neon orange will be one of the most striking colors. 'This tone is ideal for extroverted people, who are not afraid to be the center of attention. It combines with all skin tones, but is especially vibrant on dark skin,' explains Bella. Another bet for 2025 are the warm, reddish tones, such as wine. 'These tones bring intensity and sophistication, creating a striking effect, especially on dark and black skin. It's a color that brings glamour and depth,' suggests the expert. Red hair for all hair types The tones of the Sertões collection and the other red hair trends for 2025 are extremely versatile. 'These colors were developed to value all skin tones,' says Bella, who adds: 'The secret is to adapt the tone to your personal style and find the nuance that best suits you. The Buriti Red, for example, is great for warm skin tones, while the Cacau is perfect for those who want a more natural look.' Hair care for red hair Bella reminds that red hair requires special care. 'As they are colors that fade quickly, it's essential to use specific shampoos and conditioners for colored hair and do weekly hydrations to maintain the health of the hair,' says. She also emphasizes the importance of using UV protection on the hair, especially in the summer, to prevent color fading. With a wide range of tones - from natural cacau to vibrant cajá red - 2025 will be the ideal year for those who want to express themselves through a red hair that is full of authenticity and style.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 05:00 PM\nSource:[Jovem Pan – Esportes, entretenimento, notícias e vídeos com credibilidade](https://jovempan.com.br/edicase/6-tons-de-ruivo-para-os-cabelos-em-2025.html)\n\n**AR Color Report: Menswear S/S ’25 Color Trend Report: Ember Glow**\nFor Spring/Summer 2025, Pantone has identified several key colour trends, including 'Ember Glow', a warm and nostalgic hue reminiscent of burnt orange and caramel.

Here's what colors designers say will be popular in 2025**\nInterior designers are moving away from the 'Unexpected Red Theory' and embracing new colors for 2025. Kathy Kuo suggests using wine red, or burgundy, as an accent color, while Bethany Adams recommends using yellow in unexpected ways, such as a statement sofa or a powder room. Kristina Khersonsky, founder of STUDIO KEETA, suggests using any color that feels surprising and out-of-place, such as cobalt or Yves Klein blue. The key is to ensure the rest of the room is decorated with warm tones and neutral colors to balance out the bold accent color. 'The unexpected red theory was the idea that adding a pop of red in a space can be that mysterious finishing touch,' Kathy explains. 'Now, we're extending from just 'red' to the darker end of the spectrum of red tones, like burgundy, maroon, and black cherry.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 06:00 PM\nSource:[homesandgardens.com](https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/whats-the-next-unexpected-red-theory)\n\n**8 Color Trends to Expect in 2025**\nExperts predict that in 2025, the interior design world will see a mix of unexpected and traditional colors. According to them, the following 8 color trends will be popular next year: 'Deep, bold shades that really stand out' will be used as accents in rooms to emphasize a brighter and lighter palette. These saturated tones bring depth, elevating the space with a sense of elegance and sophistication. Neutral honey-like shades will continue to play a balancing role in offsetting bold accents and adding warm notes to the room. A designer notes that 'soothing and warm neutral colors have replaced cool, harsh whites.' For example, a soft terracotta brown, reminiscent of sun-baked clay, underlines the rise of earthy and warm tones. A vibrant purple hue, reminiscent of eggplants, grapes, and jam, is expected to make a splash in 2025. This bright color brings a sense of warmth and energy to interior spaces. One expert calls purple basil the color of the year 2025. This bold and striking shade not only pays homage to the plant but also inspires people to make a bold color choice for their interior. Brown tones have become 'sweeter' compared to their outdated look in 1970s interiors, and designers predict that in 2025, shades inspired by desserts, from chocolate and coffee to caramel and macarons, will dominate. Blues of medium tones have been in the spotlight for a few years, but it's time for deeper and more enchanting shades to shine. A bright ultramarine hue is highlighted for its ability to provide an captivating yet soothing atmosphere. A sky blue cobalt tone shows a connection to nature in your home, whether the walls are painted in such a tone or you have a couch in such a shade. Earthy and saturated yellow colors, reminiscent of umbers and ochres, are expected to become more popular as people prefer tones that create comfort and relief. Saturated warm colors based on umbers and ochres create cozy, peaceful, and charming spaces, says an expert. The color of ochre in the interior of a room / Photo Nathan Schroder. The shade of ruby and nostalgic red colors will play an important role in 2025. One expert mentions a 'hot' ruby shade, reminiscent of the fiery tones of the 90s, as one that will be in trend next year. Candy colors will be the accents in 2025. These bright tones create an electric feeling in the room, while serving as a departure from the gray tones often used in interior design in recent years.' \nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 12:57 PM\nSource:[24tv.ua](https://24tv.ua/design24/trendovi-kolori-interyeri-2025-rik-shho-prognozuyut-eksperti_n2664104)\n\n**Nail Polish Trends for Autumn: From Saffron to Wine Red**\nThe Pantone color trends for autumn/winter 2024/2025 include earthy tones, rich reds, and cool blues and grays.

According to Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, 'Grey is practical, shows character and depth, but with a touch of fashion that elevates it from traditional to something more contemporary and stimulating.' The color is expected to be seen in both casual and formal wear, as well as in high-end fabrics. The choice of grey is seen as a reflection of the desire for alignment with the natural world and its harmonious, timeless tones. Designers such as Alberta Ferretti, Fendi, Boss, and Bottega Veneta have already showcased their interpretations of the color in their recent fashion shows.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 10:58 PM\nSource:[VEJA](https://veja.abril.com.br/comportamento/50-tons-de-cinza-segundo-empresa-um-unico-tom-sera-a-cor-do-ano-de-2025/)\n\n**4 Trendy Hair Shades for 2025: Natural Colors Take Center Stage**\nAccording to fashion experts, the most stylish hair color options for 2025 will be gold and chestnut shades with a coppery undertone. These natural-looking colors will suit all women, regardless of skin tone. 'A soft, golden shade is perfect for those with warm skin tones and a preference for natural looks,' says a stylist. 'For those with dark hair, this color will refresh their overall look, make their locks shine, and add volume.' Coppery undertones have been a trend for several years, as they accentuate eye color, highlight the skin, and make it look soft and delicate. Adding dark streaks to a coppery tone creates an elegant and luxurious look. A warm, natural shade is suitable for blonde and red-haired women, as it enhances their natural beauty and creates a playful, carefree look. Adding a touch of copper or brown to a warm tone creates a perfect outfit without radical changes. Combining gold or copper with dark chocolate creates a popular look for 2025. This color can be achieved using ombre, shatush, or balayage techniques. The new hair color will complement any style - romantic, business, or festive.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 04, 2024 03:04 PM\nSource:[ТСН.ua](https://tsn.ua/other/4-trendovi-vidtinki-volossya-na-2025-rik-na-piku-populyarnosti-zalishayetsya-prirodnist-2673423.html)\n\n**Tintas Suvinil chooses three colors for 2025: Despertar, Marrom Luxo, and Sossego Noturno**\nThe Tintas Suvinil, a Brazilian paint company, has chosen three colors for 2025: Despertar (a vibrant yellow that evokes hope and renewal), Marrom Luxo (a terracotta tone that connects with the essential and reflects new sophistication), and Sossego Noturno (a hybrid blue-violet tone that represents harmony between humans, technology, and nature). According to Bruna Galliano, the company's creative director and color consultant, 'In a complex and multifaceted time, a single color would not be able to summarize the sentiment of the time. Choosing more than one is a great analogy of how different ideas and opinions can coexist and create new possibilities that benefit everyone.' The company's research showed a sense of community, a new tomorrow, and a new today, which led to the selection of these three colors. The Coral paint company, on the other hand, has chosen Curry Dourado (a warm and lively yellow) as its color for 2025, which is meant to transform any space and help people step out of their comfort zone. The Pantone Color Institute has not yet announced its color for 2025, but the WGSN, a company that specializes in consumer trends, has chosen Future Dusk (a blue-purple tone).\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 08:09 PM\nSource:[Diário do Grande ABC](https://www.dgabc.com.br/Noticia/4165488/qual-sera-a-cor-de-2025-para-esta-marca-de-tinta-sao-tres-entenda-conceito-e-veja-apostas)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

Jake Sullivan, the White House National Security Adviser, stated that the summit will provide an opportunity for the three leaders to confirm their shared understanding of North Korea's participation and coordinate their response. Sullivan emphasized that North Korea's potential deployment of troops to Ukraine would be a 'significant development' and that the three leaders would 'take it very seriously.' He also mentioned that the summit will discuss the possibility of North Korea's seventh nuclear test and the potential for a major provocation during the US presidential transition period. Sullivan stated, 'We will be watching very closely from now until January 20, 2025, the start of the next Trump administration.' The trilateral summit aims to establish a institutional framework for cooperation between the US, South Korea, and Japan, ensuring that their cooperation continues regardless of the US presidential transition.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 10:00 PM\nSource:[joongang.co.kr](https://www.joongang.co.kr/article/25292264)\n\n**North Korean Troops Deployed to Ukraine to Support Russia's Military Efforts**\nNorth Korean troops are being deployed to Ukraine to support Russia's military efforts, according to the US and Ukrainian governments. The move has sparked concern among Western leaders, who fear it could destabilize the region and threaten global security. The North Korean troops are part of a 10,000-strong contingent sent by Pyongyang to support Russia's military operations in Ukraine. The deployment is seen as a strategic move by Russia to bolster its military capabilities and counter the influence of the US and its allies. The North Korean troops are expected to play a key role in the upcoming battles in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces have been pushing back against Russian advances. The deployment has also raised concerns about the potential for conflict between North Korea and Ukraine, as well as the risks of nuclear proliferation. 'This is a game-changer for the region,' said Mark Rutte, the new Secretary General of NATO. 'The deployment of North Korean troops to Ukraine is a clear indication of Russia's willingness to take risks and challenge the international order.' The move has also been seen as a strategic partnership between Russia and North Korea, with both countries seeking to counter the influence of the US and its allies. 'This is a new era of cooperation between Russia and North Korea,' said Vladimir Putin, the Russian President. 'We are committed to working together to achieve our common goals and to defend our shared interests.' The deployment of North Korean troops to Ukraine has also raised concerns about the potential for human rights abuses and the treatment of prisoners of war. 'The North Korean military has a reputation for brutality and human rights abuses,' said Chad O'Carroll, a specialist on North Korea. 'We need to be concerned about the potential for atrocities and the treatment of prisoners of war.' The deployment of North Korean troops to Ukraine is a complex and sensitive issue, with far-reaching implications for global security and stability. 'This is a major development that requires careful consideration and a coordinated response from the international community,' said Andreï Lankov, a specialist on North Korea. 'We need to be vigilant and proactive in addressing the potential risks and challenges associated with this deployment.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 04:59 PM\nSource:[Le Figaro.fr](https://www.lefigaro.fr/international/guerre-en-ukraine-des-soldats-nord-coreens-prets-a-intervenir-aux-cotes-des-russes-a-koursk-20241114)\n\n**North Korea's Deployment of Troops to Ukraine-Russia War Brings World Closer to Global Conflict**\nNorth Korea's deployment of troops to the war between Russia and Ukraine has brought the world one step closer to a global war, according to American expert John Hemming. He notes that North Korea has provided significant material support to Russia's military efforts, including 8 million rounds of ammunition and various ballistic missiles. 'Deploying soldiers to help 50,000 Russians defend Kursk against exhausted Ukrainian military units is a significant escalation,' Hemming says. He warns that the consequences of this action could go beyond the war between Russia and Ukraine, particularly in the context of the Indo-Pacific region, as North Korean units fighting alongside Russian forces may gain access to modern technology and warfare tactics. 'In 2019, I wrote that the world was moving towards a 'new Cold War.' Few can argue that we are not heading in that direction now. And as North Korea's closer ties with Russia show, the future competition will likely have a truly global character,' Hemming concludes. US State Department officials have confirmed that North Korean troops are already fighting in the Kursk region, with many of the over 10,000 North Korean soldiers deployed to Russia now participating in combat operations alongside Russian forces.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 02:20 PM\nSource:[УНІАН](https://www.unian.net/world/voyska-kndr-v-ukraine-severnaya-koreya-na-shag-priblizila-mir-k-globalnoy-voyne-12820218.html)\n\n**US Explains What Hinders Effectiveness of North Korean Soldiers in Russian Army**\nAccording to the US State Department's official website, spokesperson Vedant Patel explained that the effectiveness of North Korean soldiers in the Russian army on the front lines will be hindered by several factors. Patel stated that the potential success of 'the second army of the world' on the battlefield, which involves the use of North Korean units, will largely depend on how well the Russian command can integrate this 'live force' into their occupying forces. Patel identified key challenges for this integration as a language barrier, coordination and command, management, and communication. The US has already begun close consultations with allies and other European countries to minimize the consequences of a negative development in the situation.

The US has confirmed that thousands of North Korean troops have begun engaging in combat operations alongside Russian forces in the Kursk region. Blinken described this development as 'a profound and incredibly dangerous development.' The US is committed to providing aid to Ukraine before Donald Trump takes office, with President Joe Biden stating that every dollar will be pushed out the door between now and January 20. However, the future of assistance for Ukraine is uncertain, with Trump's election victory and a political crisis in Germany heightening fears.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 09:07 PM\nSource:[wionews.com](https://www.wionews.com/world/us-vows-firm-response-to-north-korea-for-deploying-troops-in-ukraine-775965)\n\n**South Korea to Send Military Personnel to Ukraine Amid North Korean Deployment**\nSouth Korea plans to send an unspecified number of military personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops reportedly deployed in the Kursk region of Russia and Ukraine, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Experts at ISW also believe that Putin is not interested in a ceasefire through negotiations and continues to aim to destroy Ukrainian statehood. This is supported by statements from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who told Serbian President Alexander Vucic that Russia will achieve its goals in the 'special military operation' in Ukraine. Additionally, Putin stated during a press conference with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban that a ceasefire would allow Ukraine to regroup and rearm, which ISW and other non-Kremlin experts disagree with, saying that a ceasefire would only benefit Russia and give it time to further radicalize and militarize Russian society against Ukraine, and allow Russian troops to rest and recover before a potential future attack on Ukraine. 'A ceasefire through negotiations at the current lines and under the current circumstances would only benefit Russia and give the Kremlin time for further radicalization and militarization of Russian society against Ukraine, and Russian troops time to rest and recover, likely before a future attack on Ukraine,' said the ISW.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: November 01, 2024 10:17 AM\nSource:[real-vin.com](https://real-vin.com/pivdenna-koreja-hoche-napraviti-v-ukrainu-svoih-vijskovih-isw)\n\n**North Korea Joins Russia's War Against Ukraine: Operational and Strategic Implications in Ukraine and Northeast Asia**\nNorth Korea has deployed a contingent of troops to Russia in support of Russia's war in Ukraine. The deployment is part of a growing relationship between the two countries, which has been intensifying since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Kremlin is likely to leverage North Korean manpower to support its ongoing offensive efforts and offset requirements of Russia's domestic force generation capacity. North Korea's military has not experienced large-scale conventional combat since 1953 and understands that its doctrine is unprepared to fight in a modern war, especially against a sophisticated adversary such as South Korea. Pyongyang likely hopes that its forces will have the opportunity to refine offensive doctrine, test their weapons systems against a Western-provisioned adversary, gain command and control experience, and learn how to operate drones and electronic warfare (EW) systems on the modern battlefield. The actual ability of North Korean forces to absorb, disseminate, and institutionalize lessons learned on the battlefield is entirely contingent on how the Russian command uses North Korean manpower. If Russia uses North Korean personnel as 'cannon fodder,' the casualties that North Korean troops are sure to accrue will undermine whatever battlefield lessons Pyongyang hopes to learn. The deployment of North Korean troops to Russia emphasizes Putin's continued reliance on pursuing alternative force generation avenues to support the war effort instead of committing to a wider societal mobilization. Putin has continually taken efforts to support the Russian war effort without fully shifting Russian society to a wartime footing, apparently assessing that the domestic costs of ordering another involuntary reserve callup outweigh the benefits and opting instead to heavily rely on crypto and shadow mobilization. The manpower that can be generated by crypto-mobilization is finite, however, and certain recent developments on the battlefield have introduced increased friction into the delicate recruitment system that the Kremlin has constructed. Ukraine's August 2024 incursion into Kursk Oblast made this issue particularly acute, as the Russian military has suddenly had to reckon with committing manpower and materiel to an entirely new part of the theater. Putin's response to the incursion has been to leverage conscripts and border guards, create new territorial defense units, and redeploy active units away from non-critical frontline positions in Ukraine, consistent with how he has handled managing force generation requirements throughout the war thus far. The use of North Korean troops is therefore an extension of the Kremlin's force generation approach — it allows Russia to build out its fighting force with up to 12,000 fresh personnel (for now) without needing to conduct a socially-costly domestic mobilization and deal with the resulting fall-out. The Russian command will send North Korean personnel first and foremost to Kursk Oblast, as confirmed by Ukrainian intelligence on October 24. The Kremlin likely views repelling Ukrainian forces from their salient in Kursk Oblast without disrupting other high-priority offensive efforts in Ukraine as an operational-level priority in the immediate term and coming months. Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief General Oleksandr Syrskyi stated that Russia deployed nearly 50,000 personnel from other areas of the theater to Kursk Oblast between August and early October, meaning that Russia has had to weaken other areas of the front in order to re-allocate troops to Kursk. Deploying some portion of the North Korean personnel to Kursk could allow the Russian command to re-allocate Russian personnel back to Ukraine, both to support ongoing offensive operations in Ukraine's east, and to sustain defensive efforts in the north and south. It could alternatively let the Kremlin avoid drawing additional high-quality Russian troops from ongoing offensive efforts in Ukraine. North Korean personnel are unlikely to deploy directly into Ukraine until the Kremlin deems that it has properly responded to the Kursk incursion, both because of the current priority the Kremlin is assigning to regaining its territory and because keeping North Korean troops on Russian soil gives Moscow greater control over the informational effects of using them. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[understandingwar.org](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/north-korea-joins-russias-war-against-ukraine-operational-and-strategic-implications)\n\n**North Korea Deploys Troops to Russia for Ukraine War**\nNorth Korea has sent a deputy chief of staff, Kim Yong Bok, to Russia, along with soldiers, to participate in the war in Ukraine. The soldiers are all under 20 years old and have undergone basic training in the 'Storm Corps'. The head of the North Korean foreign ministry, Choe Son Hui, has arrived in Moscow to negotiate with the Kremlin for additional troops to be sent to Russia. According to the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS), Kim Yong Bok is approaching the front line, but it is unclear how many soldiers from the 'Storm Corps' are accompanying him. The NIS has described this move as 'inevitable' and highlighted the top official's enthusiasm for participating in the war. Kim Yong Bok has compared himself to the KN-23 ballistic missile, which must appear on the front line first. 'I will go there first,' he said, according to the NIS. The NIS has warned that the soldiers, who are all under 20 years old, have undergone basic training and should not be underestimated. 'They have already undergone basic combat training, which they must undergo as 'Storm Corps', so we should never underestimate their combat ability,' the NIS analysts said. The NIS has also noted that the North Korean military personnel are studying Russian military terminology, including the 100 main commands. However, the NIS has expressed concerns about the language barrier. 'We are checking the possibility of deploying North Korean personnel, including high-ranking military officers, to the front line,' the NIS said. Meanwhile, Russian security forces have arrived in Pyongyang, according to the NIS. They arrived in the North Korean capital on special flights from Moscow on October 23-24. The purpose of the visit is to participate in the 'deployment of North Korean troops.' According to the NIS, the deployment will last until December 2024 and is expected to involve around 10,900 soldiers.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 07:05 PM\nSource:[ФОКУС](https://focus.ua/voennye-novosti/675925-voyska-kndr-v-rf-vmeste-s-generalami-gotovyatsya-k-boyam-v-ukraine-detali)\n\n**North Korean Troops Imminent Deployment in Ukraine: Zelensky Announces Escalation**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that his military has received information about the imminent deployment of North Korean soldiers alongside Russian forces on the Ukrainian front. According to Zelensky, the first contingents of North Korean soldiers could enter into action as early as this Sunday or Monday. The announcement intensifies concerns about the evolution of the conflict and represents a significant escalation of external involvement in support of Russia. 'This escalation is a clear response to Moscow's denials, which are trying to keep secret their growing dependence on external allies,' Zelensky said. The North Korean intervention represents an expansion of the conflict and raises alarms around the world. Zelensky urged international leaders to respond firmly and to put pressure on both Moscow and Pyongyang, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, to prevent this crisis from escalating further. 'The actual involvement of North Korea in combat cannot be met with indifference, but with concrete actions aimed at safeguarding global stability,' he declared. The Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR) corroborated Zelensky's statements, indicating that they have intercepted military communications from Russia that confirm the coordination between Moscow and North Korean troops. The intercepts suggest that Russia plans to assign translators and logistical support to North Korean units, hypothesizing that each group of 30 North Korean soldiers will be assisted by three Russian military personnel to facilitate operations. The presence of over 12,000 North Korean soldiers, including 500 officers and three generals, highlights the scope of Pyongyang's commitment to the war. The United States has condemned the deployment of North Korean troops, warning that every North Korean soldier deployed in Ukraine will be considered a legitimate military target. 'If they fight against Ukraine, they will become targets. The Ukrainian army will defend itself against them just as it is doing against Russian soldiers,' said John Kirby, spokesperson for the US National Security Council. The NATO has also expressed strong concern, defining the possible intervention of North Korea as a 'grave escalation' of the conflict. The alliance has warned that such a move could have serious international consequences, with the risk of expanding the war's scope beyond European borders.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 27, 2024 02:04 PM\nSource:[agenparl.eu/](https://agenparl.eu/2024/10/27/soldati-nordcoreani-pronti-a-combattere-contro-lucraina-zelensky-annuncia-unimminente-escalation/)\n\n**North Korean Troops Deployment to Ukraine: A Dangerous Escalation**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenski has warned that North Korean soldiers will be deployed to the front lines in the next few hours. According to Ukrainian intelligence, 3,000 North Korean soldiers, trained in Russian camps, will be sent to fight in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces control part of the Russian territory. Zelenski described this as an 'obvious escalation' by Russia, and called for a 'clear reaction' from the international community: 'The world needs to see clearly what Russia really wants, which is the continuation of the war.' Miguel Ángel Benedicto, a professor of International Relations at the Complutense University of Madrid, believes that this move by Russia is 'a dangerous step, because it strengthens one of the two power axes, and having two sides is what usually happens before a global conflict.' Antonio Herrera, a retired military officer and professor of the Master's degree in Peace, Defense, and International Security at the European University, agrees that 'the most important thing about this new move is the risk of a global war. It's clear that we're moving to an escalation of tension that could lead to a wider war.' Herrera notes that Vladimir Putin visited Pyongyang in June to sign a bilateral security agreement (Strategic Integral Association Treaty) with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Although North Korea had already begun supporting Russia with arms and ammunition, the deployment of soldiers is the next step, linked to an agreement that requires both powers to provide mutual assistance in case one of them is attacked, a scenario that opened up after Ukraine's incursions into Russian regions of Belgorod and Kursk. According to South Korean intelligence, Pyongyang has committed to sending up to 12,000 soldiers to the war in Ukraine, with Russia paying around $2,000 per soldier, in addition to agreeing to help perfect and strengthen North Korea's missile program. Herrera believes that the 3,000 men arrive at a good time for Russia, 'where the population is already starting to wonder where the country is headed in relation to Ukraine. It's already three years of conflict, and although there's a lot of disinformation, Russia has lost between 130,000 and 200,000 men. So, it needs personnel, as well as arms,' explains this military officer who participated in a five-year intelligence mission in Eastern European countries, including Ukraine. 'Even 12,000 men can be a small, symbolic thing, but it's an important thing.' In the short term, it solves the current internal problem for Russia, he says, but it may be just the tip of the iceberg, and that in 2025 this collaboration could increase. 'We're talking about a country with an army of 1.3 million soldiers and 7 million more in reserve. Its mandatory military service is 8 to 10 years. It's a completely militarized country.' Miguel Ángel Benedicto adds that he doesn't think '3,000 or 12,000 soldiers' will change the course of the war in Ukraine, but says that the step taken by Russia of adding Korea to the conflict 'adds fuel to the fire, and this time a trunk is very powerful. Korea has one of the most powerful armies,' he acknowledges. However, for Benedicto, the most relevant thing is that with this strategic move by Russia and Korea, the two axes of alliances are beginning to take shape, two sides, 'and that's what usually happens before a global conflict.' The professor believes that now the axis that forms 'Russia, Iran, North Korea, and a little behind all of them, China' is strengthened, which would be facing 'the EU, the US, that is, the West' that supports Ukraine. In his opinion, that these two axes are already positioning themselves in a live conflict 'is dangerous because you never know where the spark can come from, what can trigger a global conflict.' The same intention is intuited by Herrera to Russia. He says that 'it's sending signals that it's going to try to reach agreements with other countries to fight against the West. That fundamental idea of this mission,' he adds. The experts consulted by 20minutos do not consider it far-fetched that the conflict could be transferred from Eastern Europe to Asia. They explain that the fact that North Korea is militarily supporting Russia could mean that South Korea is seriously considering exporting arms to Ukraine. The Asian country has already suggested this and President Zelenski would be in need of it, with his European and American partners in a moment of lack of unity regarding increasing their military aid. Herrera believes that Kim Jong Un's participation in Ukraine allows him to test his military capabilities in a real way. 'North Korea is a state ready for action, but it hasn't carried out a military activity for years, this allows it to enter into operations and test its long-range missiles.' Something that has put South Korea on immediate alert, which has accused its northern neighbor of preparing for a possible transfrontier conflict. Benedicto says that it's still unclear what China thinks about all this and believes that the next natural step will be to see how the US, in the face of the Russian-Korean alliance, tightens ties with South Korea and Japan 'as a measure of containment of a possible global conflict.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 27, 2024 07:08 AM\nSource:[20 minutos](https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/5647815/0/analisis-despliegue-ruso-miles-soldados-coreanos-ucrania-incrementa-riesgo-una-guerra-global/)\n\n**Zelensky: Russia Prepares to Deploy North Korean Troops in Ukraine**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday that Russia is preparing to deploy North Korean troops to the battlefield in Ukraine before the middle of next week. According to a senior official in the Ukrainian presidential office, Zelensky has canceled a planned visit by UN Secretary-General António Guterres to Kiev. Western officials have warned that such a development would escalate the ongoing war since February 2022, and would have far-reaching geopolitical consequences that could extend to the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Zelensky stated through the Telegram app that the deployment of North Korean troops would be 'a clear escalatory step by Russia.' He did not provide further details, such as the regions where the North Korean soldiers might be sent. The deployment of North Korean troops under a military agreement between Moscow and Pyongyang would introduce a new dimension to the conflict, which is the largest war Europe has seen since World War II, and has already claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people on both sides, including many civilians.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 06:09 PM\nSource:[shorouknews.com](https://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=25102024&id=dd7536be-8c36-4689-b042-f126a1dd153a)\n\n**North Korean Troops Deployed to Russia to Aid in War Against Ukraine**\nNorth Korean troops have been sent to Russia to aid in the war against Ukraine, according to Ukrainian intelligence. The troops, who have undergone military training in eastern Russia, have been deployed to the Kursk region. The move has been confirmed by the US, NATO, and South Korean intelligence. The North Korean soldiers will be equipped with Russian gear and will be paid around $2,000 per month, although it is unclear how much of this money will actually reach the soldiers. The deployment of North Korean troops is seen as a sign of Russia's desperation in the war, with the US and other countries warning that it will only lead to further losses for Russia. The South Korean government has expressed concern over the deployment, with President Yoon Suk-yeol stating that it is a 'provocation that threatens global security' and that South Korea will take necessary measures to ensure its own security. South Korea is considering sending its own military personnel to Ukraine in response to the deployment of North Korean troops. The move is seen as a significant escalation of the conflict, with the North Korean troops potentially being used as 'cannon fodder' on the battlefield. The US has warned that the deployment of North Korean troops will only lead to further losses for Russia, with the US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, stating that 'if these troops are sent to fight in Ukraine, it will be a significant support to North Korea's illegal war against Ukraine and another sign of significant losses for Russia on the battlefield'. The deployment of North Korean troops is also seen as a sign of the desperation of the North Korean regime, which is seeking to gain access to advanced military technology and to gain experience in real combat. The South Korean government has expressed concern over the potential consequences of the deployment, with the country's defense minister, Lee Jong-sup, stating that 'if North Korea sends special forces to fight in Ukraine as part of the Russia-North Korea cooperation, we will support Ukraine step by step and also consider taking necessary measures to ensure the security of the Korean Peninsula'. The deployment of North Korean troops is a significant development in the conflict, and it remains to be seen how it will play out in the coming weeks and months.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 05:35 PM\nSource:[uatv.ua](https://uatv.ua/vojska-kndr-na-vojne-rossii-protiv-ukrainy-analiz-klyuchevyh-sobytij-nedeli-s-egorom-skorinoj/)\n\n**Zelensky Expects North Korean Soldiers to be Deployed Against Ukraine as Early as Sunday**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expects North Korean soldiers to be deployed against Ukraine as early as Sunday, according to reports from Western intelligence agencies. 'Our intelligence services indicate that Russia will deploy the first North Korean military personnel on October 27 and 28 in combat zones,' Zelensky said in online services on Friday. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed concern and warned that such support from North Korea for Russia would escalate the situation further. Zelensky urged the international community to put 'tangible pressure' on Pyongyang. The Ukrainian military intelligence agency reported on Thursday that the first units of the North Korean army had arrived in the Russian border region of Kursk, where Ukraine launched a counteroffensive in August. The US and NATO confirmed on Wednesday that North Korean soldiers were stationed in Russia. South Korea's intelligence agency previously reported that a total of 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been relocated to eastern Russia, where they would participate in training before being sent to the front in Ukraine. According to estimates from Seoul, Pyongyang could send up to 12,000 soldiers. Scholz called the development 'very alarming' during a visit to India on Friday, saying 'This is bad and, of course, it escalates the situation.' He added that it shows that Russian President Vladimir Putin is 'in great need' and that this is another reason to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia and to seek 'a just and fair peace for Ukraine' together with Kyiv.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 01:21 PM\nSource:[stern.de](https://www.stern.de/news/selenskyj--kampfeinsaetze-nordkoreanischer-soldaten-gegen-die-ukraine-ab-sonntag-35172416.html)\n\n**North Korean troops to be deployed in Ukraine by Russia in days -...**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has claimed that North Korean troops are poised to be deployed by Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine as early as this weekend.

According to Yonhap, a South Korean government source said, 'There is a possibility that personnel will be sent to Ukraine to observe the tactics and combat capabilities of North Korean special forces deployed alongside Russia.' Despite North Korea's denials, the Washington Post reports that thousands of North Korean soldiers are currently training in Russia and could be deployed in Ukraine by the end of the year. Additionally, an unspecified number of Kim's officials are already present in occupied Ukrainian territories to observe and study the battlefield. South Korea has recently summoned the Russian ambassador, Georgiy Zinoviev, to demand the immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops, which intelligence suggests have already arrived in Russia for training and deployment. Zinoviev has promised to report the concerns, but emphasized that cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang is carried out 'in accordance with international law.' South Korea is now evaluating all available options, including strengthening cooperation with NATO, as emerged from a recent meeting between President Yoon Suk Yeol and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. The possibility of South Korea sending personnel directly to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops would further strain relations with Moscow. The US and its allies have expressed strong concerns about the potential escalation of the conflict, calling the move 'dangerous and deeply troubling.' The US is consulting with its partners to assess the implications of this potential 'turn' in the war. South Korea and the UK have warned that Moscow will pay a high price for this military alliance with Pyongyang. South Korea's intelligence agency has revealed that North Korea has already sent 1,500 special forces to the Russian Far East, where they are completing a period of training and acclimation in local military bases, in preparation for potential deployment in combat.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 08:46 AM\nSource:[ilgiornale.it](https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica-estera/corea-sud-valuta-linvio-truppe-ucraina-lannuncio-seul-2384802.html)\n\n**South Korea May Send Military Personnel to Ukraine Amid Suspected North Korean Deployments – Yonhap**\nSouth Korea is considering deploying military intelligence personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops allegedly fighting for Russia.

The personnel would be recruited from South Korea's military intelligence units to analyze North Korean battlefield tactics and interrogate captured troops. Seoul is also considering providing defensive and lethal weapons to Ukraine, and has condemned North Korea's alleged troop deployment, warning of 'phased countermeasures' with the international community. The US has expressed concern about North Korea's plans, with Ambassador Robert Wood calling it a 'dangerous and highly concerning' step in Russian-North Korean military ties.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 08:29 AM\nSource:[themoscowtimes.com](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/10/22/south-korea-may-send-military-personnel-to-ukraine-amid-suspected-north-korean-deployments-yonhap-a86767)\n\n**North Korea Deploys Troops to Russia for Ukraine Conflict**\nSouth Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) has released satellite images showing the arrival and training of thousands of North Korean soldiers in Russia, in an operation that could escalate the internationalization of the conflict in Ukraine. According to the NIS, Russia began transporting North Korean troops by ship on October 8, with four Russian naval vessels carrying around 1,500 special forces soldiers from the North Korean ports of Chongjin, Hamhung, and Musudan to Vladivostok. The NIS estimates that Pyongyang plans to send at least 12,000 combatants. A video released by Ukrainian authorities appears to show North Korean soldiers receiving packages at a Russian training center. While Russia has denied the arrival of foreign troops on its soil, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had previously stated that his intelligence services had detected the deployment of North Korean personnel and officers in Ukraine. The US has not confirmed these movements, but if true, it would mark a dangerous escalation in Russia's war against Ukraine, according to Sean Savett, a spokesperson for the US National Security Council. Since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, no other country has officially deployed its troops alongside Russia's. North Korea had previously supplied Russia with munitions, rockets, and missiles. The two nations signed a new strategic partnership treaty in June, which includes mutual defense obligations in case of an attack on either country. 'Since the war has moved onto Russian territory, Moscow can invoke this clause of the treaty,' explains Jenny Town, a researcher at the Stimson Center. North Korea may see it as an opportunity to strengthen its relationship with Russia, which could provide it with access to advanced military technologies and combat experience for its officers. The regime may also expect to receive significant financial rewards for its soldiers' participation in the conflict. 'If it's true, it would be a significant development in the conflict,' said Sean Savett. 'It would be a dangerous escalation and would likely lead to further international condemnation of Russia's actions.' \nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 21, 2024 10:33 AM\nSource:[LesEchos.fr](https://www.lesechos.fr/monde/asie-pacifique/moscou-a-t-il-engage-des-soldats-nord-coreens-pour-se-battre-contre-lukraine-2126689)\n\n**North Korea Deploys Troops to Ukraine, Escalating the Conflict**\nThe war in Ukraine is on the verge of a new escalation with the direct involvement of a third country, North Korea, which could lead to an unprecedented escalation since the Russian invasion in February 2022. According to the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS), Pyongyang has decided to send 'important troops' to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine. A total of 12,000 North Korean soldiers from four brigades, including special forces, are expected to be deployed. The NIS reported that 1,500 soldiers have already arrived in Russia, transported by Russian warships between October 8 and 13. They will be stationed in military bases in the Far East, including Vladivostok, Oussouriisk, Khabarovsk, and Blagovechtchensk, and will join the front lines after their training. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that he has received information from Ukrainian intelligence services that North Korea has sent tactical personnel and officers to Ukraine, and is preparing to deploy 10,000 soldiers on its soil. 'This is the first step towards a world war,' Zelensky warned. The Russian government has dismissed the report as 'fake news.' Ukrainian military intelligence chief General Kyrylo Boudanov said that the 10,000 North Korean soldiers currently training in Russia will be ready for combat by November 1. They will use Russian equipment and ammunition, and 2,600 of the first soldiers will be sent to the Koursk region, where Ukrainian troops have occupied approximately 1,000 km² since their offensive on August 6.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 19, 2024 03:30 AM\nSource:[lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2024/10/19/guerre-en-ukraine-le-deploiement-de-soldats-nord-coreens-une-escalade-inedite_6355656_3210.html)\n\n**North Korean Soldiers to Fight in Ukraine War: A New Dimension**\nNorth Korean soldiers are being sent to Russia to fight alongside Russian forces in the Ukraine war, according to reports from the Ukrainian government and the Washington Post. This development is seen as a new dimension in the war, as a third country is now directly involved with its own troops. The North Korean soldiers are reportedly being prepared for deployment in Ukraine, with some expected to arrive as early as January 2025. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said, 'We see that the alliance between Russia and regimes like North Korea is getting stronger. It's not just about transferring weapons, but also about transferring people.' The North Korean soldiers will bring two benefits to the Russian army: their military equipment is partly outdated and similar to that used by the Russian army, and they are constantly trained and active in the military. However, there are also risks involved, such as language barriers and the fact that the soldiers will be far from home, fighting in a foreign war.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 07:35 PM\nSource:[lomazoma.com](https://lomazoma.com/nordkoreanische-soldaten-bringen-der-armee-von-wladimir-putin-zwei-vorteile/)\n\n**North Korea's Army May Soon Be Deployed in Ukraine**\nThe Russian State Duma will ratify a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement with North Korea today, which was initiated by President Vladimir Putin. The agreement includes 23 points, including joint military and economic assistance in case of aggression, cooperation in various fields such as trade, energy, and security, and joint efforts to combat international terrorism. The agreement is a result of Putin's visit to North Korea in June. The first point of the agreement may already be implemented, as Ukraine's invasion of the Kursk region is underway. The North Korean army, one of the largest in the world (1.2 million people), may receive training in the most challenging and modern conflict of the 21st century. 'I hope the Koreans will indeed appear on the front lines. Let's see what they are capable of, but I think they will be able to do a lot... And it would be nice to have heavy artillery, it won't be superfluous. We've already tried shells, and ours are better,' writes a Russian soldier in a Telegram channel. Russia has found more reliable and trustworthy allies in North Korea than in Ukraine. Pyongyang has always supported Moscow in the UN, supplies ammunition (possibly a million shots per year), including rockets, so it's natural to welcome the strengthening of ties between Russia and North Korea. The agreements between Russia and North Korea are coordinated with China, and Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belyaninov is currently in Beijing to discuss the details. Next, he will be in Pyongyang. Behind such agreements (a similar one is being prepared with Iran) lies a lot of work by Russia and China to create a military alliance against NATO, which is strengthening in the Asia-Pacific region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky could not resist the opportunity to ask the West to increase support for Ukraine, but nothing will happen in this regard until the inauguration of the new US president in January. Moscow has struck at the right moment, and Ukrainians are panicking on social media. They even discovered a base of the Korean army in the DNR. It is likely that this is a vanguard unit, as there have been no reports of the movement of personnel. In fact, Korean soldiers should be very well-trained and ideologically prepared fighters. 'Let us defend the headquarters of the revolution led by the great comrade Kim Jong-il at the cost of our lives!' reads the slogan on the flag of the Korean People's Army Navy, which appeared when Kim Jong-il was in power. The UN Security Council has been imposing sanctions on North Korea since the 2000s to slow down its nuclear program. Russia has approved and followed these sanctions until March 2024, when it vetoed the work of the sanctions group. It is expected that Russia's permanent representative to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, will raise the issue and vote against anti-North Korean sanctions at one of the next sessions. \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 03:36 PM\nSource:[eadaily.com](https://eadaily.com/ru/news/2024/10/15/pervyy-punkt-dogovora-koreyskuyu-narodnuyu-armiyu-zhdut-v-zone-svo)\n\n**North Korean Soldiers Deployed to Ukraine to Help Russia**\nThere are reports that North Korean soldiers are being deployed to Ukraine to help Russia. According to Ukrainian intelligence sources, a group of North Korean military officers were killed in a missile attack by Ukraine in the Donbas region on October 3. The attack was reportedly carried out by Ukraine in response to Russia's occupation of the region. The sources also claim that the North Korean soldiers were in Ukraine to share their experience with Russian forces. This is not the first time that there have been reports of North Korean soldiers being deployed to Ukraine. In 2023, there were reports that North Korea had sent a group of military engineers to Ukraine to help Russia. However, Russia denied these reports. In June 2024, Russia and North Korea signed a military cooperation agreement, which includes the exchange of military personnel. The agreement was signed during a visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to North Korea. The agreement includes the exchange of military personnel, including engineers and builders. The North Korean military has a large number of engineers and builders who could be deployed to Ukraine. The North Korean military has a universal military service, which includes women, and the service is mandatory for all citizens. The service lasts for 3 to 10 years, depending on the unit. In 2018, the International Institute for Strategic Studies reported that the North Korean military had around 12 million personnel, making it the fourth-largest military in the world. However, the actual number of personnel may be higher. Andrei Gubin, a military expert at the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, estimates that the North Korean military has around 8.5 million personnel, with around 6 million of them being combat-ready. The North Korean military also has a large number of reserve personnel, with around 40 million people being eligible for reserve duty. The North Korean military has a complex structure, with a large number of units and a complex chain of command. The military is also heavily dependent on Soviet-era technology, which may not be compatible with modern Russian military systems. The North Korean military has a limited ability to operate independently, and may require significant support from Russia to operate effectively in Ukraine. However, the North Korean military has a large number of personnel who could be deployed to Ukraine, and the country's military cooperation agreement with Russia could provide a framework for the deployment of North Korean soldiers to Ukraine. \nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 03:42 AM\nSource:[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/hindi/articles/cgj4p8vz10no)\n\n**North Korean Troops May Be Deployed in Ukraine: Expert's Warning**\nMilitary expert Alexander Kovalenko from the 'Informational Resistance' group believes that North Korean units may be deployed in the rear or border zone of the Russian-occupied territory. Kovalenko notes that, according to preliminary information, 20 North Korean soldiers, including 6 officers, were killed in a recent strike on Russian positions. They were likely serving as instructors for the operation and launch of North Korean KN-23 rockets. Kovalenko adds that Putin's need for human resources remains a priority, and the Russian occupation forces will be 'hypertrophied with human resources' in the coming months and in 2025, possibly including North Korean soldiers. The expert suggests that due to the language barrier, North Korean units may be deployed in the rear or border zone to relieve, for example, the Kursk or Belgorod group, or on temporarily occupied territories to perform tasks in the rear. However, Kovalenko notes that the urgent need for personnel may force the deployment of these forces on the front line, but only in specific locations where they are the only ones capable of performing the tasks. Kovalenko emphasizes that North Korean soldiers have not yet been verified as full-fledged combat formations in the Russian occupation forces. He warns that if this happens, international partners should reassess their approaches and attitudes towards the war in Ukraine, where the Ukrainian people are not only facing the totalitarian regime of Putin but also Kim Jong-un.

The officer stated that North Korean officers are already present in temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories, observing Russian forces and studying the battlefield, but Kiev has not yet seen any North Korean units fighting. The officer also noted that it is unclear where exactly Russia will deploy the North Korean combat units, but they may be used in Russia's border regions to free up Russian troops for combat in Ukraine. 'This could have a significant impact, especially if it's about releasing reserves on Russian territory,' the officer said. South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun described the reports as 'very likely' and stated that Seoul expects Pyongyang to send more personnel to support Russian military efforts. 'Russia and North Korea have an agreement that is essentially a military alliance, so it's very likely that North Korea will send additional troops. We assess it this way and will certainly prepare for it,' the minister said. In September, the head of the Ukrainian military intelligence, Budanov, reported that North Korea is supplying Russia with 'crazy amounts' of artillery ammunition, which is critical for Russia and directly affects the intensity of combat operations.

The organization stated that 'The Game Awards aim to recognize the best creative and technical work of the year, regardless of the content's release format.' This change may have significant implications for this year's nominations. Shadow of the Erdtree, the expansion of Elden Ring, may now compete in various categories, including Game of the Year. As one source noted, 'it's about time The Game Awards recognized that creativity and innovation shouldn't be limited to the 'complete game.' This decision marks a significant change from previous editions, where DLCs and expansions were indirectly recognized through the nomination of the base game in the 'Best Ongoing Game' category. The voters were already informed of this rule change before submitting their ballots, suggesting that the nominations, to be announced in a few hours, may already reflect this new inclusivity.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 16, 2024 10:56 AM\nSource:[SpazioGames](https://www.spaziogames.it/notizie/shadow-of-the-erdtree-potrebbe-vincere-il-goty)\n\n**Game Awards confirms Elden Ring DLC is GOTY eligible just days before nominations drop**\nThe Game Awards 2024 is set to announce its nominees on Monday, but just days before, the organizers have clarified that DLCs and expansions, including the upcoming Elden Ring DLC, are eligible for Game of the Year (GOTY) consideration.

    "news": "Here are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Quad hearings in aid of ICC investigation**\nFormer President Rodrigo Duterte appeared before the 11th quad committee hearing, where he was questioned about extrajudicial killings (EJKs) during his administration's war on illegal drugs. Duterte stated, 'The ICC does not scare me a bit. If I go to hell, so be it. Ginawa ko para sa bayan, para sa anak natin.' (The ICC does not scare me at all. If I go to hell, so be it. I did it for the country, for our children.) The article argues that the International Criminal Court (ICC) has no jurisdiction to investigate Duterte due to the Philippines' withdrawal from the ICC in 2019. The author claims that the ICC cannot issue a warrant for Duterte's arrest, as it would be an illegal arrest. The article also criticizes the quad committee for being a 'circus' and the House of Representatives under Speaker Martin Romualdez for being ineffective. The author predicts that former senator Antonio Trillanes IV's political career will end after May 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 01:30 PM\nSource:[Philstar.com](https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2024/11/16/2400537/quad-hearings-aid-icc-investigation)\n\n**Lavrov to Lead Russian Delegation to G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro**\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will lead the Russian delegation to the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, scheduled for November 18-19. This will allow him to meet with other international leaders who have criticized Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Although Brazilian President Vladimir Putin is under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court and Brazil is obligated to enforce it, the Brazilian government had previously expressed openness to Putin's attendance. However, Maria Zajarova, the spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has confirmed that Lavrov will lead the delegation, and he plans to speak at several sessions and hold bilateral meetings. Zajarova did not provide further details. In previous instances, other governments have sought ways to express their political discontent with Russia during the summit, but Russia's presence complicates the possibility of issuing unified and strong statements on issues like Ukraine.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 10:40 AM\nSource:[diarioestrategia.cl](https://www.diarioestrategia.cl/texto-diario/mostrar/5070219/lavrov-encabezara-delegacion-rusia-cumbre-g20)\n\n**Seeing Through the Fog of Justice in Israel and Palestine**\nThe conflict in the Middle East is plagued by misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda. This article aims to dispel false claims about the International Criminal Court (ICC) and its investigation into the situation in Palestine. Contrary to claims by Israel, the United States, and others, the ICC has jurisdiction over both Israeli officials and Palestinian leaders. In 2015, Palestine became a member-state of the ICC, and in 2021, judges determined that the ICC Prosecutor has jurisdiction over Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. As a state recognized by 149 of 193 UN member states, Palestine has the right to have its citizens investigated by the ICC, regardless of where their atrocities are perpetrated. 'The Court also has jurisdiction over any atrocities committed on Palestinian territory, irrespective of the perpetrator's nationality,' according to the ICC's jurisdiction. Former Canadian Justice Minister Irwin Cotler's claim that the ICC has jurisdiction over Palestinian citizens but not Israeli ones is false. 'These claims are false,' the article states, emphasizing the ICC's jurisdiction over both Israeli officials and Palestinian leaders.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[qoshe.com](https://qoshe.com/e-international/mark-kersten/seeing-through-the-fog-of-justice-in-israel-and-palestine/178235146)\n\n**Israel questions ICC judge's impartiality in Netanyahu arrest case**\nIsrael has questioned the impartiality of International Criminal Court judge Beti Hohler, who is reviewing a request for arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others. The Office of the Attorney-General of Israel stated that Hohler had previously worked for the Office of the Prosecutor, and 'respectfully requests that judge Beti Hohler provide information to clarify whether there are (or are not) grounds to reasonably doubt her impartiality.' The court's chief prosecutor had filed a request in May for arrest warrants against Netanyahu and others, citing reasonable grounds to believe they had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. The case has been delayed due to several rounds of legal filings by Israel challenging the court's jurisdiction, and the replacement of Romanian magistrate Iulia Motoc with Hohler. The court has no set deadlines, but generally takes about three months to rule on requests for arrest warrants.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 10:57 AM\nSource:[ksl.com](https://www.ksl.com/article/51188883/israel-questions-icc-judges-impartiality-in-netanyahu-arrest-case)\n\n**Israel Raises Concerns about Judge's Impartiality in ICC Case**\nIsrael has raised concerns about the impartiality of a judge at the International Criminal Court, which is considering whether to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This could further delay the decision, which is related to a request filed by the ICC prosecutor in May to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant, and three leaders of Hamas, due to the Gaza war. The request requires the approval of ICC judges, but the decision has been delayed due to several reasons, including multiple appeals filed by Israel challenging the court's jurisdiction. Another reason for the delay is the request by Romanian judge Julia Motoc last month to step down from the three-judge panel considering the request due to health reasons, and Slovenian judge Bettina Holzer was chosen to replace her. The Israeli Attorney General's office said in a statement on November 11 that Holzer worked in the prosecutor's office at the ICC before being appointed as a judge in December last year. The statement said, 'Israel respectfully requests that Judge Bettina Holzer provide information to clarify whether there are any grounds, or no grounds, for reasonable suspicion of her impartiality.' The statement added, 'Israel does not imply that Judge Holzer's previous work in the prosecutor's office necessarily or automatically raises logical concerns about her impartiality. However, the judges of the court have acknowledged that holding previous positions in the prosecutor's office raises reasonable concerns about bias, depending on the circumstances.' In May, the ICC prosecutor filed a request to issue arrest warrants, saying there were reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu, Galant, and the three Hamas leaders committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. Two of the Hamas leaders are now either dead or believed to be dead.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 05:30 PM\nSource:[24.ae](https://24.ae/article/857319/%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%83%D9%83-%D8%A8%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9)\n\n**Russian Court Issues Arrest Warrant for ICC Deputy President Reine Alapini-Gansou**\nThe Basmanny District Court in Moscow has issued an arrest warrant for Reine Alapini-Gansou, the deputy president of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, on the request of a prosecutor. Alapini-Gansou is accused of illegal detention and imprisonment (Article 301, Part 2 of the Russian Criminal Code) for issuing an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the court's ruling, the arrest warrant for Alapini-Gansou is valid for two months, starting from the moment of her hypothetical detention on Russian territory. Alapini-Gansou, a Beninese national, has been a judge at the ICC since March 2018 and is set to complete her term in 2027. She has a strong background in human rights, having worked with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights and the United Nations. The ICC had previously issued an arrest warrant for Putin and children's ombudsman Maria Lvova-Belova in March 2024. This is not the first time a Russian court has issued an arrest warrant for an ICC official, as the Basmanny District Court also issued a warrant for ICC judge Hailikul Bens Mahfoud in November 2024.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 04:25 PM\nSource:[rtvi.com](https://rtvi.com/news/sud-v-moskve-zaochno-arestoval-zampreda-mus-vydavshuyu-order-na-arest-putina/)\n\n**Russia Targets ICC Judges Who Issued Arrest Warrants for Putin**\nRussia continues to 'punish' International Criminal Court (ICC) judges who have issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin. In November, the Basmanny District Court in Moscow issued an arrest warrant for ICC Deputy President Reine Alapini-Gansou, citing charges of unlawful detention. The reasons for the decision were not publicly disclosed. Alapini-Gansou, a Beninese lawyer, became an ICC judge in 2018. This is not the first time Russia has targeted ICC judges. In 2022, the ICC issued arrest warrants for three former officials of the self-proclaimed Republic of South Ossetia, and in March 2024, Alapini-Gansou became the Deputy President of the ICC, succeeding Tomoko Akane, who issued an arrest warrant for Putin and authorized the detention of Russian children's ombudsman Maria Lvova-Belova. The Russian government has also put ICC President Piotr Hofmański and Tomoko Akane on the wanted list, and the Investigative Committee has issued charges against the ICC prosecutor and judge who issued the arrest warrant for Putin and Lvova-Belova.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 03:01 PM\nSource:[kritika.news/](https://www.kritika.news/u-rosi%D1%97-prodovzhuyut-mstitis-suddyam-mks-yakij-vidav-order-na-aresht-putina/)\n\n**Russian Court Issues Arrest Warrant for International Criminal Court Judge**\nThe Basmanny Court in Moscow has issued an international arrest warrant for International Criminal Court (ICC) judge Renee Alderida Sophie Alapini-Gansou, who is accused of allegedly illegally detaining individuals.

Alapini-Gansou, a Beninese lawyer, has been a judge at the ICC since March 2018. The court has issued a warrant for her arrest, and she has been put on international wanted list.

President Vladimir Putin had previously announced that he would not attend the summit this year, stating, 'I don't want to disrupt the event.' Putin believed that his presence would have disrupted the normal functioning of the forum. He added that Russia would send someone who could represent the country's interests at the summit on a high level. Brazil, a participant in the Rome Statute, which grants jurisdiction to the International Criminal Court (ICC), issued an arrest warrant for Putin in March 2023. The Kremlin stated that the warrant would not hinder Russia's relations with other countries. Brazil took over the G20 presidency on December 1, 2023, and the final summit will take place in Rio de Janeiro on November 18-19.

The planes, which conduct near-daily missions over the 25-mile-long Gaza Strip, are attempting to help Israelis identify the locations of hostages taken by Hamas over a year ago. According to the Ministry of Defence, if a formal request is made, the videos or images obtained by the planes can be handed over to the International Criminal Court as evidence of suspected war crimes committed by Israel or Hamas. The RAF's surveillance and monitoring missions began in December 2023, following Hamas's attack on the settlements known as the Gaza Envelope on October 7, 2023. Although the Ministry of Defence has not officially disclosed the type of planes or their number, the Shadow R1 plane, equipped with high-resolution electronic and visual sensors to collect data, is operating in the area. A British military source said that the Shadow R1 plane will not be able to 'monitor all of Gaza' but will be able to monitor convoys of vehicles, streets, and blocks of flats. He added, 'If the International Criminal Court comes to us and says, 'We believe there is a war crime in this area,' and asks if we have any footage, the government's response will be, 'Yes, we do, and we will provide it.' Between December 2023 and June 2024, the Royal Air Force conducted over 250 flights near Gaza. The International Criminal Court has requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, stating that there are 'reasonable grounds' to believe they are responsible for crimes against humanity and other crimes. Israel has killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza and cut off vital aid. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said, 'In line with our international commitments, we will consider any formal request from the International Criminal Court to provide information related to investigations into war crimes.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 26, 2024 07:02 PM\nSource:[egypt-today.com](https://www.egypt-today.com/314/170214-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%8A-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%8B-%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%85-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9)\n\n**Putin Proposes Way to Avoid ICC Arrest Warrants through Intergovernmental Agreement**\nRussian President Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) can be resolved by signing a intergovernmental agreement. He made this comment in the context of a possible trip to Brazil for the G20 summit, according to RIA Novosti. Putin noted that 'decisions of this kind are very easy to circumvent, it's quite simple. All you need to do is sign an intergovernmental agreement, and the ICC's jurisdiction will be limited.' He emphasized that Russia and Brazil have had strong and stable relations for many years, creating conditions for signing necessary documents without creating complex situations for the parties involved. However, Putin announced that he will not attend the G20 summit in Brazil, citing the need to avoid disrupting the work of the summit. He added that the Russian authorities will determine who will represent the country at the summit at a high level. Since December 1, 2023, Brazil has taken over the presidency of G20, and the final summit will take place in Rio de Janeiro on November 18-19.

Putin stated, 'We understand perfectly that, including or excluding the TPI factor, all the discussion will be only about that. And that would disturb the work of the G20. Why? We are adults!' The Brazilian government had been trying to provide guarantees for Putin's visit without being arrested, but the efforts were unsuccessful. Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira stated, 'I cannot limit or restrict a judge, nor imagine or guess what they will do. There may be other things that can happen.'

The Brazilian government has been working to make Putin's visit to the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro possible this fall, despite an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court. According to Folha de S.Paulo, the Brazilian government submitted a document with legal arguments in favor of Putin's visit to the UN Human Rights Commission in November last year. The commission is currently working on developing provisions for the immunity of heads of state, which would guarantee that leaders of countries are not subject to prosecution during international visits. The International Criminal Court, which Russia does not recognize, issued an arrest warrant for Putin and children's ombudsman Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing Russia of 'deportation' of children who were rescued from Ukrainian shelling and evacuated to safe areas. Peskov called the ICC's decision to issue an arrest warrant for Putin 'unacceptable,' saying that Moscow does not recognize the court's jurisdiction and considers its decisions to be null and void.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 09:54 AM\nSource:[РИА Новости](https://ria.ru/20241002/peskov-1975923401.html)\n\n**Guinea Ecuatorial Invites Putin to Visit Despite Not Complying with International Criminal Court Decisions**\nGuinea Ecuatorial's President Teodoro Obiang has invited Russian President Vladímir Putin to visit the African country, which has not signed the International Criminal Court's founding treaty and has not complied with its decisions, including the arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes in Ukraine. 'We are willing to host the Russia-Africa summit in our modern city of Malabo. We have all the necessary infrastructure,' Obiang said during an intervention in the Russian Duma. The African leader, who is visiting Russia for the second time in less than a year, added that he would like to have the participation of Russian deputies if the event takes place, and particularly 'the excellence of Vladímir Putin, whose personal presence would be a great honor for our people.' Obiang noted that 'Guinea Ecuatorial has not signed any cooperation agreement with the International Criminal Court, so we have all the necessary conditions' for Putin to visit the country without risk of being detained. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin in March 2023 for his alleged role in the systematic deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia, which has imposed significant restrictions on Putin's ability to travel. Obiang will participate today alongside Putin in the plenary session of the Russian Energy Week (REN) being held in Moscow until Saturday. In November last year, Obiang met with Putin at the Kremlin leader's country house on the outskirts of Moscow (Novo-Ogariovo).\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 26, 2024 11:18 AM\nSource:[Infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/agencias/2024/09/26/obiang-invita-a-putin-a-guinea-ecuatorial-que-no-cumple-las-decisiones-de-la-cpi)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The US is the largest donor of global health aid, providing $15.8 billion in 2022, and restrictions on this aid can have significant consequences. Trump is expected to reinstate the Mexico City Policy, also known as the global gag rule, which bans organizations providing abortion services from receiving US aid. This policy has been shown to have devastating effects on women's health, including increased maternal and child mortality, reduced access to contraception, and increased rates of unsafe abortions. Research has shown that when the global gag rule is in place, health organizations are forced to close services, stocks of contraceptives decline, and organizations stop providing services to reduce death from unsafe abortions. Leading reproductive health charity Marie Stopes International saw its funding fall by 17% in 2017 due to its refusal to agree to the terms of the global gag rule. It is critical that donors, especially those in Europe, announce their plans to step up their support to protect women's health and access to safe abortions, in order to prevent the closure of vital services. 'These restrictions create the precise opposite of what they set out to achieve, resulting in more abortions and more deaths. But more than that, they are deeply harmful and dangerous to women who have no say over a policy that presents a danger to their lives,' said a researcher.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 05:40 PM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/how-a-second-trump-presidency-is-likely-to-threaten-abortion-rights-and-womens-healthcare-globally-243346)\n\n**Trump Picks RFK As Health Secretary, Xi In Peru, Most Polluting City**\nDonald Trump has selected vaccine skeptic Robert F.

Machado stated, 'One thing is a negotiation before January 10 and another thing is a negotiation after. For the regime, if they cling to power, the situation will be substantially more complex from that day on.' She emphasized that the Plataforma Unitaria Democrática (PUD) is working to create pressure, both inside and outside the country, to ensure that Edmundo González Urrutia, the PUD's candidate, is sworn in as president-elect in January. Machado believes that there is still time for a negotiation with Maduro, but that it must focus on a 'regime change' that ends the chavismo that has governed since 1999. She noted that Maduro's support is 'infinitesimal' among security forces, civilians, and military personnel, and that many actors close to the regime are aware that the sooner they negotiate, the better their situation will be. Machado stated, 'I truly believe that after January 10, the scenario changes completely.

The character of the military aid, particularly the provision of long-range weapons to Ukraine, will not change. Ayzenberg is confident that the Biden administration will not allow Ukraine to strike targets deep in Russia with American weapons, as this could lead to a nuclear attack by Russia. The expert expects that the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump will have a different policy towards Europe and Ukraine, which may lead to a decrease in support for Ukraine. Ayzenberg also notes that the position of the European Union on Ukraine will be influenced by the upcoming elections in European countries, which may lead to a shift to the right and a decrease in support for Ukraine. However, he also mentions that there are some exceptions among European politicians, such as the President of Poland Andrzej Duda and the Prime Minister of Italy Giorgia Meloni, who support Ukraine despite being from right-wing parties.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 10:51 AM\nSource:[uatv.ua](https://uatv.ua/uspeet-li-administratsiya-ssha-do-kontsa-kadentsii-predostavit-ukraine-ranee-vydelennuyu-pomoshh-mnenie-ajzenberga/)\n\n**Scholz Calls for Passage of Several Projects Before Early Elections**\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for the approval of several projects in the parliament before the upcoming early elections.

He explained that the country is heading towards an election campaign, but noted that there are projects that can be agreed upon and have a democratic majority in the parliament. Scholz specifically mentioned the measures to alleviate the burdens related to the 'cold progress' on income tax, which is expected to come into effect on January 1, 2025. He also emphasized the need to speed up the approval of the government's growth initiative and to increase the child allowance by early 2025. Additionally, Scholz mentioned the need to amend the Basic Law to make the federal constitutional law more capable of addressing potential political influences. This comes after a week of the collapse of the governing coalition, following the withdrawal of the Free Democratic Party, the junior partner, from the coalition government. Scholz announced in his statement that he will request a vote of confidence in the government on December 16, paving the way for early parliamentary elections in late February 2025, about seven months before the scheduled regular elections in late September of the same year.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 03:45 PM\nSource:[جريدة الشروق](https://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=13112024&id=5857274f-cea3-430e-a47b-6db9695c886e)\n\n**German President Names 'Realistic Date' for Parliamentary Elections**\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has named 'a realistic date' for parliamentary elections as February 23, 2025, according to his official website.

Simonovis emphasized that a negotiation with the chavismo to consolidate the opposition's 'break' with the regime should be with Vladimir Padrino López, as he is the one who can convince Maduro that the military will no longer support him, thus ending the revolution and dictatorship. Simonovis is convinced that the military wants to negotiate because they know that those who will be in trouble during a transition are those who have violated human rights, and the majority of the FAN is not implicated.

Miesbach - After the collapse of the coalition government, the country is expecting new elections. Many are calling for these to be held as soon as possible in January. We asked Sandra Bauer, election official in Miesbach, how this would affect the election offices in the region and how much lead time a typical election requires. 'It's already a topic in our election office,' Bauer said. 'Since Thursday morning, preparations have been underway. I have parallel tasks as a civil servant and in the order office. Next week, I will move to a different office.' The federal election official has already said that new elections in January are possible. 'In principle, yes,' Bauer said. 'But for the election offices, it would be crucial to set a date for the new elections soon, because an election is associated with a huge amount of work. The rooms for the polling stations must be reserved in good time, so that no other event takes place there. We need to recruit election helpers. Fortunately, the city of Miesbach has a good pool of election helpers, and we always appoint election helpers, but it's a bit more difficult to do so at short notice. I also have to create the voter register, send out the election notices, and send out the postal vote documents. This takes some time. It can take up to two weeks for the election notices to be sent out. The notices must be sent out at least 21 days before the election. In addition, the parties are allowed to put up posters six weeks before the election. By then, the election boards must be in place. If we have snow in winter, this is a bit tight.' Bauer has never experienced early new elections before. 'No,' she said. 'In 2008, I was the deputy election official for the first time. Since 2018, I have been the community election official. Since then, I have often expected it, but it never happened.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 09, 2024 04:51 PM\nSource:[Merkur.de](https://www.merkur.de/lokales/region-miesbach/miesbach-wahlleiterin-landkreis-neuwahlen-ampel-regierung-wahlamt-entscheidend-termin-feststeht-93401526.html)\n\n**Scholz Faces Pressure for Early Election as CDU and CSU Push for New Vote**\nThe CDU and CSU are putting pressure on Chancellor Olaf Scholz to hold a new election, which could lead to a earlier date for the confidence vote in the Bundestag. Scholz had previously stated that he would hold the confidence vote on January 15, 2025, but is now open to discussing an earlier date. However, there are significant hurdles to overcome, including the 60-day timeframe for the election, which would be shortened if the vote were held during the Christmas season or between the years. The Bundeswahlleiterin, Ruth Brand, has warned that a premature election could lead to 'unabwägbare Risiken auf allen Ebenen' and make it difficult to implement necessary measures. The Bundeswahlgesetz also poses a challenge, as it requires that election proposals for the constituencies and party lists be submitted 69 days before the election. CDU leader Friedrich Merz has called for the election to be held on January 19, 2025, just one day before the inauguration of the new US government. 'Am 20. Januar 2025, einem Montag, wird die neue amerikanische Regierung ins Amt treten', Merz said. 'Am 19. Januar könnte man in Deutschland Neuwahlen machen.

In reality, no one knows what will happen in the next two months, with desires and threats abound, and prophecies are plentiful. The online communication noise is high, but important events in history are complicated by the interests of those involved and are always unpredictable. The geopolitical context is complex, and as a country in the world, we weigh little, despite our oil and gold reserves. As an economy, we are among the last in the world. As a society, misfortunes abound, and pains are numerous, and it's not necessary to explain them because every Venezuelan worker and household has lived through them for many years, including forced emigration. In politics, there is only confusion, with a great fear and a great hope at the same time. The psychological climate is highly destabilizing for our psyche and daily life. As Immanuel Kant said, 'To prophesize is foolish,' but the future cannot be ignored, and we all need a horizon of life and goals. Politically, most of us made our decision on July 28 by voting for a democratic, necessary, and urgent change. Making it possible on January 10, in peace, is a general desire, but it will depend on the regime, whether it listens to the country or continues to listen to itself. The current situation of threats and repression is unsustainable in the long term, and the sensible thing is the transition proposed, with serious and realistic negotiations in the framework of mutual respect and with the constitution as a guarantee of compliance. Insisting on this may seem naive or idealistic, but history tells us that it is the best way to avoid greater evils. Thinking about the country, rather than our personal interests, and the common good, is necessary and sensible, and I still believe, despite everything, that politics and government are rational, civil, civic, and constitutional things. Moving from Machiavelli and Hobbes to Montesquieu, and from the 'man wolf' to politics and government as a matter of honest and competent people, subordinate to the constitution and right justice, and not to the tariffed, is allowed. Democratic alternability is vital for a robust democracy, and absolute respect for popular sovereignty.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 09, 2024 06:21 AM\nSource:[lapatilla.com/](https://www.lapatilla.com/2024/11/09/angel-lombardi-navegando-incertidumbres/)\n\n**Germany May Change Its Economic Policy as Early as January**\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz is facing increasing pressure to agree to early elections in January. According to a new ARD poll, two-thirds of voters want to hold national elections as soon as possible, while business groups are calling for an end to political turmoil. Scholz's decision to fire Finance Minister Christian Lindner, a representative of the FDP, has destroyed the 'Traffic Light' coalition (SPD, FDP, and Greens) and left the government without a majority in the lower house of parliament. The leader of the CDU, Friedrich Merz, and Lindner are both calling for early elections to end Germany's economic stagnation. Industrial lobbyists are also supporting the call for January elections, saying that 'every day with this government is a day wasted.' The SPD, Scholz's own party, also wants early elections. Scholz is advocating for elections in March, and is willing to face a vote of no confidence to allow President Steinmeier to dissolve the government. The CDU is leading in opinion polls, with over 30% of the vote, giving them a strong chance of winning the chancellorship after their defeat by the SPD three years ago. Other parties and factions are also supporting early elections, but for different reasons. It's worth noting that early elections in January would be a blessing for Germany, as the country will face an energy crisis starting in 2025 due to the end of Russian gas transit through Ukraine. Although Germany has stopped using Russian methane, it would be beneficial for the country to resume gas exports from Russia through the remaining 'Nord Stream 2' pipeline. However, it's unlikely that the right and conservatives will agree to this, but the left, represented by the Greens, have repeatedly expressed support for resuming direct gas supplies from Russia.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 03:27 PM\nSource:[oilcapital.ru](https://oilcapital.ru/news/2024-11-08/germaniya-mozhet-pomenyat-svoyu-ekonomicheskuyu-politiku-uzhe-v-yanvare-5243909)\n\n**Russian Elites Hope for Quick End to War with Trump Presidency**\nRussian elites are counting on a quick end to the war, with some even suggesting that a Donald Trump presidency could lead to a peaceful resolution. According to sources close to the Russian government, Trump's election could bring about a change in the US stance on Ukraine, with the US exerting pressure on Kyiv to accept a compromise. 'When Donald Trump takes office, we can agree to start consultations,' said a Russian official. 'It would be convenient for him to negotiate, and there is no one to talk to now.' The sources also suggest that the Russian military will intensify its attacks on Ukraine in the coming months, with the goal of capturing as much territory as possible by January 2025, when Trump is expected to take office. 'We will advance before the inauguration [of Trump],' said a Russian official. 'It would be good to reach the administrative borders of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions by January.' Another official noted that if the Russian military is successful in its advances, and Ukraine retreats, it would be logical for the new US administration to suggest starting negotiations. 'When Donald Trump takes office and forms his team, we can agree to start consultations,' said the official. 'It would be convenient for him to negotiate.' However, not all Russian officials are optimistic about the prospects for a peaceful resolution. 'There will be no immediate turnaround,' said a source close to the Russian Foreign Ministry. 'Trump is also part of the system, and there will be no radical change.'\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 08:18 AM\nSource:[Onet Wiadomości](https://wiadomosci.onet.pl/swiat/nieoficjalnie-elity-kremla-licza-na-negocjacje-z-trumpem/541yhrv)\n\n**Medvedev: US Presidential Elections Will Not Change Russia's Situation**\nRussian Deputy Security Council Chairman Dmitry Medvedev stated that the upcoming US presidential elections will not change the current situation for Russia. According to Medvedev, Russia has no reason to have high expectations from the elections, as the positions of the candidates reflect the two-party consensus on the need for Russia's defeat. 'For Russia, the elections will change nothing, since the positions of the candidates fully reflect the two-party consensus on the need for our country's defeat,' Medvedev wrote in his Telegram channel. Former US Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker stated that if Trump wins the election, he may demand that Russian President Vladimir Putin withdraw Russian troops from the special operation zone. However, Volker noted that there are differing views on the conflict in Ukraine within Trump's administration, and Trump himself does not want to see the Kiev regime's defeat during his presidency. Trump has repeatedly stated that he can quickly resolve the conflict in Ukraine, and even claimed that he can do so before his inauguration in January 2025. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov welcomed any peaceful initiatives that could lead to a desired outcome, but emphasized that the conflict's root causes must be addressed for a full resolution. Putin stated that Russia is willing to make reasonable compromises to resolve the conflict, but the outcome must be in Russia's favor and take into account the country's realities.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 03, 2024 05:09 AM\nSource:[regnum.ru](https://regnum.ru/news/3927033)\n\n**UK to Introduce New Electronic Travel Authorization System in 2025**\nThe United Kingdom will introduce a new Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) system for foreign visitors starting from 2025. The system will cover citizens of many countries, including those from the European Union (EU) and the United States (US). ETA applications will be made online and will be valid for two years. The application fee is set at 10 pounds. The ETA system aims to enhance the UK's border security and control the entry and exit of the country more effectively. This application is similar to the US ESTA system and the EU's ETIAS system. ETA will allow visitors to undergo security screening before their trip, helping to detect potential threats beforehand. The system will be phased in by 2025. Initially, ETA will be applied to citizens of seven Middle Eastern countries, and from January 2025, it will also cover citizens of the US, Australia, Japan, and Hong Kong. From April 2025, it will be mandatory for EU citizens. Irish citizens will be exempt from this application. This new regulation is also important for Turkish citizens planning to travel to the UK. Since the ETA system covers visitors from visa-exempt countries, there will be no change in the current visa application process for Turkish citizens.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 02, 2024 10:01 AM\nSource:[turizmajansi.com](https://www.turizmajansi.com/haber/ingiltere-de-yeni-seyahat-izni-uygulamasi-h67298)\n\n**Belarusian Regime Warns Former Prisoners Ahead of Presidential Elections**\nAccording to Euroradio.fm, the Belarusian regime is summoning former political prisoners to the militia before the presidential elections scheduled for January next year, where they receive 'official warnings' not to plan actions aimed at changing the government. The former prisoners, who have served sentences under 'political' articles or still have restrictions on their freedom, are required to sign a written commitment not to plan actions aimed at 'forcibly changing the constitutional order, seizing or maintaining power using unconstitutional methods.' Euroradio notes that it is unclear what specific actions are being referred to. The authorities have set the date for the new presidential elections on January 26, 2025. Since the rigged elections in 2020 and the refusal of Western countries to recognize Alexander Lukashenko as the winner, Belarus has been experiencing repression.

Therefore, from 2025, Ukraine will officially join the list of countries that do not change their clocks, neither in winter nor in summer. Italy, Spain, and other European Union countries will continue to change their clocks at least until 2026, when the European Parliament is expected to make a final decision.

He stated this during a live broadcast. 'Thank you to the government, thank you to the minister. By the end of the week, the central MSEC in Kyiv should be liquidated', he said. Raduts'kyi emphasized that the central MSEC in Kyiv plans to be liquidated by the end of the week, while regional MSEC will continue to work under the old system until the end of the year. He hopes that new approaches to control will reduce the risk of scandals in this area. 'But under the control that will be there today, I hope that by the end of the year, there will be no loud scandals. I don't think these people are immortal and fearless. They need to understand that the whole country is watching them. So, I think it will be a bit easier. Because we cannot leave people without such a commission today', Raduts'kyi noted. He explained that 'we cannot say today that there is no MSEC, wait until January 1, while something new appears'. He also announced that the functions of the central MSEC in Kyiv, including control and consideration of complaints, will now be performed by the Institute of the Ministry of Health in Dnipro. This decision was made after the dismissal of the leaders, which took place on the backdrop of scandals. Raduts'kyi added that the government is doing everything possible to ensure that citizens do not feel the transition period in the MSEC system until the planned changes.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 08:01 AM\nSource:[sud.ua](https://sud.ua/uk/news/ukraine/313920-regionalni-msek-pratsyuvatimut-do-1-sichnya-po-stariy-sistemi-mikhaylo-radutskiy)\n\n**Tight Schedule for Future Government's Budget 2025**\nThe future government of Michel Barnier will have to pass its budget through Parliament before January 1st and give it 70 days of debate. If it is not adopted before the end of the year, the functioning of the state will not be completely hindered, but it will have limitations. The countdown to the budget has started with several weeks of delay. According to the official calendar, the government should have already deposited its draft budget before the Council of State, before the official presentation in the Council of Ministers in mid-September, and then before the National Assembly on the first Tuesday of October. However, everything will be delayed due to the lack of a government. Two rules remain unchanged: the budget requires 70 days of debate and must be definitively adopted by December 31st at the latest. Without a budget by January 1st, 2025, the state could still continue to function. 'The principle of continuity of the life of the nation means that a government, even without a budget, can continue to pay civil servants, finance public services, based on the absence of income because, to collect taxes, it needs the authorization of Parliament', explains Benjamin Morel, a political scientist and professor at the University of Paris II.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 21, 2024 09:50 PM\nSource:[Franceinfo](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/economie/budget/budget-2025-un-calendrier-tres-serre-pour-le-futur-gouvernement_6767155.html)\n\n**Russia and Belarus May Abolish Roaming from January 1, 2025**\nAccording to Alexey Polischuk, director of the second department of CIS countries at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Russian and Belarusian mobile users in the Union State will be provided with communication services at comfortable rates, comparable to those in the mobile networks of both countries, starting from January 1, 2025.

Both Nicolás Maduro, re-elected president, and Edmundo González Urrutia, his main contender, have stated that they will be sworn in before the National Assembly on that day. González Urrutia clarified that he will not be sworn in in exile, saying 'No es un escenario que lo tengo planteado en este momento. Mi juramentación es ante la Asamblea Nacional en Venezuela.' Maduro, on the other hand, has received an invitation from the Parliament to take office in January and has stated that he will 'Asistiré formalmente al cumplimiento del juramento constitucional.' Analysts believe that Maduro will likely start another term, as 'las opciones son absolutamente limitadas para la oposición si hablamos de ejercer el poder en el territorio venezolano y de materializar el control de las instituciones.' Benigno Alarcón, director of the Center for Political and Government Studies at the Universidad Católica Andrés Bello, suggests that the results of the July 28 election, which are still not detailed by the CNE, will be the factor of change within the political system. He also warns that if Maduro is sworn in, the people may lose interest in the electoral process and not attend future elections, leading to a 'espejismo electoral'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 20, 2024 06:00 AM\nSource:[Efecto Cocuyo](http://efectococuyo.com/politica/10-de-enero-la-nueva-fecha-clave-para-la-politica-venezolana/)\n\n**María Corina Machado: 'We're taking steps towards our freedom, but it's a hard road'**\nMaría Corina Machado, leader of the Plataforma Unitaria, told millions of Venezuelans that they are living in dark times, but assured that they are taking important steps towards achieving the country's freedom.

According to the Constitution, a new presidential mandate is scheduled for January 10, 2025. However, the CNE proclaimed Nicolás Maduro as the winner of the July 28 elections, and the chavismo has already stated that he will swear in before the National Assembly, despite the disputed results at the national and international levels.

The reform will be applied from January 1, 2025, retroactively. In a press conference, Ramiro Gonzalez, the president of Araba, Elixabete Etxanobe, the president of Bizkaia, and Eider Mendoza, the president of Gipuzkoa, were asked about the reform. In Araba and Bizkaia, the law will be presented before the end of the year. However, in Gipuzkoa, it is 'impossible' to present the reform before the end of the year, according to Mendoza, who also stated that Gipuzkoa is the only region that has formed a committee to examine the changes in taxes. The changes will be similar in the three regions, as the councils have a 'national perspective', but 'harmonization is not the same as unification', and small adjustments can be made in each region. The parliamentary process will not have a special impact on the Bizkaia Foral Council, as the EAJ and PSE-EE have a majority in the Basque Parliament. However, Etxanobe has extended her hand to the opposition. Regarding the offer made by EH Bildu to reach a general budget agreement in the institutions, Mendoza and Gonzalez, who are the two regional presidents who need an agreement, have considered it positive, although they have emphasized that the decision-making area is the region. 'Citizens ask for agreements to be reached', said Mendoza, and reminded that they have been negotiating with opposition parties in several areas since before the summer. 'If there is no agreement, we will not try', he added. Gonzalez has announced that the opposition will 'link' the fiscal reform to the budget negotiations, and although the two issues are separate, he does not see any obstacles to combining them. He hopes that the lack of elections in the short term will facilitate reaching an agreement.\nOriginal language: eu\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 05:33 PM\nSource:[eitb.eus/](https://www.eitb.eus/eu/albisteak/ekonomia/osoa/9605611/zerga-fiskala-ez-da-2025era-arte-onartuko/)\n\n**Akhara Parishad Proposes Renaming Shahi Snan and Peshwai at MahaKumbh 2025**\nThe Akhara Parishad has proposed renaming the Shahi Snan and Peshwai at the MahaKumbh 2025.

Sheinbaum stated that these changes aim to save money in the budget approved by the Mexican Congress each year for each department within the bureaucratic structure. Additionally, she explained that the changes also aim to work better with the new social programs she promised during her presidential campaign, such as economic support for women between 60 and 64 years old, children in basic education, and others. 'We will reduce government spending even more and also change its organizational structure so that it can work better with the new programs,' she expressed.

The names of populated areas containing Russian and Soviet norms or Russianized names, such as Puschino, Michurin, Maxim Gorky, Kutuzovka, Suvorovo, and Nekrasovo, will be changed. Additionally, many names related to Soviet holidays or Soviet symbolism, such as Peretrovanka, Peremayske, and Maevka, will be renamed.

The resolution was put to a vote in the Verkhovna Rada, but was initially blocked by some deputies. The renaming of streets and the removal of monuments to Soviet and Russian figures in Ukraine began in 2015 after the adoption of the 'decommunization' law. A new wave of anti-Russian and anti-Soviet sentiment swept the country in 2022, and in March 2023, the Verkhovna Rada passed a law on 'decolonization' of topographic names, requiring local authorities to change all geographic names related to Russia and the Soviet period.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 19, 2024 10:06 AM\nSource:[ТАСС](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/21906385)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

According to the CDC, workers on dairy farms face a transmission risk when exposed to infected cows or raw milk from acutely infected cows. Researchers from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment found that PPE use increased by 28% after detection of the A(H5N1) virus, with eye protection while milking cows showing the greatest increase (40%). The CDC recommends that workers wear fluid-resistant coveralls, a NIOSH-approved particulate respirator, goggles, and other protective gear. The agency suggests that providing PPE to farms before outbreaks occur could help prevent human cases of A(H5N1).

The USDA is ramping up testing and monitoring for the virus, with a focus on biosecurity and containment measures. Amber Itle, Washington's state veterinarian, emphasizes the importance of staying alert for sudden illness and deaths in flocks and taking steps in biosecurity. The virus has been devastating farm animals since 2022, with widespread outbreaks in wild birds and recent human cases among U.S. dairy and poultry workers. New detections have been reported in Oregon, Washington, Utah, and California, with 105.2 million poultry affected and 492 dairy herds infected nationwide.

The testing will start in states where the H5N1 virus has been identified, and then expand to states where it has not been confirmed. If bulk samples test positive, testing will be narrowed down to the farm level to track and monitor the disease. This move comes after the U.S. Animal Health Association and the American Association of Bovine Practitioners emphasized the need for a coordinated state and federal surveillance plan. The virus has slowed its spread since the spring, but new cases have been confirmed in California, Idaho, and Utah. Colorado implemented mandatory weekly milk testing in July and has seen no new cases since August. The nation's largest dairy state, California, has seen 223 confirmed cases of HPAI since August, representing more than half of the country's total confirmed cases.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 08:01 AM\nSource:[hoards.com](https://hoards.com/article-35865-bulk-milk-testing-for-hpai-to-begin.html)\n\n**USDA to Test Raw Milk for Avian Influenza**\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has launched a monitoring initiative to detect the presence of the H5N1 virus in raw milk at the wholesale level, in response to the increase in cases of avian influenza among farm animals. The goal is to contain the rapid spread of the virus in dairy farms and protect the health of agricultural workers who are in constant contact with infected animals. According to the USDA, the virus has been detected in over 400 farms in various regions of the US, with California being one of the states with the highest incidence, accounting for over 200 cases. The USDA has implemented a multi-step strategy to collect milk samples and evaluate the presence of the virus H5N1 in these productions. The agency explained that the objective of this approach is twofold: to reduce the spread of the virus and to decrease the risk of occupational exposure for those working with infected animals. 'The data collected so far have shown that H5N1 can be transmitted through equipment, people, and other elements that circulate between farms, affecting both dairy farms and poultry facilities,' the agency stated. The detection of the first pig infected with H5N1 in Oregon has raised concerns about the risk of the virus eventually adapting to infect humans. Scientists at the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) have performed genetic sequencing of the virus found in this pig and in the birds of the farm where the outbreak originated. So far, no mutations have been detected that indicate an increase in the virus's ability to transmit to humans. However, this finding has intensified monitoring and control efforts, as the meat and agricultural industries have expressed concern about the economic and public health impact that an expansion of the virus could generate. The USDA's decision to implement large-scale testing of raw milk has been influenced by the agricultural industry's push to strengthen surveillance efforts. A pilot program in Colorado has shown positive results, reducing new cases of avian influenza in dairy cows. The experience in Colorado has been key to expanding this program to other affected areas and promoting control policies in other dairy farms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported that 35 people have been infected with the virus, although no cases related to milk consumption have been confirmed. As for the risks to consumers, health authorities assure that pasteurization of milk eliminates the H5N1 virus, representing an effective measure to ensure the safety of dairy products. However, raw unpasteurized milk remains a concern due to the potential for contamination, not only with avian influenza but also with pathogens such as E. coli and Salmonella. The CDC and USDA strongly recommend that consumers avoid consuming raw milk, especially in these high-risk moments. The USDA's decision to analyze raw milk at the wholesale level marks a significant step in containing avian influenza in the livestock sector, as well as a preventive measure to protect both the industry and consumers. In collaboration with state authorities and agricultural industry actors, the USDA seeks to establish a robust and continuous monitoring network that allows for rapid response to new outbreaks and minimizes the effects of this highly contagious virus. With these actions, authorities aim to reduce the spread of H5N1 in the country and protect both agricultural workers and consumers of dairy products, in a context where food safety has become a growing priority.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 01:04 AM\nSource:[La Opinión Digital](https://laopinion.com/2024/11/05/el-usda-lanzara-pruebas-de-leche-cruda-para-detectar-contaminacion-por-gripe-aviar/)\n\n**Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza confirmed in Jackson County**\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) confirmed Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in a backyard flock of geese and chickens in Jackson County, Oregon. This is the first confirmed case of HPAI in Jackson County. According to the USDA, HPAI detections are higher in the fall and spring due to wild birds spreading the virus during migration. Since May 2022, 38 backyard flocks and three commercial poultry flocks have been affected in Oregon. Dr. Ryan Scholz, Oregon Department of Agriculture's State Veterinarian, placed the Jackson County farm under quarantine and humanely euthanized all poultry on the property. The USDA stated, 'None of the animals on the farm entered the food supply chain, nor were they intended for the commercial food market.' The CDC recommends choosing pasteurized milk and dairy products to protect health. To prevent the spread of the virus, bird and livestock owners can take biosecurity measures such as preventing exposure to wildlife, limiting co-mingling of different species, and sanitizing equipment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 02, 2024 09:38 PM\nSource:[nbc16.com](https://www.nbc16.com/news/local/highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-confirmed-in-jackson-county)\n\n**USDA improves H5N1 testing and monitoring efforts for dairy cattle**\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is enhancing its testing and monitoring efforts to protect dairy cattle from the H5N1 avian influenza. Following its detection in dairy herds in March 2024, the USDA is collaborating with state veterinarians to implement a tiered strategy for collecting bulk milk samples. This approach has already shown success, reducing the number of states reporting H5N1 from 14 to 2 in the past month. USDA officials emphasize the need for additional measures to enhance biosecurity and protect farm workers from potential exposure. Historically, bulk milk testing has proven effective in controlling livestock diseases, and the USDA plans to extend this approach to other regions and states. Farmers are urged to prioritize biosecurity measures, and the USDA is advancing the development of an H5N1 vaccine for dairy cows, with two candidates currently undergoing field trials.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2024 11:24 AM\nSource:[openaccessgovernment.org](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/usda-improves-h5n1-testing-and-monitoring-efforts-for-dairy-cattle/184542/)\n\n**Avian flu spreads to Utah dairies as APHIS rolls out new testing**\nThe Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) has confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in eight commercial dairy facilities in Cache County.

State veterinarian Dr. Daniel Christensen stated, 'At this time we don’t anticipate any major impacts on the food supply and the overall impacts to individual dairies are relatively minimal.' The UDAF is actively collaborating with dairy producers and partners to implement response plans, surveillance, and testing measures to protect against HPAI spread. The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has confirmed an additional nine H5N1 outbreaks on California dairy farms, bringing the national total to 404.

According to Richard Webby, an infectious disease researcher, reassortment alone cannot create a virus capable of launching a human pandemic, but it could help move the virus from an infected human's eye to their respiratory tract. Webby says that the virus would need to accrue specific mutations to become more transmissible among humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged farm workers to get their seasonal flu shots, and the U.S. has a stockpile of H5N1 vaccines, but it has not yet distributed any. Some scientists have called for vaccinating cattle against H5N1, and the USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics has approved a couple of vaccine field safety trials. 'It's not a bright-line rule,' said the CDC's principal deputy director Nirav Shah.

The Oregon Department of Agriculture reported on Friday that the first case of H5N1 had been detected in a pig on a farm in the state. National veterinary services laboratories at the USDA confirmed on Tuesday that one of the five pigs on the farm was infected with the H5N1 virus, marking the first detection of the virus in pigs in the United States. The farm has been quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus. The other animals on the farm, including sheep and goats, are being monitored, according to the USDA. The farm is a non-commercial operation and the animals were not intended for commercial meat production. 'This discovery does not raise any concerns about the safety of the country's pork supply,' the USDA said in a statement. Two field trials have been approved for candidate vaccines to protect dairy cows against the H5N1 virus, it added.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 06:48 AM\nSource:[Les nouvelles à travers la Chine et le monde](http://french.xinhuanet.com/20241031/ee5d4b76a1884c34a505e760b57e434a/c.html)\n\n**USDA to Expand Avian Flu Testing in Raw Milk**\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) will begin testing raw milk for avian flu in bulk across the country, a significant expansion of the agency's efforts to contain the rapid spread of the virus, said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. The move comes after farmers and veterinarians pressured the USDA to strengthen its current surveillance approach, which they deemed inadequate to contain the virus, according to state records and industry documents. Starting in early November, the agency will begin taking samples of milk in states where dairy cattle have contracted avian flu, including tests in specific farms as needed to track the spread of the virus, Vilsack said in an interview. Additionally, the USDA will begin testing in states that have not identified the virus in dairy cows. The rapid spread of the virus in California, where nearly 200 dairy herds have tested positive since late August, contributed to the USDA's decision that more surveillance efforts are needed, Vilsack said. 'These situations evolve over time and, as they evolve, it is necessary to recalibrate and adjust,' Vilsack added. The effort comes on top of an emergency order issued in April that requires testing of cattle moving across state borders, and a USDA program that covers the costs of voluntary testing for farmers. It was previously reported that the USDA had relaxed those rules after opposition from state officials and industry representatives. Avian flu has infected nearly 400 dairy herds in 14 states and at least 36 people, according to data and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Virologists and federal health officials are also concerned about the convergence of avian flu and seasonal flu that could allow the avian flu virus to mutate if people become co-infected, making it more easily transmissible between humans. Some dairy farmers in states have resisted voluntary testing of their animals due to fear of economic repercussions. More context: State and industry contributions allow EU to reduce avian flu testing in livestock 'We cannot wait for a virus to die out. That strategy has not worked,' said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, which has been involved in discussions about the new recommendations. The American Association of Bovine Practitioners (AABP) also drafted in September recommendations on how the USDA could better contain the virus, with weekly tests of milk tankers, among other strategies, according to emails and a copy of the draft obtained from the Missouri Department of Agriculture in a public records request. 'The disease is still spreading and the current voluntary surveillance is inadequate,' wrote the AABP's executive director, K. Fred Gingrich II, in a group email on September 28. He noted that only 50 of the country's 27,000 dairy herds were enrolled in the USDA's voluntary herd testing program at the time, and that 17.6 million commercial poultry had been slaughtered after the herds tested positive for the bovine variant of avian flu, suggesting that dairy farms are fueling the spread of the virus. Now there are 64 farms enrolled in the program, according to USDA data. The document was sent on September 30 by the Missouri state veterinarian to other animal health officials in the state and to a USDA official in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which is managing the agency's response to avian flu, according to the emails. The recommendations from the group of bovine practitioners came after they participated in a September meeting of the American Veterinary Medical Association along with representatives from the poultry, livestock, and pork industries, according to the emails.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 06:34 PM\nSource:[Forbes México](https://forbes.com.mx/eu-comenzara-a-realizar-pruebas-de-gripe-aviar-en-leche-a-granel-tras-presion-de-la-industria/)\n\n**USDA to Test Raw Milk Across Country to Detect Avian Influenza**\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) will soon begin testing raw milk across the country to detect avian influenza. This decision comes after pressure from the livestock and veterinary industries, which have pushed the agency to strengthen its current surveillance approach, deemed inadequate to contain the virus, according to state records and industry documents examined by Reuters. USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack stated, 'These situations evolve over time, and as they evolve, we need to recalibrate and adjust.' The agency will start by collecting samples from states where dairy cows have contracted the virus, including specific farms if necessary to track the virus's spread. The USDA will then conduct tests in states that have not identified the virus in dairy cows. The rapid spread of the virus in California, where nearly 200 dairy herds have tested positive since late August, contributed to the USDA's decision to continue surveillance efforts, Vilsack said. The USDA had previously stated that it was possible to eliminate avian influenza from the US dairy herd using its previous approach. However, the agency now wants to eradicate the virus, Vilsack added, citing the success of Colorado's use of milk testing to eliminate new cases of infected dairy cows. In some states, dairy producers have opposed voluntary testing of their animals due to fear of economic repercussions. The American Association of Animal Health has adopted a resolution emphasizing the need for a coordinated national surveillance plan between states and the federal government, according to a copy of the document obtained by Reuters. 'The strict requirement for a pre-test of only lactating dairy cows moving from one state to another is inadequate,' the document reads, recommending that the agency coordinate with the livestock and state sectors in a national surveillance and data collection strategy. 'We can't wait for a virus to die out. This strategy hasn't worked,' said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, who participated in discussions on the new recommendations. The American Association of Bovine Practitioners has also written recommendations on how the USDA could better contain the virus, including conducting weekly tests on tanker trucks, according to emails and a copy of the project obtained from the Missouri Department of Agriculture in response to a public records request. 'The disease continues to spread, and the current voluntary surveillance is inadequate,' wrote the AABP executive director, K. Fred Gingrich II, in a September 28 email to a group server.

This move aims to better assess where H5N1 is present on U.S. dairy farms and inform biosecurity and containment measures. Since the disease was first detected in dairy cattle in March 2024, the USDA and state and federal partners have taken several steps to understand and eliminate the virus. The number of states with known avian influenza detections in dairy herds has dropped from 14 to two, including California and Idaho. USDA believes that additional steps are needed to remain proactively in support of effective biosecurity measures. The agency has precedent with successful bulk milk testing approaches and plans to work with regions and states to expand bulk milk testing. USDA continues to emphasize that biosecurity is the best weapon against the spread of H5N1 and encourages farmers to practice good biosecurity even if the virus has not been detected in their state or vicinity. The agency also supports the rapid development and timely approval of an H5N1 vaccine for dairy cows. USDA has consistently operated on a science-based, step-by-step approach informed by what it learns about this virus through its everyday work, research, and surveillance efforts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 05:11 PM\nSource:[U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/10/30/usda-builds-actions-protect-livestock-and-public-health-h5n1-avian)\n\n**As avian flu cases climb, California agencies and industry move to respond**\nCalifornia is experiencing a fall wave of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) among dairy and poultry operations. As of Tuesday, 186 dairy herds have been infected, the most of any state, according to the USDA. Steve Lyle, director of public affairs for the California Department of Food and Agriculture, said CDFA is testing herds via bulk tank samples, but an exact number of infected cows is not available. Lyle added that the response is evolving as fresh information is confirmed, and one dairy facility has been cleared since the first outbreak. CDFA is 'monitoring closely' to see if infection can jump from cattle back to birds, but there's no current evidence of that happening. Steven Fenaroli, a policy advocate with the California Farm Bureau, praised the government response, saying CDFA and USDA have done a great job in coming up with contingency plans and pulling stakeholders together. However, Western United Dairies CEO Anja Raudabaugh expressed concern for the financial losses facing Central Valley farmers, saying it has been hard on the farmers who are placed under quarantine, and financial relief for those dairies who have had a lot of mortality and milk production losses is not compensable. Despite early October's heat wave, which Raudabaugh said was a setback for cows in recovery, she said the current cool down in temperatures across the state is already making a difference. USDA sent five staff members to support CDFA traceback and epidemiological investigations and nine case managers to complete questionnaires and follow up on contact traces. CDFA confirmed 16 human cases Monday; all the people had contact with infected farm animals and are experiencing only mild symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah said Quest Diagnostics was awarded a CDC contract for an HPAI test that will soon be available with a clinical prescription.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 11:05 AM\nSource:[agri-pulse.com](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/21828-as-avian-flu-cases-climb-california-agencies-and-industry-move-quickly-to-respond)\n\n**From poultry to public health: Understanding the H5N1 threat**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is monitoring the spread of avian influenza (H5N1) in the United States, particularly among poultry and dairy workers. As of October 9, 2024, 18 human cases of H5N1 have been reported in the US since 2022. The CDC has allocated over 100,000 doses of seasonal flu vaccine for farm workers in 12 states with positive H5 cases to mitigate the risk of spread. The agency is also testing existing candidate vaccines for effectiveness against current H5N1 strains. Meghan Davis, DVM, PhD, MPH, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, emphasized the importance of the One Health approach in addressing zoonotic diseases like H5N1. The CDC is working with public health laboratories to monitor influenza virus testing and flu surveillance data using CDC's enhanced nationwide summer surveillance strategy. The agency is also providing safety measures for veterinary professionals and clients, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and biosecurity protocols. According to Kemba Marshall, MPH, DVM, DABVP (Avian), SHRM-CP, founder of Marshall Recruiting Consortium, 'Biosecurity also means we should be able to have a record and a log of every person that came to the fair, animal exhibition, or farm.' The CDC recommends that feline owners who have interacted with animals or birds with unknown health status change their clothes and shoes before interacting with personal pets. The agency is also warning against consuming unpasteurized milk due to the H5N1 bird flu virus found in more than 140 US dairy herds and high levels in raw milk.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 05:49 PM\nSource:[dvm360.com](https://www.dvm360.com/view/comprehending-the-h5n1-threat-to-public-health)\n\n**HPAI in cattle: What’s next?**\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has spread to dairy cattle in the US, posing new challenges. According to Dr. Erica Spackman, HPAI outbreaks are now global and affecting species not traditionally associated with HPAI, such as dairy cows. The virus has caused significant losses in the US poultry industry since 2022 and is still ongoing. Dr. Juan Piñeiro noted that the outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in dairy cattle started in the Texas panhandle in February 2023 and has now spread to 14 states, affecting over 319 dairy herds. The disease was initially misdiagnosed but later confirmed as HPAI H5N1 clade B3.13. Precision dairy technologies like wearable collars alerted producers that something was wrong. The FDA and USDA provided evidence that commercial milk supplies remain safe due to pasteurization and separation of sick cows from the milk supply. Dr. Piñeiro emphasized the importance of improving timely communication and collaborative efforts from different agencies to stop the spread of this or other emerging diseases. Dr. Kay Russo highlighted the need for development of vaccines for dairy cattle to address HPAI. Dr. Michelle Kromm noted that HPAI virus clade B3.13 presents unique challenges for all animal agriculture, including the need for a consistent national strategy, better science generation, and the exploration of vaccine programs to break transmission cycles.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[thepigsite.com](https://www.thepigsite.com/articles/hpai-in-cattle-whats-next)\n\n**USDA Relaxes Avian Flu Testing Order for Dairy Cows Amid Industry Pressure**\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has relaxed its emergency order on testing for avian flu in dairy cows, following pressure from state and industry representatives. The order, published in April after cases of avian flu were detected in eight states, required dairy cows moving between states to have a negative test result within seven days of travel. The USDA had initially considered stricter requirements, including a three-day testing window, but responded to industry concerns before publishing the order. Two veterinarians and a dairy industry representative told Reuters that the relaxation of the order may have contributed to the spread of the virus. They cited logistical constraints in testing animals within a shorter timeframe. Since the order was issued, the outbreak has spread to over 330 herds in 14 states and to 17 human cases among dairy workers. 'All changes or clarifications to the federal order have been made to protect animal and public health by following best scientific practices, using the best available data, and ensuring an appropriate balance between compliance and feasibility for producers,' said a USDA spokesperson in an email. The agency has conducted over 16,000 tests before movement and is supporting an investigation in California to determine if inappropriate animal movements introduced the virus into the state. Rosemary Sifford, USDA chief veterinarian, met with the Livestock Marketing Association to discuss the proposed federal order on April 24, according to a memo sent by the industry group to USDA officials and obtained through a public records request. 'The 72-hour window before movement is simply not achievable,' wrote Chelsea Good, LMA vice president of government and industry affairs, suggesting instead a testing window of 7-14 days. The USDA did not set a testing deadline in the initial order or in supplementary information published on April 25. A guidance document published on April 26 gave dairy plants a seven-day window for testing. In an ideal world, tests should be conducted within 24 hours, said Keith Poulsen, veterinarian and director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. The rural nature of dairy farms makes it difficult to transport samples to a laboratory, he added. During the same week in April, state animal health officials told the USDA that it should allow states to agree on alternative documentation instead of a veterinarian's health certificate for non-lactating dairy cows crossing state borders to go to slaughter. Non-lactating dairy cows are often converted to ground beef. In the April 26 guidance document, the USDA stated that states would be able to accept alternative documents, which may include basic information such as owner and shipper addresses. According to Bob Seiler, president of the Central Equity Milk Cooperative in Kansas, requiring veterinary documents is too costly for dairy plants with thin margins. He said he was not asked to provide alternative documents when sending non-lactating cows to slaughter. According to Gail Hansen, former Kansas state veterinarian, avoiding the requirement for a veterinarian's approval may have contributed to the spread of the virus. 'The risk of something slipping through the cracks is much greater,' she said. A shortage of rural veterinarians may prevent farmers from having their herds inspected before each shipment, said Poulsen. The USDA spokesperson said that non-slaughter cows are considered to pose a lower risk of avian flu transmission and that other documents allow for traceability in case of infection. California is investigating how the virus entered the state, including whether imports of cows met legal requirements. Since the end of August, over 130 herds and 13 dairy workers have been infected in the state, where dairy production is the largest. Even before the federal order, the agricultural sector relied on state officials to push back against calls to restrict animal movement, according to documents obtained by Reuters. In an email dated March 26, Kansas Farm Bureau CEO Terry Holdren asked Kansas Secretary of Agriculture Mike Beam and Justin Smith, the state's animal health official, if they could pressure Nebraska to continue accepting cattle, after hearing that Nebraska might refuse cattle. On April 1, Nebraska began requiring a permit for lactating dairy cows coming from other states. In some cases, farmers have avoided submitting their cows for testing. 'Dairy producers have no interest in declaring and testing their cows,' said Rick Naerebout, executive director of the Idaho Dairymen's Association.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 11:20 AM\nSource:[zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/indice/S-P-GSCI-CLASS-III-MILK-U-65338632/actualite/Exclusif-Les-reactions-des-Etats-et-de-l-industrie-ont-conduit-le-ministere-americain-de-l-agr-48138936/)\n\n**Inside the Bungled Bird Flu Response, Where Profits Collide With Public Health**\nThe US federal government's response to the growing H5N1 bird flu outbreak in dairy cows has been criticized for prioritizing profits over public health.

As one White House health official notes, 'Not only have we not learned, we have regressed.' Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, warns that the country is repeating the mistakes of the last pandemic due to a lack of nationwide surveillance and a clear understanding of the outbreak's scope.

The outbreak occurred at a farm in Clinton County, near Lansing, and testing at the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory initially identified the virus. If confirmed as H5N1, the detection would push the number of US outbreaks in dairy cattle to 306 from 14 states. Additionally, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has confirmed three more H5N1 detections in bottlenose dolphins, which were sampled last December and January. According to the USDA, the clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus is known to infect sea mammals, including seals and sea lions, among several other mammal species.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 08:43 PM\nSource:[CIDRAP](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/michigan-reports-avian-flu-another-dairy-herd)\n\n**It starts with a plan**\nThe recent outbreaks of avian influenza virus Type A (H5N1) in dairy herds have highlighted the importance of biosecurity measures for livestock producers. According to Linda Tikofsky, senior associate director of cattle professional services at Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, 'Avian influenza came from waterfowl, and the National Veterinary Laboratory established that it was one incident, a crossover, that brought the disease into the Texas Panhandle.' However, subsequent outbreaks have been caused by cattle moving between premises, and peridomestic birds such as starlings and pigeons may also act as a transmission source. Tikofsky emphasizes the need for a biosecurity plan, which should include sanitizing trailers between loads, monitoring interactions with people who may have moved from farm to farm, and implementing hygiene practices. She also stresses the importance of working with a veterinarian to develop a plan, which should evaluate how animals are transported, who visits the farm, and how visitors are handled. Tikofsky notes that while there are no vaccines currently available for avian influenza, a robust vaccine program can help stop a disease if it gets introduced. She also recommends including disaster preparedness in the biosecurity plan, such as having a dedicated space separate from the home herd for animals that need to be moved during a disaster.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 07:21 PM\nSource:[agriculture.com](https://www.agriculture.com/it-starts-with-a-plan-8729238)\n\n**US Avian Influenza Outbreak: A Growing Concern for Human Transmission**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States confirmed a new human case of avian influenza A(H5) on September 6, 2024, in Missouri. The patient, who was hospitalized, had underlying medical conditions, was treated with antiviral medications for influenza, and was later discharged and recovered. This case is unique as it is the first without known exposure to infected animals. Unlike previous human cases, which were linked to animal exposure, this case did not have any immediate exposure to animals. The CDC continues to monitor the situation closely, stating that there is no evidence of ongoing transmission among close contacts or otherwise. The risk to the general public from the H5N1 virus remains low, according to the CDC. The USDA reported the first detection of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in dairy cattle and unpasteurized milk samples from Texas and Kansas on March 25. Since then, 255 dairy farms have been affected, along with over 100 million poultry and around 10,000 wild birds. Raúl Rivas González, a microbiology professor, wrote that the current outbreak has raised concerns about the increased risk of sustained transmission among humans. González stated that the analysis of data from the sequences of infected cow viruses suggests a single event of transmission from an infected bird to a single dairy cow. The event is estimated to have occurred at the end of 2023 or early 2024. 'The data suggests that H5N1 has adapted perfectly to a new host: cows. And the high presence of the virus in the mammary glands and milk of these animals suggests that the contamination of the milking machines may have played an important role in the transmission of the pathogen', González wrote. However, it is still unclear how the virus is transmitted between cows. González concluded that 'we are facing the worst global crisis in the history of H5N1 avian influenza and there is growing uncertainty about the impact it can have on humans. It is essential to elevate surveillance, efficiently and agilely communicate new cases, increase transparency, and reinforce prevention and control measures.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 05:24 PM\nSource:[El Espectador](https://www.elespectador.com/salud/despues-de-seis-meses-que-ha-pasado-con-el-brote-de-gripe-aviar-en-estados-unidos/)\n\n**Global Alert Issued as Avian Flu Virus Spreads Through Cow Milking**\nA global alert has been issued due to the spread of the avian flu virus, H5N1, which has been identified as a new transmission route through cow milking. Since its discovery in a Chinese goose farm in 1996, the virus has evolved, affecting over 485 bird species and 48 mammal species worldwide. Between 2003 and November 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) documented 880 human cases of avian flu, resulting in 460 deaths in 23 countries. The current outbreak, starting in 2024, has affected farms in the United States, and a new study published in Nature has identified cow milking as a new transmission route in US livestock farms. The study found that H5N1 has infected cows in 231 farms across 14 US states, prompting alarms in Europe. Although it was thought that the virus mainly affected birds, this finding has highlighted the possibility that cattle can also be a source of transmission. Additionally, four workers from these farms have contracted the virus, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported the first human case of avian flu without direct contact with infected animals. The virus could be transmitted through milk supplies, as a team from the Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Medicine at the College of Veterinarians of Kansas has identified that the mammary glands of dairy cows are the primary focus of infection. In June 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) observed signs of the virus in 20% of milk supplies. This finding raises the possibility that Europe, where milking procedures are not significantly different, may also face a similar risk. Virologist Thomas Peacock warns that 'containment strategies are not working.' In an article published in Nature, Peacock asserts that we are at a 'turning point,' as the H5N1 virus could become permanent in both the Americas and Europe. The virus has also been detected in European fur farms, increasing concern about its spread to other species and industrial sectors. Financial support has been requested to implement new detection technologies, and the European Commission has signed a contract for the purchase of 665,000 doses of the H5N1 vaccine, with the option to acquire up to 40 million additional doses.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 30, 2024 10:00 AM\nSource:[Antena 3](https://www.antena3.com/noticias/salud/alerta-global-propagacion-virus-gripe-aviar-nuevas-vias-transmision-vacas-posible-crisis-europa_2024093066fa76b13c87870001f167fb.html)\n\n**World Dairy Expo says it's staying non-partisan by denying Trump campaign stop**\nThe World Dairy Expo in Madison has declined a request from former President Donald Trump's campaign to make a stop at the event. According to Lisa Behnke, communications manager for World Dairy Expo, the decision was made due to logistical reasons and a desire to keep the event apolitical. Behnke stated, 'We host an event for cows and people who care for cows and not for candidates. We're staying in our lane.' The expo, which attracts over 50,000 attendees from across North America and visitors from overseas, is focused on showcasing dairy cattle and providing a platform for the industry to share information with candidates and elected officials. Despite the decline, Behnke expressed gratitude for the opportunity to host the event and emphasized the importance of taking precautions against Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1), also known as bird flu, which has been detected in dairy herds in 14 states. The expo is taking special precautions to ensure the safety of the valuable purebred cattle that come to Madison, including working with veterinary experts from USDA and the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2024 04:11 PM\nSource:[The Post-Crescent](https://eu.postcrescent.com/story/news/2024/09/27/world-dairy-expo-officials-decline-trumps-campaign-visit-to-madison/75401088007)\n\n**34 Dairy Farms In California Affected By Bird Flu Outbreaks**\nThe California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) has reported that 34 dairy farms in the Central Valley have confirmed cases of the highly pathogenic H5-N1 avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu. Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, stated that farmers are 'deeply concerned' about the situation and feel that it is not yet fully under control. The dairy industry is hopeful for the development of a vaccine specifically for cows that would also meet trade regulations. Although the risk to humans remains low, experts have expressed concerns that the prolonged presence of the virus on dairy farms could potentially allow it to combine with human viruses, increasing the potential threat to public health. California leads the nation in milk production, with 1.7 million dairy cows generating 3.37 billion pounds of milk in August, accounting for nearly 19% of the national output for that month, as reported by the USDA.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 09:48 PM\nSource:[FinanzNachrichten.de](https://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2024-09/63360565-34-dairy-farms-in-california-affected-by-bird-flu-outbreaks-020.htm)\n\n**CDC Continues to Respond to Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Outbreak**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to respond to the public health challenge posed by the outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) in multiple states in the United States. Since April 2024, 14 human cases of infection with the avian influenza A(H5) virus have been reported in the US. Four of these cases were associated with exposure to infected dairy cows, and nine with exposure to infected poultry. The risk of contracting avian influenza H5 for the general public remains low. The USDA reports that 213 dairy herds in 14 US states have confirmed cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infections in dairy cows. The CDC is working with the USDA, FDA, ASPR, state and local health officials, and other partners to monitor the situation and prevent the spread of the virus. The CDC is also conducting serosurveys to assess past exposure to H5 viruses among veterinarians and other veterinary professionals. The CDC is posting a new webpage describing influenza surveillance activities for the 2024-2025 flu season, which include monitoring of wastewater for influenza A virus and avian influenza A(H5) in the US. The CDC recommends that people avoid contact with sick or dead animals, including wild and domestic birds, and avoid exposure to animal waste, unpasteurized milk, and materials that have been in contact with infected animals. The CDC also recommends that people who have contact with animals during their work should know the risk of exposure to avian influenza viruses and take the necessary precautions. 'It is essential to reduce the risk of people and contain the risk for public health in general,' said the CDC. \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 10:07 PM\nSource:[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://espanol.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-09202024.html)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The current trajectory has surpassed expectations, especially after the US elections in November, but caution arises around possible reversal volatility near 100k. Market trends are closely tied to expectations for Trump's policy agenda, with momentum likely to recharge through the Christmas holidays and into early 2025. Technical analysis suggests that a decisive close below 66,000 could pull the trend further toward the lower boundary of the upper channel near the 50,000-mark. Additionally, significant volatility may occur around the 100k mark, given its psychological impact and potential for profit-taking.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 08:34 AM\nSource:[forex.com](https://www.forex.com/ie/news-and-analysis/bitcoin-forecast-is-the-rally-losing-its-steam/)\n\n**Bitcoin's Price Continues to Rise: Could it Reach $100,000 by the End of the Year?**\nBitcoin's price continues to rise, and analysts believe it could reach its maximum value of $100,000 before the end of the year. According to Ryan Lee, chief analyst of Bitget Research, 'if history repeats itself and Bitcoin's prices grow as projected, a 14.7% increase from the current price will take the currency far above $100,000 by the end of the month. The post-halving cycle trend is also very positive when projecting the future of Bitcoin.' Lee also notes that Bitcoin has already surpassed the $90,000 record, a week after Donald Trump's election win in the US. The cryptocurrency has risen over 20% in November, which historically averages monthly returns of over 44%, according to CoinGlass data. Other analysts, such as those from Bitfinex, also predict a positive trajectory for Bitcoin's price, with some even expecting it to reach $100,000 in the coming months. 'Predicting the price is a difficult bet, but we expect Bitcoin to have a limited decline now given the bullish momentum, as well as the fact that we avoided a recession, which at the time seemed highly plausible,' said the Bitfinex analysts. 'We expect Bitcoin to stay within a range and accumulate a bit, and in our opinion, a $100,000 target in a few months doesn't seem too far-fetched.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 04:01 PM\nSource:[lagaceta.com.ar](https://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/1059808/economia/bitcoin-no-para-subir-cuando-llegaria-al-valor-maximo-us100000.html)\n\n**Bitcoin Breaks Through $93,000, Reaches New Historical High**\nBitcoin broke through the $93,000 mark, reaching a new historical high of $93,265 on November 13, 2024, according to TradingView. The cryptocurrency's market capitalization exceeded $1.84 trillion, pushing it to seventh place in the global ranking. The daily trading volume exceeded $716 million. As of the time of writing, the price of bitcoin has retreated below $90,000. The cryptocurrency's market capitalization and dominance have increased, with the former reaching $1.84 trillion and the latter reaching 61.38%. As a result, bitcoin temporarily surpassed Saudi Aramco in the global ranking. However, the cryptocurrency's market capitalization has since fallen to $1.77 trillion, pushing it back to eighth place. The author notes that the increase in market capitalization and dominance is a positive trend, but also mentions that the cryptocurrency's price has retreated.

The upcoming CPI data for November will be crucial in determining the direction of Bitcoin (BTC) in the near future, especially considering the potential changes to interest rate cuts. Analysts had expected a 2.6% annual inflation rate, up from 2.4% in September, and a stable core CPI of 3.3%. However, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has been cautious, opting for a gradual decrease in interest rates. Jerome Powell's goal of a 2% inflation rate is still in question. For the Fed to consider cutting interest rates in December, the results must be in line with expectations, confirming a continuous disinflationary trend.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 01:36 PM\nSource:[thecryptogateway.it](https://thecryptogateway.it/inflazione-usa-bitcoin-alla-prova-dei-dati-cpi-di-novembre/)\n\n**Altcoin Season: When Will It Begin?**\nThe cryptocurrency market has seen a 28.24% growth since November 5, with nearly all top cryptocurrencies showing positive momentum and Bitcoin increasing by 29.08%. Popular analyst Miles Deutscher believes that the current Bitcoin cycle is similar to previous ones and that it is currently in its third phase. According to Deutscher, the current cycle is likely to follow the same pattern as previous ones, with the market reaching its peak in the second or third quarter of 2025. Deutscher also notes that the current Bitcoin dominance is stable and that the altcoin rally is likely to occur before the decline of Bitcoin dominance. However, Deutscher also points out that the speculation index, which was over 90% in previous cycles, is currently at 21%, indicating a more cautious market. Overall, Deutscher believes that the Bitcoin market cycle will reach its peak in the middle of next year, providing a strong environment for altcoin growth. 'The current Bitcoin cycle is similar to previous ones,' Deutscher said. 'It's currently in its third phase, which usually starts at least 200 days after the halving.' Deutscher also noted that the current market is 'more cautious' than previous ones, with the speculation index at 21% compared to over 90% in previous cycles. 'The current market is more cautious, but it's still a good environment for altcoin growth,' Deutscher said. 'The altcoin rally is likely to occur before the decline of Bitcoin dominance,' Deutscher added.

Some analysts believe that the change with large increases in altcoins could mean that altcoins will perform better than Bitcoin. ETH, XRP, and DOGE have seen huge increases after a significant breakout. ETH has just surpassed the important resistance level of $3,000 and if the momentum continues, higher levels can be seen. XRP has also joined this rally and is making strong upward movements with room to grow. The question now is whether XRP can surpass the next resistance level of $0.60. Dogecoin is also on the rise, with the price surpassing the resistance level of $0.18 and showing the ability to continue the bullish trend. The altcoin rally is supported by several indicators. Benjamin Cowen, a well-known analyst, stated that the dominant level of 60% for Bitcoin often serves as a benchmark for the strength of altcoins. Historically, the attention of investors has shifted to altcoins in search of higher returns when Bitcoin's dominance reaches this level. Cowen also highlights trends from the past, speculating that altcoins may rise in November before falling in December, similar to the trends in 2020. The ETH/BTC pair will be crucial to monitor as the altcoin rally continues. However, macroeconomic factors and regulatory forces still have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market, and a change in monetary policy can cause significant volatility. To determine if the altcoin rally can continue, investors should closely monitor ETH, XRP, and DOGE, as well as Bitcoin's dominance patterns.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: November 10, 2024 11:30 AM\nSource:[bitcoinmagazine.nl](https://bitcoinmagazine.nl/nieuws/eth-xrp-en-doge-herstellen-zich-altcoin-seizoen-op-komst)\n\n**'Alt Season' Begins With Massive ETH, DOGE and XRP Pumps**\nThe 'alt season' rally may have begun, with Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP showing recovery signals.

Ethereum has broken through the $3,000 mark and is aiming for higher levels, while Dogecoin has climbed past $0.18 and XRP is making a strong upward move. Cowen notes that a 60% Bitcoin dominance level frequently precedes a shift in investor attention to altcoins, which may rise through November before declining in December, similar to past trends.

Cardano and Dogecoin saw the largest gains among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by capitalization, with increases of 32.1% and 10.4%, respectively. The surge in cryptocurrency prices and investor optimism follows Donald Trump's election as US President, who has expressed support for digital assets. While Bitcoin has not yet reached its 2021 peak value, when one coin was equivalent to 37 ounces of gold, it is now worth 28.43 ounces.

Cowen, who made a brief market analysis via X, pointed to December 2024 and January 2025. Cowen, who warned about the significant increase in Bitcoin's dominance and its potential to lower altcoins, especially in the BTC pair, said: 'We are now ready for the big finale in altcoins. The expected deadline has arrived. I expect the declines to end by December 2024 or at the latest by the second week of January 2025. It was a long journey. Many people gave up, but I always said this would happen.' Cowen has been warning about the risks of altcoin investments for approximately two years, and has regularly mentioned it in his publications. He pointed out that the dominance warning he made has come true, and that Bitcoin's power has been proven once again with the recent increase in dominance. The dominance of Bitcoin has increased by over 39% in the last three years, reaching over 60%. Every movement in Bitcoin has particularly affected altcoins this year, and the most followed ETH/BTC pair has fallen to as low as 0.04. Cowen had also predicted a short-term recovery in this pair.

Despite altcoins losing value on their BTC pairs, Bitcoin's price surge has allowed it to surpass smaller coins. According to chart analysis, Bitcoin's recent decline from the $70,000 mark illustrates selling pressure at higher levels, but does not necessarily indicate a breakdown in the cryptocurrency's bullish trend. Key support levels to watch are $67,000, $64,000, and $62,000. To maintain its momentum and advance higher, Bitcoin must recover and hold above $70,000.

This has happened despite a major price reversal, with Bitcoin's recent surge allowing it to surpass numerous smaller coins in performance. According to chart analysis, the price of Bitcoin recently reversed from the $70,000 mark, failing to hold onto its position above this crucial level. However, this decline does not necessarily portend a breakdown of the cryptocurrency's overall bullish trend. The $67,000, $64,000 and $62,000 key support levels are worth keeping an eye on, as they might act as stabilizing points for Bitcoin if it continues to retract. In order to maintain its bullish momentum and possibly advance higher, Bitcoin must recover and hold above $70,000. As a result, altcoins are likely to continue to struggle on their BTC pairs as long as Bitcoin is strong, making riskier altcoin wagers less alluring.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2024 09:39 AM\nSource:[u.today](https://u.today/bitcoin-btc-dominance-hits-60-despite-major-price-reversal)\n\n**Bitcoin Likely to Enter New Bull Market If This Happens: CryptoQuant**\nAccording to CryptoQuant's analysis, Bitcoin (BTC) may not be entering a new bull market yet, despite recent gains. The reason is that Bitcoin's dominance is increasing, not decreasing, which is a sign that investors are not diversifying their funds into alternative coins (altcoins). Historically, major bull runs have coincided with declines in Bitcoin dominance. Woominkyu, the author of CryptoQuant Quicktake, said, 'Looking at this chart, we can see that, historically, major bull runs across the market have coincided with declines in Bitcoin dominance. If this pattern repeats, we might anticipate the beginning of a new crypto bull market as Bitcoin dominance decreases.' However, Bitcoin's dominance has been increasing, reaching 58.2% as of November 1, up from 54.7% on October 24. The launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has driven a huge capital inflow into the Bitcoin network, making it less likely for Bitcoin's dominance to decrease in the near future.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2024 08:00 PM\nSource:[CryptoPotato](https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-likely-to-enter-new-bull-market-if-this-happens-cryptoquant//)\n\n**Will Bitcoin Dominance Prevent a Stronger Altcoin Market?**\nThe Bitcoin dominance is currently at 60%, with only 40% of the 2.42 billion dollar crypto market invested in altcoins. This could be the reason why altcoins like Ethereum and Solana are not seeing the same level of growth as Bitcoin. However, according to crypto analyst Evca Wolf, this will change once Bitcoin reaches a new all-time high and enters a consolidation phase. Many investors will then liquidate their Bitcoin holdings and move to altcoins, which will receive increased attention and investment. Wolf advises investors to be patient and wait for the altcoin market to react to the Bitcoin surge. Additionally, the upcoming US presidential election on November 5th could have a significant impact on the crypto market, with Donald Trump being more favorable to Web3 technologies and cryptocurrencies.

Bitget Research notes that several factors support BTC's potential growth, including the expected Fed rate cut on 7 November and the Microsoft board's vote on the Bitcoin investment scheduled for 10 December.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 09:48 AM\nSource:[FXEmpire.com](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/bitcoins-rush-to-the-top-1472472)\n\n**Bitcoin Breaks Through $71,000 Level**\nOn October 29, 2024, Bitcoin broke through the $71,000 level and stabilized at it. Other cryptocurrencies also showed a positive trend. An expert explained this by positive expectations of a potential decrease in the Federal Reserve's interest rate in early November. According to TradingView, the daily increase in Bitcoin's price is almost 2%. At the time of writing, the price is $71,251. The Bitcoin dominance indicator also increased, reaching 59.79%. Other major cryptocurrencies by market capitalization also showed significant growth, with Dogecoin's price increasing by over 15%: 'The rise in Bitcoin is supported by several factors, including the expected decrease in the Federal Reserve's interest rate on November 7, 2024. The market expects the regulator to lower the rate by 25 basis points, which reflects the need for adjustments to support economic growth,' said Ryan Lee, an analyst at Bitget Research in an interview with The Block.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 08:20 AM\nSource:[incrypted.com](https://incrypted.com/bytkoyn-probyl-uroven-v-71-000/)\n\n**Bitcoin's Dominance Approaches 60%: Will November's Events Push Price Beyond $100,000?**\nThe dominance of Bitcoin is approaching 60%, but will the upcoming events in November, such as interest rate cuts and elections, push the price of Bitcoin beyond $100,000, or will unexpected factors derail its upward trajectory? The article explores the possibility of a breakout above $100,000, but no specific information or quotes are provided to support this claim.

According to Derive, a DeFi derivatives platform, there is a high concentration of bets around an $80,000 Bitcoin strike price and a strong presence of short-term call sales. Derive founder Nick Forster said, 'The overwhelming dominance of calls being sold suggests a strategic premium collection by traders, while the focus around the $80,000 strike highlights a potential pivotal point for Bitcoin.' Forster also mentioned that traders are paying more for options, signaling protective moves, or 'hedging,' as the election approaches. This added cost, known as the volatility risk premium, shows traders anticipate larger price shifts and are willing to pay to manage their risk. Forster added, 'There's a one in three chance that BTC could see a swing greater than 10% on election day, with a more volatile scenario of 20% movement sitting at a 5% likelihood.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 03:01 AM\nSource:[Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/288744/us-election-fuels-bitcoin-volatility-options-traders-eye-80000-target)\n\n**BTC dominance nears 60% — Will November’s rate cuts and election push Bitcoin past $100K?**\nBitcoin's market dominance is nearing 60%, a level last reached in April 2021. This surge in dominance, combined with upcoming events such as the US presidential election and the Federal Reserve's policy review, may lay the groundwork for Bitcoin's next major move. The US presidential election on November 5 could be monumental for crypto, with Republican Donald Trump leading with a 66.1% chance of winning. The Federal Reserve's potential 25 basis point rate cut on November 7 could inject fresh liquidity into the market, potentially boosting Bitcoin's upward momentum. Additionally, Russia is set to lift its ban on Bitcoin mining on November 1, reflecting a broader trend of governments easing crypto restrictions. Experts predict that Bitcoin could reach new all-time highs if this momentum persists through November, with some analysts forecasting a potential price of $90,000 to $100,000 by the end of the year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 05:02 PM\nSource:[crypto.news](https://crypto.news/will-novembers-rate-cuts-election-push-btc-past-100k/)\n\n**Altseason 2025 Under Threat? Why 60% Bitcoin Dominance is Not a Good Sign**\nThe price of Bitcoin has surpassed $68,000, sparking talk of the upcoming altseason. However, analysts at Hashkey Capital believe that for a new altseason to begin, Bitcoin's market dominance must reach 62-70%. According to their optimistic scenario, an altseason is more likely if the price of Bitcoin exceeds $80,000. Additionally, the ratio of Bitcoin to gold must increase above its current level of 23, and altcoin premiums must return. Cryptoanalyst Willy Woo believes that approaching a 60% market dominance by Bitcoin may signal the weakening of altseasons. He predicts that future cycles will see reduced returns from altcoins, changing the approach of traders. Woo notes that altcoins with lower capitalization will be 'pumped' after Bitcoin's price surge to $68,000, as investors seek higher returns on riskier assets. He also believes that the current 3rd altseason is focused on meme coins, which he calls 'a joke in the crypto space.' According to PlanB's preliminary forecast, if Bitcoin reaches $70,000 in October and Donald Trump wins the presidential election in November, it could be a turning point.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 11:00 AM\nSource:[itc.ua](https://itc.ua/news/altsezon-2025-pod-ugrozoj-pochemu-60-domynyrovanyya-bytkoyna-eto-ne-ochen-horosho/)\n\n**Altcoin Season Unlikely in November as Bitcoin Prepares for New ATH**\nThe likelihood of an altcoin season in November remains low as Bitcoin's dominance grows, with its price rising from $53,000 to $67,000 since mid-September. According to QCP, 'Bitcoin dominance continues to rise, reaching highs of 59.75% for the week...We believe that the uptrend in bitcoin dominance is likely to persist in the near term as bitcoin approaches its ATH levels.' If Bitcoin reaches its all-time high of $73,078, its market dominance could surge to 60%, potentially delaying the altcoin season. Currently, only seven altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over a 90-day period, suggesting that altcoins lack the momentum needed for a breakout.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2024 08:37 PM\nSource:[BeInCrypto](https://beincrypto.com/altcoin-season-unlikely-in-november/)\n\n**Bitcoin Dominance Likely to Persist in Near Term: QCP Capital**\nQCP Capital reports that Bitcoin's dominance in the cryptocurrency market has increased to 59.75% for the week, with a current share of 59.30%. This rise in dominance suggests Bitcoin's growing strength in the market. In contrast, ETHBTC broke its key support level and declined by 5.85%. QCP predicts that Bitcoin's dominance will continue to rise as it approaches its all-time high levels. Despite fluctuations in the market, Bitcoin attempted to break through the local high of $69,500 but failed to move further up. Institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, with BTC ETF net inflows of $997.7 million this week. Other market incidents include the US government probing into Tether, which led to a decline in USDT before it rose again. Geopolitical factors, such as Israel's retaliatory attacks on Iran, also affected the markets, causing selling pressure. The week's focus turns to the non-farm payroll figures, which will give insight into the Federal Reserve's future actions. Market expectations remain stable, with a 95.1% probability of a 25bp rate cut in November.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2024 08:56 AM\nSource:[fxdailyreport.com](https://fxdailyreport.com/bitcoin-dominance-likely-to-persist-in-near-term-qcp-capital/)\n\n**Bitcoin Maintains Bullish Trend and Strengthens Dominance Over the Market**\nThe bitcoin (BTC) continues to rise, reaching above $67,000 after a 0.5% increase in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has surpassed $68,000 in the last session and its weekly appreciation is around 10%. Ethereum (ETH) also maintains its value above $2,600 after a slight increase in the last day. The panorama is mixed for 'altcoins', with some tokens like Solana (SOL), Toncoin, and Cardano (ADA) losing value moderately, while others like XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Tron (TRX), Avalanche (AVAX), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are experiencing moderate gains. According to TradingView, the bitcoin's dominance, or its weight or capitalization relative to the rest of the market, has reached 59%, the highest level in the current bull cycle and the strongest reading since April 2021. This metric has been falling gradually since it surpassed 70% at the end of 2020 and hit bottom after the FTX collapse in November 2022. Since then, it has been rising steadily. The decline of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is behind much of the growing dominance of bitcoin. The ether/bitcoin ratio is around 0.0385, its weakest level since April 2021. Additionally, ether has only surpassed bitcoin in seven of the last 23 months, with May 2024 being the last month in which the second-largest cryptocurrency outperformed the bitcoin. These movements seem to indicate a clear preference for BTC in a time of uncertainty in the stock market, conditioned by the upcoming US elections on November 5 or the conflict in the Middle East, among other factors. According to experts, the rise of bitcoin in recent days corresponds to traditional movements of the cryptocurrency at this time of year. October is traditionally the most bullish month for the king cryptocurrency, but the increases usually come in the second half of the month, as explained by CryptoQuant analysts. According to these experts, the second week is usually a consolidation period and creates the basis for revaluations of up to more than 10% in the following weeks, as seems to be the case. 'It is necessary for the apparent demand to expand for the bitcoin prices to rise sustainably to a new historical maximum. In these cases, the apparent demand reached a maximum of 490,000-550,000 BTC,' explains Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant analyst. Manuel Villegas, Julius Baer analyst, highlights that the strong demand, as well as the high level of open interest in futures markets, is another factor that is reinforcing the bullish case for bitcoin. 'Regarding the supply, the most relevant factor to consider is the FTX case, where creditors are expected to receive a cash distribution and potentially reassign to cryptocurrencies, which could counteract the pending impact of Mt. Gox. We are waiting for the US elections and the next Fed meeting in less than a month, and in the meantime, volatility should remain high, in line with risk assets,' explains this expert. In this sense, the market seems to be leaning towards two more 25 basis point interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. It is worth noting that this Thursday, the European Central Bank (ECB) will decide whether to reduce or not the official interest rates, with the consensus betting on another new cut.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 17, 2024 07:55 AM\nSource:[bolsamania.com](https://www.bolsamania.com/noticias/criptodivisas/bitcoin-impulso-alcista-refuerza-dominio-mercado--17714974.html)\n\n**Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Trade Like 'No Bear Market On The Horizon,' Trader Predicts All-Time High In The 'Next 3-4 Weeks'**\nCryptocurrency markets are trading higher, with 96% of Bitcoin holders in profit. Notable statistics include a 43.5% increase in large transaction volume and a 10.4% increase in daily active addresses. Analysts predict Bitcoin could reach 60% dominance before an altcoin season begins. Trader Michaël van de Poppe stated that Bitcoin is targeting a new all-time high, potentially reaching $90,000 by the end of the year. CryptoCon marks Bitcoin's next target at $109,000, which could be reached as early as December. According to BitQuant, Bitcoin might consolidate between $75,000 and $95,000, with $63,000 remaining a solid buying price. However, the trader does not recommend buying above $70,000.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 07:59 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/10/41367220/bitcoin-ethereum-dogecoin-trade-like-no-bear-market-on-the-horizon-trader-predicts-all-tim)\n\n**Bitcoin's Dominance Over Ethereum: A Turning Point?**\nAccording to crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, Bitcoin is not ready to give up its leading position, with its dominance in the market expected to rise to 60% from its current 57.64%. This means that Bitcoin is attracting more investors, while altcoins, including Ethereum, are losing ground. Cowen predicts that Ethereum's price will continue to fall relative to Bitcoin, with the ETH/BTC ratio potentially reaching a cycle low. However, he also suggests that Ethereum could stabilize and potentially rebound before other altcoins hit rock bottom. Cowen warns that the worst-case scenario is a temporary rebound followed by a new low in December. Currently, the ETH/BTC ratio is trading around 0.04125 BTC, or approximately $2,597. Investors are advised to remain cautious and closely monitor market developments.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 05:00 AM\nSource:[Cointribune](https://www.cointribune.com/bitcoin-sans-rival-ethereum-seffondre)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."
