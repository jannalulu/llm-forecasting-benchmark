**Savencia Cheese recalls Brie cheeses sold at Aldi, Market Basket after listeria concerns**
Savencia Cheese USA has voluntarily recalled six types of Brie cheese due to potential listeria concerns. The recall affects products with a 'best by' date of December 24, 2024, and was initiated after listeria monocytogenes was identified in the processing equipment at the manufacturing plant.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has listed about 200 cafeterias across the country that could be affected by a massive recall of nearly 12 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and chicken products. Two Chicago area family centers, Fox Valley Family YMCA in Plano and Kiddie Scholars in Matteson, received shipments of the potentially contaminated meat products. BrucePac of Woodburn, Oregon, recalled the roughly 5,000 tons of ready-to-eat foods after U.S. Agriculture Department officials detected listeria in samples of poultry during routine testing.

**BrucePac Recalls 10 Million Pounds of Ready-to-Eat Food Products Due to Listeria Risk**
BrucePac, a manufacturer of pre-cooked meat and poultry, has recalled nearly 10 million pounds of ready-to-eat food products due to a Listeria risk. The products were sold at major retailers such as Trader Joe's, Wegmans, 7-Eleven, Kroger, and others. The recall affects mainly pre-made salads, burritos, and wraps with chicken. According to the US Department of Agriculture, the contamination was caused by pre-cooked chicken from the Oklahoma-based company. BrucePac has since provided further information and updates on specific affected products. The list of recalled items consists mainly of pre-made salads, burritos, and wraps with chicken, sometimes combined with other meat types such as bacon or ham. The products were produced from June 19 to October 8. Most of the products have expired, but some frozen meals from brands like Jenny Craig and Michelina's are still good until 2025 or 2026. Additional retailers that may have sold potentially contaminated products include Walmart, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Amazon, Target, and Aldi, as well as some gas stations and corner stores. No illnesses or deaths have been reported in connection with BrucePac meat. The US Department of Agriculture advises consumers to discard or return any recalled products they may have, and not to sell any remaining products that may be affected. BrucePac did not indicate whether consumers would be eligible for refunds or discounts. The company did not respond to a request for comment. On its website, BrucePac wrote: 'We are committed to providing safe and high-quality products. We work closely with the USDA to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to ensure a safe food supply. We will resume production only when we are certain that the problem has been resolved.'

**USDA Recalls Nearly 10 Million Pounds of Ready-To-Eat Meat**
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has announced a nationwide recall of nearly 10 million pounds (9,986,245 pounds) of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products due to concern that they may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes. The products, produced between June 19, 2024, and October 8, 2024, were shipped to companies and distributors across the country and further distributed to retailers, restaurants, institutions, and establishments. Consumers are urged to check the labels of ready-to-eat meat or poultry products they may have in their possession or see on store shelves for the establishment numbers '51205 or P-51205' within or beneath the USDA mark of inspection. The USDA is advising all restaurants, institutions, stores, and establishments not to serve, use, or sell the recalled products, and to throw them away or return them to wherever they were purchased. Consumers should also throw away or return any recalled product they have in their possession. According to the USDA, Listeriosis can cause symptoms including fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions, and can be treated with antibiotics. However, the infection can be more serious in older adults and people with weakened immune systems, and can be life-threatening for pregnant women and newborn babies.

Food safety experts, including Michelle Anstey and Dr. Bryan Quoc Le, emphasized the dangers of listeria and the importance of trust in food companies.

Dr. Le added, 'It's not like you flip a coin and everything is OK.' The USDA has posted a list of impacted products and urged establishments not to serve or use them.

**Boar's Head shutters Virginia plant linked to listeria outbreak**
Boar's Head is shutting down its Jarratt, Va., plant, which was linked to a deadly listeria outbreak that hospitalized at least 57 people across 18 states and resulted in 9 deaths. The company started recalling 7 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products in July due to possible listeria contamination. An investigation identified a specific production process at the Jarratt facility as the root cause of the contamination, which will be permanently discontinued. The company has reached an agreement with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400 Union to transfer or provide severance packages to over 500 affected employees. The CDC recommends checking homes for recalled products with 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels, which have sell by dates into October 2024.
