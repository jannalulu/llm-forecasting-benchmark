**Top 10 Richest People in 2024 with Greatest Increase in Wealth**
According to Forbes, the top 10 richest people in 2024 with the greatest increase in wealth are led by Elon Musk, with a net worth of $1190 billion, followed by Larry Ellison and Jensen Huang, with increases of $832 billion and $800 billion respectively. The total net worth of the top 10 richest people increased by approximately $5850 billion. The increase in wealth is largely due to the surge in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, with companies such as Tesla, Oracle, and Nvidia experiencing significant growth. Musk's wealth has increased by $1190 billion, largely due to the success of Tesla's autonomous driving and robotics technology, as well as the boost in Tesla's stock price. Oracle's Larry Ellison has seen his net worth increase by $832 billion, thanks to his ownership of approximately 40% of Oracle's cloud business. Nvidia's Jensen Huang has seen his net worth increase by $800 billion, thanks to the company's strong performance in the AI chip market. Other notable individuals on the list include Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Michael Dell, who have all seen significant increases in their net worth due to their investments in AI.

**Wall Street Marks Its Best Month of the Year So Far**
US stocks ended the month on a high note, marking the best month of the year so far. Despite concerns about global economic risks, investor optimism remains strong, with earnings growth forecasts for 2025 in the US remaining at around 15%, according to William Davies, global chief investment officer at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. Chinese stocks also rallied, with the CSI 300 Index jumping as much as 2.3% on Friday, driven by expectations of greater economic support at a key policy meeting in December. 'Earnings growth forecasts for 2025 in the US remain optimistic, at around 15%,' said Davies. 'This continued resilience is to some extent a little surprising, because the global economy is not without risks as we move into 2025.'

**G20 Leaders Call for Global Tax on Billionaires**
Leaders of the G20 have called for a future global tax on the world's billionaires, with the proceeds going towards vital projects. According to a statement from the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the leaders support the idea of this type of tax without providing a clear plan for its implementation or a specific start date. The statement said, 'We will strive, in full respect for fiscal sovereignty, to engage in a collaborative manner to ensure the effective taxation of the wealthiest individuals.' Brazilian President Lula da Silva has previously called for the implementation of this type of tax on the wealthiest individuals, which was included in the joint statement despite Argentina's opposition. Brazil had previously proposed a plan that would require billionaires to pay 2% of their assets in annual taxes, generating $250 billion in revenue that could be used to combat hunger, conflicts, and pandemics, as well as protect the environment. Such a tax would affect around 3,000 people worldwide, according to Bloomberg's billionaire index, including around 100 in Latin America. Elon Musk, the world's richest man with an estimated $330 billion, is set to take on a new role as chairman of the US government's efficiency committee in January 2025. Economies led by female leaders, such as the UK, France, Switzerland, and the US under President Joe Biden, are considering taxing the wealthy amid financial challenges. According to a Forbes article in October 2024, the combined wealth of the world's top 10 individuals is around $1.75 trillion, a $85 billion increase from June 2024. G20 finance ministers announced in July 2024 that 'inequality in wealth and income undermines economic growth and social cohesion, and exacerbates social vulnerabilities.' In the context, Reuters reported that Biden pledged a $4 billion contribution to the International Development Association, a fund managed by the World Bank, to help the world's poorest countries. Biden announced the US commitment in a closed session of the G20 summit. The amount is a record, exceeding the $3.5 billion pledged by Washington in the previous round of boosting the fund's resources in December 2021.

**The Role of Billionaires in the US Presidential Election**
The article discusses the role of billionaires in the US presidential election, focusing on their donations to the campaigns of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. According to Bloomberg, the 48 richest people in the US, with a combined wealth of over $1.006 trillion, donated at least $407 million to both Democrats and Republicans. However, some billionaires, such as Charles Koch, Rupert Murdoch, and Mark Zuckerberg, chose not to publicly disclose their donations. The article highlights the differences in donation patterns between Democrats and Republicans, with Democrats receiving more donations from women and Republicans receiving more donations from men. The article also notes that the richest donors tend to be more generous to their preferred candidates, with a median donation of 0.012% of their wealth for Republican donors and 0.007% for Democratic donors. The article also discusses the influence of billionaires on the election, with some, such as Warren Buffett, publicly supporting or opposing candidates. However, Buffett's decision to remain neutral in the 2020 election and his subsequent statement that he would not support or oppose any candidates in the future, suggests that he may have been motivated by a desire to avoid taking a stance that could harm his business interests. The article also notes that the market's reaction to the election results was significant, with the S&P 500 index rising 4.9% in the first week of the election, and some companies, such as Tesla and Las Vegas Sands, experiencing significant gains. However, the article also notes that the market's reaction was not uniform, with some companies, such as Berkshire Hathaway, experiencing losses. The article concludes by noting that the influence of billionaires on the election is a complex issue, and that their donations and actions can have significant consequences for the outcome of the election.

**US election: World's 10 richest people become richer by record $64 billion after Donald Trump's win | Today News**
The US election has led to a record increase in wealth for the world's 10 richest people, with a total gain of $63.5 billion. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, eight of the nine American billionaires on the list saw their net worth increase, while only Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's net worth dropped by $80.9 million. French businessman Bernard Arnault's net worth also declined by $2.8 billion. Elon Musk, who had been a strong supporter of Donald Trump, was among the top gainers, along with Amazon's Jeff Bezos. The collective gain of the top 10 richest people is attributed to the surge in net worth following Trump's win, despite some of them, including Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, not endorsing a candidate this year. Trump is set to become the 47th US President after winning the popular votes and is likely to win over 300 electoral votes in December voting.

**Trump's Victory Boosts World's Richest People's Wealth**
The world's top 10 richest people saw their net worth surge to a record high of $63.5 billion on Wednesday, according to a report by Bloomberg. The increase was led by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, followed by Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Oracle's Larry Ellison. The gain was the largest daily increase in the Bloomberg Wealth Index since its inception in 2012. The surge in the wealth of the world's richest people is partly due to the rise in American stock prices, which is seen as a reflection of the expected policies of Donald Trump, who is expected to implement lower taxes and reduced regulations as president. The S&P 500 index rose 2.5% to its best post-election performance, and the US dollar also strengthened.

**Elon Musk on Track to Become World's First Trillionaire**
Elon Musk is on track to become the world's first trillionaire by 2027, according to a recent report by Informa Connect Academy. Musk's wealth is growing, and he is the closest of the world's billionaires to reaching the 13-digit mark. In early 2020, Musk's net worth was around $28.5 billion, but by the end of that year, it had increased to around $167 billion, and in September, his net worth was valued at approximately $265 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. James Pethokoukis, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said, 'If we look at the list of the richest Americans, whether it's Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, the reason why people become super rich is because they create a company and make it grow.' John Sabelhaus, a member of the Brookings Institution, stated, 'The inequality of wealth is very conditioned by the prices of different types of assets. One of the factors that will cause wealth inequality to increase, measured in terms of the concentration of wealth, is the stock market.' The 1% of the richest Americans own almost 50% of all US stocks, while the 50% of the poorest Americans own approximately 1% of all stocks, according to data from the Federal Reserve.

**Who Will Be the First Trillionaire in the Tech Industry?**
According to Bloomberg's billionaire index, the top three richest people in the world are all in the technology industry. Eight out of the top 10 richest people are also in the tech industry. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, has recently joined the exclusive group of people with a net worth of over $200 billion. This group includes only three tech leaders: Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, and Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla. Zuckerberg's wealth is largely due to his position as the largest shareholder of Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, as well as the messaging platform WhatsApp. The tech industry has been one of the best-performing sectors, with six out of seven companies reaching a trillion-dollar valuation. According to a recent report by Informa Connect, the value of Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta has exceeded $1 trillion as of July 2024. The report also states that those who own billions today are more likely to become trillionaires, with predictions that the world may see its first trillionaire in less than three years. Elon Musk is expected to become the first trillionaire by 2027, with a growth rate of 109.88% per year. Musk's wealth is largely tied to his stakes in Tesla, the world's most valuable car manufacturer, and SpaceX. He also owns about 79% of X Corp, which he acquired in 2022 for $44 billion, although its value has decreased significantly since then.
