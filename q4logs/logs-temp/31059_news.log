**New York Times Best-Selling Fantasy Novels for This Week**
The New York Times has announced its list of best-selling novels in the United States for this week, in the category of fantasy novels. According to the list, 'James' by Piers V. Eddy came in fifth place, set in the time of slavery in 1861, on the banks of the Mississippi River, where the protagonist 'James' learns that he is about to be sold to a new owner in New Orleans, threatening to separate him from his wife and daughter forever. To avoid this fate, James decides to hide on nearby Jackson Island and plan his escape. 'The Wind and the Truth' by Brandon Sanderson came in second place, the fifth book in the Stormlight Archive series, where the protagonist faces danger as the battle unfolds and chaos reaches its peak after challenging the evil god Odium in a competition of heroes, with only 10 days to prepare for the worst, leaving the fate of the world hanging in the balance. 'The Villain' by M. Gregor McGwire came in third place, about a misunderstood girl named Elvaba who is believed to be a witch. 'The Women' by Kristen Hannah came in fourth place, set in 1965, following a nursing student as she accompanies her brother to serve during the Vietnam War and returns to a divided America, shedding light on all the women who are often overlooked and forgotten, who have made sacrifices and commitments to their country. 'The Fourth Wing' by Rebecca Yarros came in fifth place, a fantasy novel about a fictional world where Violet Sorrensgail is urged by the commander-in-chief of a fictional land to become a candidate to join what is called the Knights of Dragons.

**The Best Of 2024 Mystery Lists Have Begun**
The Best Of 2024 mystery lists have started to be released, with Barnes & Noble and Publisher's Weekly publishing their lists. However, both lists have been criticized for lacking representation, with only one author of color featured in Barnes & Noble's list of 21 books. Jamie Canavés, the Tailored Book Recommendations coordinator and Unusual Suspects mystery newsletter writer, has questioned the selection process and pointed out several books that should be included on the list. Additionally, John Grisham's new book, Framed, has been criticized for not properly attributing the work of Pamela Colloff, who did extensive reporting on the wrongful conviction cases featured in the book. The New York Times and ProPublica are in conversation with the publisher to correct this oversight and ensure Colloff receives proper credit. Canavés has also highlighted several books that she believes should be included on the Best Of 2024 mystery lists, including Exposure: The Return of Ellie Black, Guide Me Home, What You Leave Behind, Butter, Where They Last Saw Her, and A Midnight Puzzle.
