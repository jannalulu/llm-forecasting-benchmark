**Here's what the housing market will look like in 2025**
Zillow predicts a more active housing market in 2025 with more inventory and modest home value growth. According to Skylar Olsen, Zillow's chief economist, 'Buying a home in 2024 was surprisingly competitive given how high the affordability hurdle became. More inventory should shake loose in 2025, giving buyers a bit more room to breathe.' Zillow forecasts a 2.6% home value growth in 2025, with 4.3 million existing home sales. However, mortgage rates are expected to be volatile, with potential swings throughout the year. Additionally, Americans are shifting towards smaller homes and renting as a long-term lifestyle, with the term 'cozy' appearing in 35% more listing descriptions in 2024 compared to 2023.

**A 42% Increase in Rental Prices in Iran Over the 12 Months**
A report from Iran's Statistical Center indicates that urban rental prices have increased by approximately 42% over the 12 months ending in November, compared to the same period the previous year. This is despite the government setting a 25% cap on rent increases in July. The report also shows that rental inflation has been higher than general inflation since August, with a peak of 8.6 percentage points higher in November. Mehrdad Bazrpash, the former Housing and Urban Development Minister, had announced an average rent increase cap of 25% in June, but the regime's efforts to control prices through legislation have generally failed. Rental costs have surged significantly since 2020, primarily due to steep housing inflation and high general inflation.

**Bay Area home values have risen everywhere — except in this city**
Home values in the Bay Area have increased in almost every city, but Emeryville is an exception, with a 12% drop from its 2019 value of $583,000 to $513,000 in October 2024. The decline is driven by condominiums, which make up most of Emeryville's for-sale housing market, with a 15.6% decrease in value. In contrast, single-family home values have increased by 10.5%. Real estate experts attribute the decline to weaker competition for condos, higher interest rates, and a shift in buyer priorities towards single-family homes with home offices and easy access to nature. Additionally, California's home insurance crisis has added complexity to the condo market, with many condo owners facing higher insurance costs and policy drops. The median asking price for a one-bedroom apartment in Emeryville has also declined by 4% over the past year, but remains among the highest in California.

**This housing market map shows Zillow’s revised 2025 home price forecast**
Zillow economists have revised their 2025 home price forecast, expecting a 2.9% increase in U.S. home prices between October 2024 and October 2025. They attribute this growth to low inventory, declining mortgage rates, and modest improvements in home sales indicators. However, they also note that modest increases in new listings and high mortgage rates will limit price growth. Zillow expects the strongest home price appreciation to occur in 10 areas, including Atlantic City, NJ (+6.5%), and the weakest in 10 areas, including Lake Charles, LA (-7.8%). Some housing analysts remain skeptical about Florida's housing market, citing increased inventory and declining condo prices.

**Southern California Housing Prices Continue to Decline**
The housing prices in Southern California have been decreasing for three consecutive months, according to Zillow data. The median home price in the six counties of Southern California was $864,586 in October, a 0.4% decrease from September and 1% lower than the peak in July. However, it is still 4.5% higher than the same period last year. The recent decrease in housing prices is not a cause for concern, as it is a common phenomenon for housing prices to decrease in late summer and autumn. The main reason for the decrease in housing prices is that buyers' incomes are not keeping up with the rising housing prices. Recently, the number of homes for sale has been increasing steadily. According to industry experts, homeowners who purchased homes during the pandemic or with low-interest mortgages are now choosing to move to larger homes as interest rates have risen. In October, the number of homes for sale in all six counties of Southern California increased compared to the same period last year. Los Angeles County saw a 33% increase, San Bernardino County saw a 25% increase, and San Diego County saw a 49% increase. Another factor contributing to the decrease in housing prices is the rise in mortgage interest rates. Although mortgage interest rates have been declining since the summer, they have been increasing since October. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate was 6.78% on November 7, up from 6.08% in late September. Experts attribute the rise in mortgage interest rates to stronger-than-expected economic indicators and the policies proposed by former President Trump, including higher tariffs and a significant reduction in income tax. These policies are expected to lead to higher inflation and increased national debt, which typically puts upward pressure on mortgage rates. Despite the improvement in the housing supply shortage, the industry expects that housing prices will not decline significantly unless there is a recession. However, they believe that housing prices will slowly rise or remain relatively stable, giving buyers a chance to catch up with housing prices.

**Housing tracker: Southland home price growth shows signs of slowing**
Southern California home prices have dipped for the third consecutive month, but remain near all-time highs and unaffordable for most households. The average home price in the six-county region was $864,586 in October, down 0.4% from September and 1% below the record reached in July. However, home prices are still 4.5% higher than a year earlier. The rate of home price growth is slowing, with prices peaking at nearly 9.5% in April and declining every month since. A housing shortage and rising mortgage interest rates are contributing to moderating price growth. Experts predict that home prices will climb more slowly or remain relatively flat, giving incomes a chance to catch up. However, it's unclear what impact former President Trump's proposed policies will have on the market. In contrast, asking rents for apartments in many parts of Southern California have ticked down, driven by a rising number of vacancies and a shift in the demographics of renters. However, rent is still extremely high, with the median rent for vacant units in Los Angeles County at $2,069 in October.

**Los Angeles rezoning plan won’t spur enough new housing, report finds**
A new analysis from UCLA researchers found that a soon-to-be-voted-on plan to rezone Los Angeles will fall short of its goal to build 250,000 new homes. According to the study, the current proposal will only increase the realistic capacity for new construction by about 30%. The researchers suggest that expanding development incentives to cover single-family-home neighborhoods, which make up 72% of the city's residentially zoned land, could triple the realistic capacity for building. However, city officials had previously considered allowing changes in these neighborhoods but reversed course after pushback from homeowner groups. Shane Phillips, Housing Initiative Project Manager at UCLA's Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies, said, 'The kinds of changes that would be necessary would need to be transformative rather than incremental.' He also stated, 'We know that housing scarcity is at the root of the affordability crisis. To the extent that we are sustaining housing scarcity, we are sustaining rising rents and home prices and unaffordability.'

**Rents slip as luxury apartments sit vacant in LA County**
Rents in Los Angeles County have dipped 0.3% to $2,232 in the third quarter, while apartment vacancy rates have fallen to 4.7%. However, luxury apartments are experiencing a 13.1% vacancy rate due to diminishing demand for newer, high-end units. According to NAI Capital Executive Vice President Tim Steuernol, 'Things are so much more expensive these days, and there’s less discretionary income out there' to spend on housing. Developers are having to offer concessions to attract tenants, and a slowing construction pipeline may increase demand and raise rents in the years ahead. The Casden Real Estate Economics Forecast predicts near-term rent growth of 1% next year and 2% in 2026, with average apartment rents expected to rise to $2,334 a month by mid-2026, a 3% increase from last summer.

**The Real CPI May Already Be at 2% | Investing.com UK**
The official inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is reported to be around 2%, but this may be inaccurate due to the lagging nature of CPI data. The shelter component of CPI, which accounts for 40% of CPI, has been running at around 5% annually. However, rental prices, as reported by Zillow and Redfin, have not increased for the last year and a half, with the nationwide median asking rent down $53 from its all-time high in 2022. The author suggests that rent prices may start falling as existing home sale listings rise, and if mortgage rates head lower, the number of existing homes for sale will increase, further pressuring rent prices. When the CPI data catches up with reality, the author expects that CPI will run at 2% or even lower.

**Southern California to see modest rent growth by 2026, USC says**
According to the USC's Casden Multifamily Forecast, Southern California is expected to see modest rent growth by 2026, with rents rising $65 per month in Los Angeles County and between $133 and $185 a month in the rest of Southern California. Moussa Diop, an associate professor of real estate at the University of Southern California, said, 'Though the economy has proven quite robust, new housing supply and affordability remain on shaky ground.' The region's persistently rising cost of leasing is due to a housing shortage compounded by insufficient construction. Despite slowing rent hikes, tenants can still expect to pay more for their apartments over the next two years. The strongest rent growth is expected in areas near L.A. and Orange counties, with inland Empire rents about 10% cheaper than L.A. County but expected to shrink in the next two years.

**Rent Increase Rates to Rise Following Updated Inflation Forecast**
The President of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB), Fatih Karahan, announced that the inflation forecast for the end of 2024 has been increased from 38% to 44%. This change in inflation forecast also led to an update in the rent increase rates. Karahan stated that the interest rate forecast for 2024 is 21%, and that inflation is expected to decrease to 12% by the end of 2026. He emphasized that 'the tight stance in monetary policy will continue until a clear and lasting improvement in the inflation outlook is achieved.' This statement also highlighted the increasing coordination in Turkey's economic policies. The change in inflation forecast has also affected the rent increase rates. According to the Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) data announced by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), the rent increase for housing and workplaces is determined based on the 12-month average of TÜFE. Based on this regulation, the changes in inflation forecasts have reshaped the rent increases.

**LA could cap rent hikes next year to 2% under new city rent control recommendations**
The Los Angeles Housing Department has released a report recommending changes to the city's rent control policies. If adopted, the new proposals would lower rent hikes next year for 42% of L.A. residents who live in rent-controlled housing. The recommended changes include reducing the maximum annual allowable rent hike from 8% to 5%, lowering the floor on rent increases from 3% to 2%, and removing a provision that lets landlords increase rents by another 1% if they cover a tenant's gas bill. Tenant groups are pushing for lower caps, citing findings that a majority of L.A. tenants are burdened by high rents. Landlords say the city is 'doubling down' on a failed policy, and that lowering the caps could drive small property owners to sell their buildings or spend less on upgrades. The changes will not take effect until they are approved by the L.A. City Council.

**Los Angeles apartment executives breathe sigh of relief over failure of California rent control expansion**
Multifamily landlords and brokers in California are breathing a sigh of relief after residents voted against a ballot measure that would have expanded rent control in the state. Proponents of the Justice for Renters Act, or Proposition 33, argued it would help increase affordable housing, while opponents feared it could stymie new development and suppress property values. The measure's failure comes as local apartment developers are scaling back construction amid rising expenses and slower rent growth projections. Kevin Kawaoka, executive vice president at NAI Capital Investment Services Group, said, 'This will bode well for multifamily investment in Los Angeles, providing clarity in this rapidly changing investment landscape.' Kitty Wallace, vice chair at Colliers, claimed policies like Prop 33 would limit a landlord's ability to raise rents between tenants, putting a serious dent in potential profits and prohibiting development. The median cost of a single-family house in California is expected to reach $909,400 in 2025, up 4.6% from this year. About 22,381 multifamily units are under construction in Los Angeles, down 5% from a year ago.

**Rental Rate Hikes Slow in October, While Annual Growth Continues**
According to the Observed Renter Demand Index from Zillow, renter interest hit a record low in October, with vacancy rates rising to 6.9% and rental concessions reaching a new peak at 37.7%. Despite this, annual rent growth remained steady at 3.3%. Single-family home rents averaged $2,215, a 4.3% increase from last year, while multifamily rents averaged $1,855, a 2.3% increase from last year. As new apartment buildings come onto the market, renters looking to move soon can expect continued high levels of concessions and slow year-over-year rent growth.

**Rents set to roar back as apartment demand surges after building boom**
After a surge in new apartment construction, the rental market is finally showing signs of improvement. Demand for apartments has increased, with 1.2 million new units built over the past two years, and is expected to continue growing. Landlords are breathing a sigh of relief as the glut of vacancies decreases, and some experts predict that rents could rise next year. However, not all cities are experiencing the same level of growth, with Austin, Texas, facing a vacancy rate of 15% and landlords offering months of free rent to attract tenants. Other cities, such as New York City and Los Angeles, are showing resilience, with rent renewal rates growing by over 5% this year. As potential rent hikes loom, housing costs are likely to become a major topic in politics. According to Joe Fisher, president of UDR, 'Probably the biggest story this year that we've seen [is] from people coming in the front door and then not leaving [out] the back door,' referring to renters who are staying in their apartments for longer periods of time.

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved lower annual rent increases for tenants in unincorporated areas. Starting next year, rent increases will be limited to 60% of the annual change in the consumer price index (CPI) with a ceiling of 3% for units under rent control. Small property landlords can increase rent up to 4%, while landlords of luxury units can bump up rent to 5%. The California Apartment Association opposes the change, stating it imposes unsustainable financial pressures on property owners and threatens to reduce the quality and availability of rental housing. Supervisor Kathryn Barger voted against the proposal.

**Campaign to raise LA County sales taxes for homelessness efforts claims victory**
A majority of Los Angeles County voters have approved Measure A, a sales tax increase that will raise an estimated $1.1 billion per year for homeless services and affordable housing development. The measure will turn a current quarter-cent sales tax into a half-cent tax. Elise Buik, president of the United Way of Greater L.A., said, 'L.A. County voters have clearly said they want to go forward, not backwards, and the way to do that is to increase investment in homelessness prevention and housing affordability.' The measure's passage is seen as crucial for helping county officials reduce homelessness, and will keep funds flowing to get unhoused Angelenos into shelters and connect them with help finding permanent housing.

**November 2024 Rent Increase Rate Announced: 62.02% Maximum Increase**
The rent increase rate for November 2024 has been announced by TÜİK based on the October inflation figures. The maximum rent increase limit for this month is 62.02%. According to TÜİK, the Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) increased by 2.88% compared to the previous month, and the cumulative inflation rate from the beginning of the year reached 39.77%. The annual inflation rate also increased by 48.58%. This data will affect the rent increases. The rent increase rates are calculated based on the 12-month TÜFE averages. The new tavan rate will allow landlords to increase rent within a certain limit, while preventing excessive rent increases for tenants. Tenants who renew their rent contracts in November will face this 62.02% increase. This rate applies to both residential and commercial properties. The rent increase rate has been affected by the high inflation rate throughout 2024. The high inflation rate has been a critical factor in determining rent increases. The yearly averages and economic fluctuations will have a direct impact on both tenants' and landlords' budgets and economic planning.

**Keep LA Housed Calls for Changes to Rent Stabilization Ordinance**
A coalition of housing rights advocates, lawyers, and community organizations, Keep LA Housed, are calling for changes to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) in Los Angeles. They want to limit rent increases to 0-3% per year, citing that for 23 of the last 40 years, landlords have been able to raise rents above 3% without justification. The current RSO allows for rent increases of up to 8% plus 1% for gas and 1% for electricity, resulting in potential annual increases of up to 10%. The group is urging city council members to support their proposal and eliminate the current formula, which they claim benefits landlords at the expense of tenants. According to the Economic Roundtable report, approximately 1.5 million households in Los Angeles rent their homes, with around 650,000 units covered by the RSO. The report also notes that a fifth of these households live below the federal poverty line and spend more than 90% of their income on rent. Sharon Sandow, director of communications for the Los Angeles Housing Department, stated that the report will be presented to the city council in November. However, the report's findings and recommendations have already been made public, including the suggestion to eliminate the provision allowing landlords to increase rents by 1% per year for gas and electricity.

**2024 November Rent Increase Rate to be Determined by October Inflation Data**
The expected rent increase for November 2024 will be determined by the TEFE and TÜFE indices. In the past two years, rent increases have been limited to 25%. Now that this policy has ended, everyone is wondering what the new rates will be. The inflation data for October will be announced on November 4, 2024 at 10:00, and this will determine the rent increase for November. Both tenants and landlords will use these data to set new rent prices. The rent increase will be influenced by the monthly and yearly inflation rates. According to the latest data from TÜIK, the consumer price index (TÜFE) has increased by 49.38% annually and 2.97% monthly. This data will directly affect the new rent prices that tenants will have to pay. The expectation is that the rent increase for November will be similar to the 12-month TÜFE rate of 63.47% announced last month. Both tenants and landlords should be careful and follow the inflation data during this process.

**California Rent Hike: What You Need to Know and How to Protect Yourself**
Starting November 1, renters in some California counties will face higher rent prices, potentially exceeding 8.9%. The increases will be based on 50% of the local Consumer Price Index, which may lead to some landlords taking advantage of the price hike. In areas like Los Angeles and Orange, new legal limits on rent increases have taken effect, so residents should be aware of the increases they will face. If notified of a rent increase on or after November 1, 2024, that exceeds the established limit, renters can turn to the California Tenant Protection Act for protection against eviction without a court order, discrimination, and retaliation. According to the legislation, 'most renters are also protected against unjust eviction and large rent increases.' If abuse is detected, renters should know the three key points: 'La mayoría de los inquilinos también están protegidos contra el desalojo sin causa justa y grandes aumentos de alquiler', señala la legislación.'

**US Rents Continue to Rise, but at a Slower Pace**
According to Redfin, the average rent in the US increased by 0.6% in September, reaching $1634. This is in line with the trend of the past two years, where prices have remained within a range of $1599 to $1663. However, in 16 of the last 24 months, rents have been even more stable, between $1630 and $1650. Redfin's economist, Sheharyar Bokhari, noted that while rents have remained stable at a national level, the trend could be 'very different' depending on where you live. He explained that in areas with less construction, such as the East Coast and Midwest, rents are rising, while in cities with a high supply of new housing, such as those in the Sun Belt, rents are falling. The cities with the largest increases in rent were in the Midwest and East Coast, with Washington, D.C. experiencing a 12% increase. In contrast, Jacksonville, Florida, saw a 11.3% decrease in rent. Zillow reported that the increase in rent prices has slowed down due to a decrease in demand and an increase in inventory. Property managers are offering more concessions to attract tenants. Zillow estimated that prices will fall as new rentals enter the market. The Biden administration has proposed a law that would limit rent increases to 5% annually for landlords with more than 50 units. This would affect over 20 million rentals in the US. However, the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders have criticized the plan, saying it would infringe on property rights and discourage new construction.

**LA Renters Face Fierce Competition Amid Rising Rents and Limited Housing**
The rental market in Greater Los Angeles is becoming increasingly competitive, with soaring lease renewals and slower construction driving up competition and making it harder for renters to find new housing options. According to the Rental Market Competitiveness Report, Orange County is now California's hottest rental market, with a 95.5% occupancy rate and 12 renters competing per apartment. Eastern Los Angeles County has the highest occupancy rate at 96.0%, with 16 renters competing per apartment. In contrast, Western Los Angeles County has the lowest competitiveness score (64.9) and occupancy rate (92.3%). The report highlights the challenges faced by renters in finding new housing options, with limited new apartments entering the market and higher lease renewal rates across the region.

**L.A. Records Highest Level of Office Leasing Activity Since Early 2020**
Los Angeles recorded its highest level of office leasing activity since early 2020, with 3.8 million square feet signed in the third quarter of 2024, a 27 percent boost year-over-year. The largest lease was signed by the Southern California Gas Company, which relocated to a smaller space. Despite this activity, availability rates in L.A. rose to 28.3 percent, driven by employers downsizing their office footprints. Average monthly asking rents remained consistent at $3.90 per square foot, but Class A office rents rose 1.7 percent year-over-year. The report notes that the rise in leasing activity has sparked cautious optimism that demand for office space is returning to L.A., but office-using employment growth in the region has turned negative. As the report states, 'Leasing activity will be very closely watched to see if the Los Angeles office market has turned the corner or if recovery is further away.'
