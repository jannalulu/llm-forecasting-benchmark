**Shadow of the Erdtree Could Win GOTY: The Game Awards 2024 Update**
The Game Awards 2024 has announced an important update regarding their nomination criteria. According to their official website, DLCs, expansions, and remakes of video games will be eligible for nominations in all categories, including Game of the Year. The organization stated that 'The Game Awards aim to recognize the best creative and technical work of the year, regardless of the content's release format.' This change may have significant implications for this year's nominations. Shadow of the Erdtree, the expansion of Elden Ring, may now compete in various categories, including Game of the Year. As one source noted, 'it's about time The Game Awards recognized that creativity and innovation shouldn't be limited to the 'complete game.' This decision marks a significant change from previous editions, where DLCs and expansions were indirectly recognized through the nomination of the base game in the 'Best Ongoing Game' category. The voters were already informed of this rule change before submitting their ballots, suggesting that the nominations, to be announced in a few hours, may already reflect this new inclusivity.

According to Geoff Keighley, no further clarification was needed, but the organization has now confirmed that DLCs are eligible for consideration.

**The Game Awards: Astro Bot a Strong Contender for GOTY**
The Game Awards are approaching, and with it, the highly anticipated 'Game of the Year' (GOTY) award. The ceremony will also cover other categories, such as best game, best narrative, and best vocal performance. The nominees are numerous, including Astro Bot, a PS5 exclusive that has sold 1.5 million copies in just two months, with a score of 18/20 from JV. However, as noted by Polygon, Astro Bot is likely to be nominated in the 'Best Family Game' category, which often struggles to make an impact during the ceremony and win the GOTY award. Other contenders include Metaphor: ReFantazio, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Balatro, Silent Hill 2 (2024), and Dragon Age: The Veilguard.

**'Metaphor: ReFantazio' Review Scores Have Made It A Three-Way Race For GOTY 2024**
The release of Metaphor: ReFantazio has shaken up the Game of the Year (GOTY) 2024 race, tying it with Astro Bot and Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for the highest Metascore of 94. However, Shadow of the Erdtree is unlikely to be considered a standalone game, and its expansion status may exclude it from most GOTY lists. The three-way race is now between Astro Bot, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which has a Metascore of 92. Other potential short-listers include Animal Well, Balatro, and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. The article suggests that Astro Bot has the best chance of winning due to its widespread critical acclaim and the fact that more people are likely to have played it by the end of the year. However, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth cannot be ruled out as a potential winner, given its high Metascore and the competitiveness of the GOTY 2024 slate.

**Which game do you think deserves to win GotY?**
The author believes that Astro Bot deserves to win Game of the Year (GOTY) due to its impact on the console generation, Sony, and the gaming industry as a whole. They praise the game's simplicity, pure enjoyment, and quirky mechanics, which are a refreshing change from the current trend of monetization and profit-driven game development.
