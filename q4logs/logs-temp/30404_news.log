**Nvidia to Balance Compliance and Innovation Under Trump Administration**
Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, stated that the company will find a balance between legal compliance and technological advancements under the future Trump administration. He emphasized that nothing will stop the global progress of artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia has exceeded expectations for its third-quarter results, reporting a net profit of $19.3 billion, and assured that demand for its AI-focused chips is not slowing down. Huang received an honorary doctorate in engineering from the University of Science and Technology in Hong Kong. He stated, 'Regardless of what happens, we will simultaneously balance respecting laws and policies, continue to advance our technology, and support and serve our clients worldwide.' When asked if he thought Donald Trump would strengthen controls on semiconductors, Huang replied, 'The science and research in the field of AI are absolutely global.' He added, 'Nothing I see in the future will stop this.' Nvidia has praised China's significant contributions to scientific research, which have advanced AI. The company has become the world's largest capitalized company, surpassing Apple, with a market value of approximately $3.480 billion.

**Age of AI: Nvidiaâ€™s Explosive Earnings**
Nvidia, the world's largest publicly traded company by market capitalization, reported impressive Q3 earnings, surpassing expectations for sales and earnings while offering better-than-expected guidance for the current quarter. Despite this, Nvidia stock fell due to failing to meet the most optimistic projections. The company's data center business, which includes sales of components used to power AI technologies, reported $30.8 billion in revenue, surpassing analyst expectations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that production of the new Blackwell chips is 'in full steam,' addressing earlier concerns about potential delays. However, investor worries heightened after reports of Blackwell chips overheating in some data center racks, which Nvidia attributed to 'normal and expected' customer configuration adjustments. Nvidia's Q4 guidance points to approximately 70% growth, a significant slowdown compared to last year's 265% annual growth.

**The 2 reasons why Nvidia will keep outperforming: Analyst**
Nvidia (NVDA) posted a 94% year-over-year revenue growth in its fiscal third quarter, but the stock price did not increase. New Street Research analyst Antoine Chkaiban attributes this to a strong demand for Nvidia's Hopper and Blackwell chip lineups, with no indications of GPU overcapacity and hyperscalers committed to spending. Additionally, data center power capacity is expanding at an unprecedented rate, making Nvidia well-positioned for 2025, according to Chkaiban, who holds a price target of $173 per share on the semiconductor giant.

**Here's all the analysts raising Nvidia's price target after earnings**
Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) revenue forecast for the fourth quarter fell short of investors' expectations, leading to concerns about a potential slowdown in the AI boom. Despite this, analysts on Wall Street have raised their price targets for Nvidia stock. JPMorgan analysts raised their target price from $155 to $170, citing the 'progressing well' Blackwell production. Goldman Sachs lifted its price objective on NVDA from $150 to $165, despite near-term gross margin headwinds, due to 'growing demand for AI infrastructure' and improving supply trends. Barclays also hiked the Nvidia price target from $145 to $160, saying that the company's 'modest guide and GM commentary sets the next two quarters in a better spot as the company shifts its focus over to ramping Blackwell.'

**Prediction: Nvidia Will Be the World's First $4 Trillion Company**
Nvidia is on track to become the world's first $4 trillion company, with a current market capitalization of around $3.6 trillion. To reach this milestone, it only needs to rise in value by 11%. Apple, the second-largest company, needs to rise 16% in value to beat Nvidia to the mark. Nvidia's growth is driven by its GPUs, which are in high demand for artificial intelligence (AI) model training. The company's revenue has surged, sometimes tripling year over year, and its profit margins have skyrocketed. While Nvidia's growth is starting to slow, it is still impressive, with expected revenue growth of 80% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025. As one analyst noted, 'This is significant because second-place Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which needs to rise 16% in value to beat Nvidia to the mark, was the first company to cross the $1 trillion, $2 trillion, and $3 trillion market cap thresholds.'

**Will Nvidia Be a $5 Trillion Stock by 2028? | The Motley Fool**
Nvidia, the world's largest company by market cap, is expected to continue its impressive growth, with earnings expected to grow at an annual rate of 57% over the next five years. The company's profit margin has increased significantly since 2023, and it enjoys a dominant market share of 95% in the AI graphics processing unit (GPU) market. Nvidia's pricing power is due to its ability to charge a premium for its H100 AI GPUs, which are in high demand. The company is expected to launch its Blackwell series of AI GPUs, which will be 4 times faster than its current Hopper chips and will likely be priced between $50,000 and $70,000. Assuming Nvidia's earnings grow at a conservative rate of 20% in fiscal years 2028 and 2029, its stock price could jump to $214, sending its market cap to $5 trillion.

Nvidia has surpassed Apple in market capitalization and has become the largest listed company before presenting its quarterly results. The company's stock has risen by over 100% (180% specifically) compared to Intel's decline of over 50%. Nvidia is expected to report a net profit of $17,495 million on November 20, which would be the highest quarterly profit in its history and a 89% increase from the same period last year. According to JP Morgan, Nvidia's solid demand for PC games and its growth in the data center segment are expected to drive its revenue.

Nvidia's market capitalization has tripled three times in the past six years, and the company is on the verge of tripling its market cap again.

Nvidia has a stranglehold on the market with an estimated 88% share of GPU spending. Wall Street analysts are forecasting 52.5% annual sales growth for Nvidia over the next five years. While Nvidia's premium valuation is high, the company's rapid growth may justify it. If Nvidia lives up to analysts' expectations, the company could report $794 billion in revenue by 2029 and approach a $10 trillion market cap.

**Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?**
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is rapidly closing the gap with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in terms of valuation, with a market cap of $3.13 trillion compared to Apple's $3.37 trillion. While Apple's revenue is significantly higher at $385 billion, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue, with a 122% year-over-year increase in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Nvidia's growth potential is driven by its graphics processing units (GPUs) powering the AI revolution, and its upcoming Blackwell architecture, which is expected to unlock massive speed gains. Analysts believe Nvidia's revenue will grow around 42% next year, far outpacing Apple's projections of 8% growth. However, Nvidia still generates about half the profits of Apple, but with its growth pace and stronger profit margin, it could quickly catch Apple's profit levels. By the end of the next fiscal year, Nvidia could be right there with Apple in terms of profits. Next comes valuation, where Nvidia's strong growth and brand could fetch a higher premium than Apple, potentially propelling it to overtake Apple as the world's largest company.
