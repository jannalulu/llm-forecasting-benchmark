**Elon Musk's Wealth Tops $300 Billion As Tesla's Market Cap Soars Above $1 Trillion: He Now Outpaces 475 S&P 500 Companies - Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)**
Elon Musk's wealth has surpassed $300 billion, fueled by a sharp rally in Tesla's stock. According to Forbes' Real-Time Billionaires List, Musk's net worth reached $305 billion, making him more than $100 billion richer than Meta Platform Inc.'s CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Musk's fortune has enabled him to potentially acquire numerous S&P 500 companies, including Chevron and Coca-Cola. Musk has diversified his wealth in SpaceX, which is worth nearly $210 billion, and xAI, which he founded in 2023 and is valued at $24 billion. Musk has expressed enthusiasm about heading a proposed Department of Government Efficiency, where he'd lead efforts to trim wasteful spending from the federal budget. Trump's victory has been seen as a big win for Musk, as it could drive up Tesla's market share in the U.S. market and make it tougher for foreign carmakers to compete. Musk has been an active political backer for Trump's 2024 campaign, reportedly donating over $130 million to support his re-election efforts. 'But long term probably actually helps Tesla, would be my guess, yes,' Musk has said. Musk has also been praised by Trump, who called him a 'super genius' and highlighted Tesla's achievements. 'A star is born -- Elon!' Trump declared.

**Elon Musk’s net worth jumps $26.5 billion after Trump’s election victory**
Elon Musk's net worth surged by $26.5 billion after Donald Trump's election victory, thanks to Trump's pro-business policies and deregulation stance. This increase is indicative of Tesla's strong market position and investor expectations of advantageous regulatory reforms under a Trump administration. Musk's ownership of Tesla greatly increased his overall fortune, and this increase demonstrates investor optimism in industries led by Musk, such as energy storage, electric vehicles, and space exploration. Other tech billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Larry Ellison, and Warren Buffett also saw significant increases in their fortune. Musk's wealth boost makes it easier for him to take on risky projects, such as SpaceX's ambitious goals of space exploration and Mars settlement.

Forbes has released its 2024 list of the world's richest people, led by Bernard Arnault with a net worth of $226.2 billion, thanks to the success of luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior. Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk follow, with net worths of $198.4 billion and $195.3 billion, respectively. The report notes a record number of billionaires, with 2,781 worldwide, an increase of 141 from the previous year. The US remains the country with the most billionaires, and the sectors that have contributed the most to wealth generation include technology, luxury, and e-commerce. The fluctuations in the fortunes of these entrepreneurs are due to the volatility of financial markets and strategic moves such as acquisitions, mergers, or sales of assets. As Musk's position in the ranking fluctuates with the value of his companies' stocks, this landscape reflects not only the dynamics of markets and their impact on personal fortunes but also the dominant role of certain economic sectors in generating global wealth. The persistence of the US as a hub for billionaires and the continued growth in sectors like technology and luxury are indicative of broader trends in the global economy.
