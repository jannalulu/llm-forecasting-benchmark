**Richard Branson Warns of Catastrophic Consequences of Russia's Violation of Budapest Memorandum**
Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, has written a blog post on Virgin.com about Russia's violation of the Budapest Memorandum and its catastrophic consequences for global security. Branson reminded readers of the historical agreement from 1994, in which Russia promised to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, and borders in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons. However, Russia has consistently violated this agreement, starting with its illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and culminating in Putin's attack on Ukraine in 2022. Branson argues that without the Budapest Memorandum, Russia would have been free to absorb as much Ukrainian territory as it wanted, ignoring its promise to the Ukrainian people and the world. He also questions whether any country with nuclear weapons would ever agree to give them up again, and whether any country without nuclear weapons would seek to acquire them as a deterrent. Branson concludes that if we cannot rely on such agreements when relations between countries deteriorate, what other options are left for the world before it descends into anarchy or worse?

**Blue Origin Successfully Launches New Shepard with Six Aboard**
Blue Origin successfully launched its suborbital spaceflight New Shepard on November 22, carrying six people to space, including two repeat customers and a science communicator. The rocket New Shepard launched from Launch Site One in West Texas at 10:30 AM EST without any delays, which were common in previous launches. The capsule New Shepard RSS First Step, which made its 11th flight, landed about 10 minutes after launch and 2.5 minutes after the booster landed. The NS-28 crew consisted of six people, including Mark and Sharon Hagle, who flew on mission NS-20 in March 2022. Also on board was Emily Calandrelli, an author, TV host, and science communicator, who said in a social media post that she will become the 100th woman to fly in space. However, this number includes nine women who flew on suborbital flights with Virgin Galactic, which reached an altitude of 80.5 km but did not cross the 100 km Karman line used by Blue Origin as the boundary of space. Blue Origin did not mention this milestone in their live broadcast of the launch, discussing Calandrelli. The other three crew members were Austin Littrell, a risk management professional in the financial industry who won his spot through an online platform, James Russell, a technology entrepreneur; and Henry Winkler, chairman and CEO of Bayshore Capital, a Canadian investment company. NS-28 was the ninth crewed flight of New Shepard and the third this year. It was also the second flight in a month after the October 23 uncrewed launch of NS-27, which was the first flight of the new crew capsule and booster that Blue Origin plans to use for future crewed flights to provide 'expanded capabilities to meet growing customer demand,' the company said at the time.

**China's a long way from reaching this year's space launch target**
China is struggling to meet its ambitious goal of 100 space launches in 2024, with nearly half of the planned missions yet to take place. According to a Beijing-based rocket engineer, 'It was never possible to complete that many [launches] in the first place.' The engineer, who previously worked for a state-owned space launch vehicle manufacturer, attributed China's struggles to insufficient funding, a shortage of talent, and limited government support. Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer and space historian at Harvard University, noted that rocket reusability was a major factor in the United States' lead over China in space launches.

**Blue Origin targeting Nov. 22 for next space tourism launch**
Blue Origin is targeting November 22 for its next space tourism launch, NS-28, which will send six people, including 'Space Gal' Emily Calandrelli, to suborbital space. The crew will experience weightlessness and views of Earth against the blackness of space for a few minutes. This will be the ninth crewed mission for Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket-capsule combo, which will lift off from the company's West Texas spaceport at 10:30 a.m. EST. The event will be live-streamed on Space.com and Blue Origin's website. Blue Origin's chief competitor, Virgin Galactic, charges $600,000 per seat, but is currently not flying customers as it builds a new fleet of space planes expected to enter commercial service in 2026.

**Shocking News (But No, Not Really): Virgin Galactic Needs More Money | The Motley Fool**
Virgin Galactic's recent earnings report showed a significant loss of $72.7 million, despite a 29% decline in costs. The company's cash burn rate accelerated to $118 million in the quarter, but it has $744 million in cash and equivalents, which would last for another six quarters. However, management expects cash burn to rise, and the company plans to issue and sell another $300 million worth of stock to build new spaceplanes and pay for general corporate purposes. This will dilute existing shareholders by 150% and reduce their ownership stake in future profits. The author of the article recommends selling Virgin Galactic stock, citing the company's lack of profitability and the risks associated with the space tourism industry.

**Shocking News (But No, Not Really): Virgin Galactic Needs More Money**
Virgin Galactic announced its third-quarter earnings, with mixed results. On the one hand, the company is making progress on its new Delta-class spaceplanes and motherships, with commercial flights expected to begin in 2026. However, the company collected almost no revenue this quarter ($402,000) and lost $72.7 million, with a cash burn rate of $118 million. Despite having $744 million in cash and equivalents, management expects cash burn to rise in the current quarter, and there is a risk of delays and setbacks in the development process. As Virgin Galactic's CEO might say, 'space is hard,' and the company's financial situation is precarious, with no room for error.

**Virgin Galactic Cuts Net Loss, But Revenue Falls Short**
Virgin Galactic, a space company owned by Richard Branson, reported a 29% decrease in net loss in the third quarter of 2024, beating market expectations. However, the company's revenue fell short of expectations. According to the company's press release, the net loss in July-September was $74.5 million, compared to $104.6 million in the same period last year. The loss per share decreased to $2.66 from $5.57 a year ago, below the average forecast of $4.01 per share by FacSet analysts. Virgin Galactic's quarterly revenue decreased by more than four times to $402,000 from $1.7 million in the third quarter of last year, below the average forecast of $2.1 million. The company attributes the decline in revenue to a pause in commercial space flights due to its focus on producing Delta-class spacecraft. 'Our spacecraft production program is on track, and commercial operation will start in 2026,' said Michael Colglazier, CEO of Virgin Galactic. The company also announced plans to issue up to $300 million in common stock, with proceeds to be used to fund the development of a new generation of spacecraft.

**NM Virgin Galactic workers to embark on spaceship assembly**
Virgin Galactic announced that workers from New Mexico will participate in spaceship assembly at its Phoenix facility. CEO Michael Colglazier stated that the company will ramp up hiring in the Phoenix and Mesa areas in Q4, in advance of spaceship assembly work in early 2025. Colglazier emphasized the importance of airframe and powerplant mechanics, manufacturing engineers, quality inspectors, and other key personnel to assist teammates who have relocated to Phoenix. Doug Ahrens, Virgin Galactic's chief financial officer, shared that revenue for Q3 was $402,000, driven by membership fees to its Future Astronaut community. Ahrens also stated that the company's balance sheet 'remains strong,' with $744 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Virgin Galactic projects an uptick in spending for Q1 2025, with costs thereafter 'meaningfully reduced' due to progress toward assembly and testing of two new Delta spaceships. The company expects to double revenue and quadruple EBITDA by 2026, leveraging its fixed-cost base at Spaceport America in New Mexico.

**Virgin Galactic Falls on Earnings Drop, New Share Issuance**
Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. declined after reporting third-quarter revenue of $0.4 million, short of the $0.53 million consensus of analysts. The company also announced an at-the-market equity program to sell shares worth as much as $300 million to fund its next-generation spaceflight fleet. Virgin has been burning through $120 million in cash a quarter after pausing its space tourism trips. The company's last flight took place in June, and it's halted further trips while working on its more advanced Delta spaceship expected to enter commercial service in 2026. Virgin aims to have a second 'mothership' operational around 2028 and expects to clear its existing backlog of around 700 ticket holders in about a year.

**Virgin Galactic to Raise $300 Million to Accelerate Spaceplane Production**
Virgin Galactic plans to raise an additional $300 million to accelerate the production of suborbital spaceplanes and the basic aircraft. According to CEO Michael Colglazier, 'this will allow Virgin Galactic to achieve economies of scale from existing investments, build a second mothership and two additional Delta-class vehicles much sooner than if they were financed solely through organic growth.' The company plans to use the additional capital to accelerate work on two more Delta-class vehicles and a second basic aircraft, allowing them to enter commercial operation in 2028, two years earlier than previously planned. According to CFO Doug Hurley, this will result in 'full utilization' of the 'Spaceport America' in New Mexico and double revenue, while increasing EBITDA by four times. Virgin Galactic plans to begin designing the second mothership in 2025, transition to production in 2026, and conduct testing in 2027, before entering commercial operation in 2028. The company will build this aircraft in-house, using engineering and production workforce that will be transferred from work on Delta-class spaceplanes. Work on the first Delta-class vehicles is progressing well, with subcontractors Bell Textron and Qarbon Aerospace making progress in developing tools and components for the vehicles. Assembly of the first Delta-class vehicle is on schedule and will begin in the first quarter of 2025 at the company's new facility near Phoenix, with rollout and ground testing planned for the second half of 2025.

**Virgin Galactic seeks to raise money to accelerate growth of spaceplane fleet**
Virgin Galactic is seeking to raise $300 million in additional capital to accelerate the production of suborbital spaceplanes and a mothership aircraft. The company plans to use the funds to add two more Delta-class spaceplanes and a second mothership to its fleet, which will enter commercial service in 2028, two years earlier than previously projected. This will result in a 'fully utilized' Spaceport America in New Mexico, doubling revenue and quadrupling earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Virgin Galactic's chief executive, Michael Colglazier, said, 'We have an exciting opportunity to capture economies of scale from our existing investments.' The company has sufficient cash to bring the first two Delta-class vehicles into service, but needs the additional funding to accelerate work on the additional spaceplanes and mothership. Most of the capital will go towards development of a second mothership, which will be built internally by Virgin Galactic.

**Virgin Galactic Announces Departure of High-Ranking Executive**
Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPCE) has announced the departure of Alistair Burns, Senior Vice President and Director of Information, effective November 27, 2024. The company stated that Burns' decision to resign was not due to any disagreement with Virgin Galactic regarding its operations, policies, or practices.

**Virgin Galactic (NYSE: SPCE) Stock Price Prediction: 2024, 2025, 2030**
Virgin Galactic's stock price has plummeted over 84% year-to-date, but analysts remain mixed on the company's potential for future growth. Despite the stock's struggles, consensus price targets remain relatively high, suggesting that analysts believe the company has potential for future growth. The company's first commercial launch is expected to generate significant media attention and investor interest, and the year 2025 is shaping up to be a big one for Virgin Galactic stock. However, the company must overcome significant financial and regulatory hurdles to achieve profitable citizen spaceflights. Analysts are mixed on the stock, with price targets ranging from $0.75 to $47, and the company's short interest is over 25%, adding a potential element of short squeeze volatility. Despite these concerns, the consensus price target on SPCE shares still suggests a double-digit upside, offering hope for long-term investors who believe in Virgin Galactic's future trajectory.

**Virgin Galactic's Richard Branson to co-pilot Space Perspective's first crewed balloon flight**
Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Galactic, is investing in and co-piloting the first crewed flight of Space Perspective's pressurized capsule and enormous hydrogen balloon. The mission, which may launch in late 2025, will take off from the Gulf of Mexico and reach an altitude of 19 miles above the Earth's surface. Space Perspective's co-founder, Taber MacCallum, said, 'Richard is both a legendary balloonist and he's inspired a generation of entrepreneurs.' Branson has extensive ballooning experience, having broken world records by crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in hot air balloons. The company hopes to launch commercial passenger service in 2026, offering 'space lounge' capsules with Wi-Fi and cocktail service. Before that, eight to 10 more uncrewed test flights will occur, and MacCallum will also fly on the inaugural human mission alongside Branson and fellow co-founder Jane Poynter.

**Commercial Suborbital Space Launches May Face Insurance Challenges**
Companies conducting commercial suborbital space launches may face difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage after the expiration of the liability protection law in the US. According to a report by PwC Strategy& and the Italian National Aerospace Authority, the high cost of insurance for suborbital space flights will be due to the novelty of this activity. With only 54 unique rocket engine launches having taken place, including demonstrations, tests, and commercial flights, and 73 passengers having participated in space flights, the insurance companies will likely factor in the test launches, resulting in a failure rate of 5-8%. However, as Marco Cattadori from PwC Strategy& notes, as the number of commercial suborbital space flights increases, the number of failed launches will decrease. The current US legislation protects commercial companies from liability claims as long as the operator provides sufficient warnings and the space flight participants assume the risks. However, this law expires on January 1, 2025, and companies may face difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for passenger injury risks. The authors of the study considered insurance coverage for individual passengers ranging from $300,000 to $5 million. If liability were set at $3 million per person, an operator of a six-seat vehicle, such as the Delta-class spacecraft from Virgin Galactic, would pay between $1.3 million and $2.1 million for coverage of $18 million. The high cost of insurance may lead to a 30-60% increase in launch prices. However, experts believe this is a temporary issue, and as the failure rates of space vehicles decrease, insurance premiums will also decrease.

**When Is Virgin Galactic's Next Launch?**
Virgin Galactic has successfully completed 12 spaceflights, including their most recent, 'Galactic 07,' the final commercial flight of the VSS Unity. The company is now moving towards a new phase of business with the production of Delta class spaceships, which are expected to be ready for commercial spaceflight by 2026. Virgin Galactic has a storied past, having partnered with Scaled Composites to create SpaceShipOne, the first privately funded spacecraft to reach space. The company has faced setbacks, including a tragic accident in 2014, but has implemented design modifications and safety improvements, leading to the development of VSS Unity. Virgin Galactic has made history with its first fully crewed flight in 2021 and has conducted several more crewed flights, including commercial missions. The company is now taking a break from flights to focus on construction and testing of their new space vehicles.

**Virgin Galactic shares hold steady with $10 target from Jefferies By Investing.com**
Jefferies maintained a positive outlook on Virgin Galactic, reiterating a Buy rating and a $10.00 price target. The company is preparing for the introduction of its Delta spaceship in 2026, which is expected to significantly ramp up operations. Virgin Galactic anticipates peak free cash flow usage in 2024, with a reduction in 2025 as one-time costs decline. The company has already booked 700 customers from 60 countries, targeting a market of 300,000 potential customers. The Delta spaceship's design, featuring a replaceable rocket motor, is expected to allow hundreds of flights annually. Virgin Galactic's scale-up strategy is designed to leverage fixed costs and improve margins, with EBITDA margins of 20 to 25% expected with the initial fleet, increasing to 48% with four spaceships and two motherships. Despite facing a significant price target cut from Morgan Stanley, Virgin Galactic has made significant progress in the development of its Delta Class spaceships and projects substantial revenue growth, with an annual revenue target of $450 million with its initial fleet, potentially reaching $2 billion as its fleet and spaceports expand.

**Bank downgrades Virgin Galactic**
Morgan Stanley has downgraded Virgin Galactic's share price target from $35 to $5, citing ongoing challenges and a lack of near-term catalysts for the stock. The bank notes that Virgin Galactic's business model relies on delivering a new fleet on schedule and at cost, which has not been achieved.
