**Suggesting a Novel Technique to Find the Elusive Planet 9**
Astronomers have been searching for a new planet in the outer reaches of the solar system since William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781. Although Pluto and other dwarf planets have been found beyond Neptune's orbit, no large planet comparable to Earth or larger has been detected. The existence of 'Planet 9' or 'Planet X' remains a mystery. Indirect evidence suggests a massive planet may be responsible for peculiar orbital patterns in trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). A recent study proposes a novel approach to search for evidence of this hypothetical planet using a network of small telescopes. The method involves observing occultations, where a celestial body passes in front of a star, blocking its light. This allows astronomers to measure the object's orbit and shape. The study suggests building a network of 200 40-cm telescopes, spaced 5 km apart, to observe occultations from multiple viewpoints. Simulations indicate this system could detect approximately 1800 new TNOs in 10 years and identify Planet 9 if it exists, has a mass of at least five times that of Earth, and is within 800 astronomical units (AU) of the Sun. The estimated cost of the project is $15 million, a relatively low cost compared to other large-scale astronomical projects.

**New Method to Detect Planet 9: A Network of Small Telescopes**
Astronomers have been searching for the mysterious Planet 9 for a long time. There is a suspicion that there is another planet in our solar system, but so far, there is no evidence. Scientists have now come up with a new way to detect the planet. They noticed a strange clustering of the orbits of Transneptunian Objects (TNOs) and Kuiper Belt objects, which could be caused by a super-Earth at the edge of our solar system. If this is the case, the planet could have a mass of five times that of Earth, at a distance of ten times that of Neptune. To find the planet, astronomers propose to use a network of 200 small telescopes, each with a diameter of 40 cm, spaced 5 kilometers apart. This would allow them to measure the orbits and dimensions of TNOs with high accuracy. They estimate that during a 10-year study, around 1800 new TNOs could be discovered. Simulations show that this system could provide clear evidence of an object with a mass of five times that of Earth within 800 AU of the Sun. Even if Planet X does not exist, the project could greatly increase our knowledge of the distant solar system and help us understand how sunlight affects the orbits of small objects in the solar system.

**The best way to find planet nine might be hundreds of tiny telescopes**
Astronomers have been searching for 'Planet X', a hypothetical planet on the outer edge of the solar system, but have found no evidence. However, some research suggests that there may be an odd bit of orbital clustering among Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), which could be caused by a super-Earth. A new paper proposes a novel way to gather evidence of Planet X using an occultation array of 200 40-cm telescopes spaced 5 kilometers apart. This array would allow astronomers to map the orbits and sizes of TNOs, potentially detecting clear evidence of a 5 Earth-mass body within 800 AU of the sun. The study could prove the existence of Planet X, and even if it fails, it would add to our understanding of the distant solar system and the effects of sunlight on small solar system bodies.

**Scientists Propose Hypothesis of a Ninth Planet in the Solar System**
Scientists have proposed an unexpected hypothesis about the existence of a Ninth planet in the Solar system, which is believed to be a massive object located far beyond Neptune's orbit. The object's gravity is thought to affect the orbits of trans-Neptunian objects, a group of icy bodies that orbit beyond Neptune. However, the uncertainties in the data, caused by the peculiarities of observations, cast doubt on these conclusions. An alternative theory suggests that the Ninth planet is a primary black hole, which could have formed in the early universe. The emission of Hawking radiation from the black hole's event horizon may be the key to its detection, but it is so weak that current instruments are unable to detect it. The search for the Ninth planet is complicated by its likely distance from the Sun, but if it is found, a future mission could not only confirm the hypothesis but also open up new avenues for studying the laws of physics. By comparing data on gravity and quantum mechanics, scientists could make significant progress in understanding the nature of black holes and the universe as a whole.

Astronomers have been searching for Planet Nine, a hypothetical planet on the outer edge of the solar system, but have found no evidence. However, a new study proposes a novel approach to find it using hundreds of tiny telescopes. By creating an occultation array, astronomers can measure the orbits and sizes of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), which could reveal the presence of a 5 Earth-mass planet. The study estimates that over 10 years, they could detect 1,800 new TNOs and find evidence of Planet X if it exists. The project would cost around $15 million and would also contribute to our understanding of the distant solar system and the effects of sunlight on small solar system bodies. As Dr. [insert name] said, 'The idea is based on a phenomenon known as occultation, which is when an asteroid or planetary body passes in front of a star.'

**New Study Provides Evidence for the Existence of Planet 9**
A recent study has found a new class of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) that cross Neptune's orbit, providing evidence for the existence of a massive, undiscovered planet known as Planet 9 (P9). The study used simulations to show the gravitational perturbations of all giant planets, the galactic tide, and passing stars. These simulations, which take into account the movements of planets and the early evolution of the Sun within a star cluster, reveal that the orbital architecture of this group aligns closely with the predictions of the model that includes a ninth planet. The study provides a new line of evidence supporting the existence of P9 and makes a series of predictions that could be verified in the near future. According to the study, the scenario with Planet 9 has a high level of confidence, suggesting that the presence of P9 is the most plausible explanation for the observed anomalies in the orbits of TNOs. 'This is not just a search for a new planet, but also an exploration of the dynamic processes that have shaped our solar system,' said the study. 'The discovery and characterization of TNOs have been fundamental in reimagining the long-term evolution of our solar system.'

**The Search for the 'Ninth Planet' Gains Momentum with New Research and Technologies**
The search for the 'ninth planet' in our Solar System has gained momentum with new research and advanced technologies, according to the Discover magazine. The theory of the 'Ninth Planet' arose from the orbits of distant objects, such as comets and asteroids, which are difficult to explain with existing Solar System models. Physicist Amir Siraj from Princeton recently conducted simulations suggesting the presence of a hidden planet behind Neptune with parameters different from those previously proposed. However, this does not yet prove the existence of another planet in our system. The Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, which is expected to start operations in 2025, will conduct an all-sky survey using the largest digital camera in history, providing unprecedented data that may reveal this enigmatic planet. The search also involves the Keck and Subaru telescopes, as well as the Backyard Worlds project. As Siraj said, 'This will give us unprecedented data and may open up this mysterious planet.'

**The Search for Planet Nine: A Hidden World in Our Solar System?**
Astronomers believe that there may be a hidden planet in our solar system, which they call 'Planet Nine'. The planet is thought to be a 'super-Earth', with a mass of five to seven times that of our planet, and an orbital period of 10,000 to 20,000 years. The existence of Planet Nine is supported by the behavior of other objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. However, not all scientists agree on the existence of Planet Nine, and some have proposed alternative theories to explain the observed behavior of the objects in the Kuiper Belt. The debate is ongoing, and the search for more evidence continues. A new telescope, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is expected to be completed in 2025 and will be able to search the entire sky for signs of Planet Nine. 'It's a 'smoking gun' really notable,' said Konstantin Batygin, a professor of planetary science at Caltech. 'And it's obvious in retrospect, so I feel a bit embarrassed that we took almost a decade to realize this. Better late than never, I suppose.'

**Is There New Evidence for a 9th Planet - Planet X?**
Astrophysicist Amir Siraj and his co-authors ran simulations of the solar system, including an extra planet beyond Neptune, and found that the perimeters for this possible planet were different than previously discussed. They supported the possibility of an unseen planet beyond Neptune. A new telescope, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is expected to go online in 2025 and will have the potential to see deeper into the solar system. Siraj expects it to take 'the deepest, all-sky survey that humanity has ever conducted.' The Rubin Observatory may be able to see a planet beyond Neptune, or it may find evidence that Planet X (Planet Nine) does not exist. 'Next year is going to be an enormous year for solar system science,' Siraj says. 'This debate for the last decade has a lot of scientists confused, including myself. I decided to look at the problem from scratch,' he says. 'We did it 300 times, about 2.5 times more than what was done previously,' Siraj says. 'In each simulation, you try different parameters for the extra planet. A different mass, a different tilt, a different shape of the orbit. You run these for millions of years, and then you compare the distribution to what we see in our solar system....'

**Eris Could Become the Ninth Planet**
Astronom Mike Brown, who was part of the team that reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet, believes that there may be room for a new planet in our solar system. Brown and other astronomers are considering the possibility of a new planet, which has been nicknamed 'Planet 9'. According to CNN, a new telescope is set to be launched in 2025, which may be able to detect this potential planet. Malena Rice, an assistant professor of astronomy at Yale University, said, 'If we find another planet, it's a very big deal.' However, not all scientists agree, with some believing that the potential planet does not exist at all. Konstantin Batygin, a colleague of Brown's, said, 'Since Neptune was discovered successfully in 1846, at least 30 astronomers have suggested the existence of different types of trans-Neptunian planets - and they have always been wrong.'

**The Search for Planet Nine: A Hidden World in Our Solar System?**
Astronomers Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin believe that there may be a hidden planet in our solar system, which they call 'Planet Nine'. The planet is thought to be a 'super-Earth' with a mass of around 5-7 times that of our planet, and an orbital period of 10,000 to 20,000 years. The discovery of this planet would be a major breakthrough in the field of astronomy and could change our understanding of the solar system and other planetary systems. However, not all scientists agree with this theory, and some have raised concerns about the lack of evidence and the potential for bias in the data. The debate is ongoing, and a new telescope currently under construction may be able to provide the answer in the near future. 'It's a very exciting time for astronomy,' said Malena Rice, a professor of astronomy at Yale University. 'There's a lot of potential for learning a lot about the universe.' The search for Planet Nine has been ongoing for over a decade, and several studies have suggested that it may exist. However, the lack of direct evidence has made it difficult to confirm the existence of the planet. 'We've been searching for this planet for a long time, and we still haven't found it,' said Renu Malhotra, a professor of planetary science at the University of Arizona. 'But we're not giving up. We're going to keep searching until we find it.' The new telescope, called the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is expected to be completed in 2025 and will be able to observe the entire sky in unprecedented detail. 'It's a game-changer for astronomy,' said Batygin. 'It will be able to find Planet Nine directly, which would be a fantastic conclusion to the search and open up a new chapter in the field.' Even if the telescope doesn't find Planet Nine, it will still be able to confirm the existence of the planet by testing the statistical patterns that have been observed in the data. 'It's a very exciting time for astronomy,' said Rice. 'There's a lot of potential for learning a lot about the universe.'

**The Search for Planet X: A Mysterious World Hiding in Our Solar System?**
Astronomers have been searching for a ninth planet, or 'Planet X', in our solar system for years. The idea is based on observations of certain objects in the solar system that don't fit with current theories. The simplest explanation is that there is a ninth planet. Our solar system is crowded with millions of objects, including planets, moons, comets, and asteroids. In 1846, astronomers discovered the eight main planets, but they have continued to search for more. In the past 100 years, they have discovered smaller, distant objects called dwarf planets, which are now classified as Pluto. The discovery of these dwarf planets has led scientists to think that something else might be hiding at the edge of the solar system. According to computer models, Planet X is at least 20 times farther from the Sun than Neptune. Scientists are searching for visible evidence of the planet's presence by looking for the sunlight it reflects, like the Moon shines at night. However, the planet is expected to be very faint and difficult to detect, even with the best telescopes on Earth. They can only search for it during small windows of time when the conditions are perfect, such as a night without a Moon and the right orientation of the observing location. New telescopes and studies of the sky in the next decade may give us the opportunity to prove or disprove the existence of Planet X.

**Astronomers Confirm Existence of Mysterious Planet in Solar System**
Astronomers have confirmed the existence of a mysterious, undiscovered planet in the solar system. The 'Planet Nine' theory, which dates back to the 19th century, suggests that a massive, unknown object is responsible for irregularities in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. According to researchers, the hypothetical satellite could be a 'super-Earth', five to ten times the mass of Earth. Mike Brown, a researcher at the California Institute of Technology, stated, 'The visually most impactful evidence is a possible gravitational grouping of an unknown massive body.' The NASA has confirmed the crew of the last simulated mission to Mars in 2024. The study tracks icy bodies that are subject to some type of perturbation that is injecting them into Neptune's orbit before they leave the solar system entirely. The extreme characteristics of its orbit explain why it has remained out of sight of current telescopes, as it would spend most of its time in the darkest and coldest confines of the solar system. The interest in the discovery of the new planetary member has been rekindled with the appearance of new observation technologies. For 2025, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile is expected to open, equipped with a periscope capable of searching for direct evidence of this hidden planet, which experts consider the 'greatest enigma of contemporary astronomy.' The professor of Astronomy at Yale University, Malena Rice, noted that 'it could completely remodel our understanding of the solar system and other planetary systems, and how we fit into that context. It's really exciting, there's a lot of potential for learning about the universe.' Konstantin Batygin, a professor of Planetary Science at the California Institute of Technology, stated that 'I never thought I'd be talking about there being evidence of a trans-Neptunian planet, but I believe that, unlike previous times, we are correct this time.'

**The Mystery of Planet 9: A Debate That May Soon Be Resolved**
Scientists have been debating for the past decade whether there is a 9th planet in our solar system. The debate started after some scientists found anomalies in the orbits of objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region beyond Neptune. They suggested that a large planet, called Planet 9, could be responsible for these anomalies. However, there is no conclusive evidence to prove the existence of Planet 9. The debate is expected to be resolved soon with the launch of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile in 2025, which will have a powerful digital camera to observe the objects in the Kuiper Belt. The scientists are hopeful that the new telescope will provide evidence to confirm or rule out the existence of Planet 9. According to a study published in the Astronomical Journal last year, the mass of Planet 9 could be 1.5 to 3 times that of Earth. The researchers are not sure about the composition of the planet, but it could be a rocky or icy world, or even a super-Neptune. The study also suggests that the planet could have a highly inclined orbit, making it difficult to detect. The search for Planet 9 is an exciting one, as it could provide insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system.

**New Discovery Suggests Existence of Hidden Planet in Our Solar System**
A recent discovery suggests the existence of a 'hidden' planet in our Solar System. The search for the ninth planet has been ongoing for 175 years, and new research may finally solve this space mystery. A team of astronomers believes they have found evidence of a planet that is 50 times farther from the Sun than Earth, with a secondary region that exceeds 20 times that distance. The discovery has sparked controversy and opposing theories, with some scientists doubting its existence, while others believe it could be a significant find. 'If we find another planet, it will be something really important. It could completely change our understanding of the solar system and other planetary systems, and how we fit into that context. It's really exciting, there's a lot of potential to learn a tremendous amount about the universe,' said Malena Rice, assistant professor of Astronomy at Yale University. The debate will continue until 2025, when the new NASA telescope will be able to survey the entire sky and determine if the planet exists. 'There are extreme skeptics about the ninth planet; it's a kind of contentious topic. Some people believe with great passion that it exists. Some people feel very passionately that it doesn't exist. There's a lot of debate about what it is and if it's there. But that's the hallmark of an interesting topic, because otherwise people wouldn't have strong opinions about it,' added Rice.

**Is there a Planet Nine? NASA's new telescope might soon answer the question**
The search for Planet Nine has been ongoing for years, with scientists debating its existence due to mysterious pulls in the Kuiper Belt. A new NASA telescope, set to be ready by 2025, may finally answer the question. Researchers have found evidence of a planet with a mass between 1.5 and 3 times that of Earth, likely located in the Kuiper Belt.

**The Search for Planet Nine: A Hidden World in Our Solar System?**
Astronomers Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown suggest that there may be a ninth planet in our solar system, hidden beyond the orbit of Neptune. This hypothetical planet, known as Planet Nine or Planet X, could be influencing the movement of small celestial bodies in the outer reaches of the solar system. The evidence for this planet is based on unusual patterns in the orbits of trans-Neptunian objects, which are located in the Kuiper Belt. These objects, according to the researchers, show orbital groupings that cannot be easily explained by current theories on the gravitational influence of existing planets. 'The visually most striking evidence remains the oldest: that the most distant objects beyond Neptune have orbits that point in one direction,' explained Brown to CNN, referring to a possible grouping caused by the gravity of an unknown massive body. The search for Planet Nine has gained momentum with the arrival of new observation technologies, and the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, scheduled to open in 2025, is expected to allow for precise observations of the deep sky. This telescope has the potential to search for direct evidence of this hidden planet, helping to resolve a mystery that some consider the greatest enigma of contemporary astronomy.

**Astronomy could be transformed by discovery of a hidden ninth planet, says new research**
Astronomers may be on the verge of discovering a ninth concealed planet within our solar system, known as 'Planet Nine.' The hypothetical planet is believed to reside far beyond Neptune, in the Kuiper Belt, a region populated by icy bodies that orbit the Sun. Although no direct observations have been made, researchers have detected unusual gravitational anomalies in the Kuiper Belt, indicating the presence of a massive, unseen object. Michael Brown and Konstantin Batygin, professors at the California Institute of Technology, suggested that an undiscovered planet could account for the peculiar orbits of certain Kuiper Belt objects. Brown proposed that Planet Nine could be significantly larger than Earth, potentially possessing a mass ten times greater. The search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with numerous observatories worldwide allocating resources to this endeavor. Astronomers are concentrating on deciphering the unusual orbital behaviors of smaller objects in the Kuiper Belt, with the hope that these investigations will eventually reveal the precise location of Planet Nine. As advancements in observational technology continue to progress and international collaborations expand, scientists are filled with optimism, with Brown and Batygin asserting that a conclusive answer may be forthcoming within the next ten years. 'The discovery of Planet Nine would significantly alter our comprehension of the solar system's limits, representing a substantial achievement in the field of space exploration,' according to Brown.

**Scientists present strongest evidence yet for ninth solar system planet**
A team of researchers has presented the strongest evidence yet for the existence of a hidden planet, possibly Planet Nine, in the Kuiper Belt. According to the study, this planet is small, with a mass between 1.5 and 3 times that of Earth, and could be an icy, rocky Earth or a super-Pluto. Its orbit would be very distant, much beyond Neptune, and much more inclined compared to the known planets. Other researchers, such as Konstantin Batygin and Michael Brown, argue that an unseen planet several times larger than Earth could be 'shepherding' smaller objects in the solar system. Batygin and Brown have been working on the search for Planet Nine since 2014, conducting computer simulations to test their theories against the presence of the hidden planet. They theorize that its gravitational pull, a 'super-Earth' object about five to seven times the mass of Earth, may be altering the paths of distant bodies in the Kuiper Belt. According to Patryk Sofia Lykawka, associate professor of Planetary Sciences at Kindai University in Japan, 'It could be an icy, rocky Earth, or a super-Pluto. Due to its large mass, it would have a great internal energy that could sustain, for example, subsurface oceans.' With growing advancements in observational technology and collaborations across the globe, scientists are optimistic about finding Planet Nine. Only until the end of 2025 will NASA's new telescope, capable of surveying the entire night sky, determine if a new planet exists or not.

**The Search for a Hidden Planet in Our Solar System**
Astronomers believe that there may be a hidden planet in our solar system. Mike Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at Caltech, discovered the dwarf planet Eris in the Kuiper Belt, a vast ring of icy objects beyond Neptune's orbit. The discovery in 2005 led to the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006. Now, Brown and other scientists believe that the Kuiper Belt may have a ninth planet. The New Horizons spacecraft captured this high-resolution color image of Pluto in 2015. The Kuiper Belt is thought to be composed of remnants from the formation of the solar system and extends 50 times farther from the sun than Earth. A team of researchers believes they have found the most convincing evidence yet that the hidden planet is real. The new telescope, capable of scanning the entire sky every few nights, is expected to be operational by the end of 2025. The search for the hidden planet has been ongoing for over a decade, with some scientists proposing the existence of a smaller planet, while others suggest that the anomalies in the orbits of objects in the Kuiper Belt may be due to a primordial black hole or an error in our understanding of gravity. The controversy surrounding the existence of the hidden planet is expected to continue until more evidence is found.

**The Search for Planet Nine: A Hidden World in Our Solar System?**
Astronomers believe that there may be a hidden planet in our solar system, which they call 'Planet Nine' or 'Planet X'. The planet is thought to be a 'super-Earth', with a mass between 5-7 times that of our planet, and an orbital period of 10,000-20,000 years. The existence of the planet was first proposed by Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin in 2014, based on the unusual behavior of a group of objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. Since then, several studies have provided evidence for the planet's existence, including a recent study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, which suggests that the planet's presence can explain the unusual behavior of the objects in the Kuiper Belt. However, not all scientists agree with the idea of a hidden planet, and some have proposed alternative explanations for the observed phenomena. The search for more evidence continues, with some scientists suggesting that the discovery of more objects in the Kuiper Belt could provide a more conclusive answer. 'If we find another planet, it will be something really important,' said Malena Rice, a professor of astronomy at Yale University. 'It could completely change our understanding of the solar system and other planetary systems, and how we fit into that context. It's really exciting - there's a lot of potential to learn a tremendous amount about the universe.'

**The Search for Planet X: Astronomers Get Closer to the Truth**
Astronomers are getting closer to the truth about a hidden planet in our solar system. Mike Brown, the same astronomer who proved Pluto was not a planet, has discovered a new world with the help of other scientists. To be considered a planet, a celestial body must dominate its own orbit and remove objects from it. There are some indications that a planet like this exists near Pluto, but it's difficult to track and see due to its distance and orbit size. The new planet is called Planet X or Planet Nine. 'If we find another planet, it would be really something big,' said Malena Rice, assistant professor of astronomy at Yale University. 'It could completely change our understanding of the solar system and other planetary systems, and how we fit into that context. It's really exciting, there's a lot of potential to learn a lot about the universe.' However, not all scientists believe in the existence of the new planet. 'There are definitely skeptics about Planet Nine - it's a somewhat contentious topic,' said Rice. 'Some people believe very passionately that it exists, some people believe very passionately that it doesn't. There's a lot of debate trying to define what it is and if it's there. But that's the hallmark of an interesting topic, because otherwise people wouldn't have strong opinions about it.' A powerful telescope is expected to be ready by the end of 2025 and will help settle the debate.

**Is there a hidden planet in our solar system? Astronomers say the moment of truth is near**
Astronomers have been searching for a hidden planet in our solar system for over a decade. The existence of this potential ninth planet, known as Planet Nine, is supported by several clues, including the behavior of other nearby objects. Researchers believe that Planet Nine is a super-Earth object, about five to seven times the mass of our planet, and its orbital period is between 10,000 and 20,000 years. However, competing theories propose alternative explanations, including a smaller hidden planet in the Kuiper Belt. The debate is ongoing, with some researchers arguing that the current evidence is not strong enough to support the existence of Planet Nine. A new telescope, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is set to begin scientific operations in late 2025 and could put the debate to rest by searching the entire available sky every few days. 'This is a next-generation telescope that will search the entire available sky every few days,' said Konstantin Batygin, a professor of planetary science at Caltech. 'It might just find Planet Nine directly, which would be a fantastic conclusion to the search and open up a new chapter.'

**The Hunt for Planet 9: A Mysterious World in Our Solar System**
A team of astronomers, led by those who previously advocated for Pluto's reclassification as the ninth planet, are now searching for a mysterious Planet 9. This hypothetical planet is believed to be five times the mass of Earth and orbits the Sun at a distance that would make a year last over 10,000 years. While several teams are on the hunt for this elusive planet, the question remains: what evidence and discoveries suggest its existence, and why is it so difficult to detect? As Dr. [name not mentioned in the article] would say, 'the search for Planet 9 is an exciting and challenging endeavor that could reveal new insights into our solar system.'

**The Search for Planet 9: A Hypothetical Super-Earth or Mini-Neptune**
The speaker discussed the possibility of a ninth planet in our solar system, which could be a super-Earth or mini-Neptune, located about 10 times farther away from Pluto. This hypothetical planet, known as Planet 9 or Planet X, is thought to be responsible for the unusual alignment of certain trans-Neptunian objects. The speaker mentioned that there are already indications of a ninth planet, with a mass of between 5 and 8 times that of Earth, and that several projects have been searching for it, including the Dark Energy Survey and the Pan-STARRS1 survey. However, the search is challenging due to the large region of the sky where the planet could be located. The speaker also mentioned a hypothesis that a comet called CNEOS 2014-01-08 was deflected by Planet 9, which could be a 'message from the cosmos' that helps to narrow down the search area. The speaker concluded that the search for Planet 9 is an exciting and worthwhile endeavor, and that it would be wonderful if a Spanish astrophysicist could discover it and give it a name, restoring the solar system to its original nine planets.
