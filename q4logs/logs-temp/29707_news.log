**China to stick with 'around 5%' GDP target in 2025 despite Trump win: economist**
China is expected to maintain its economic growth target of 'around 5%' in 2025, despite the potential trade shock from increased tariffs under Donald Trump's second term as US president. According to Zhang Ming, deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Finance and Banking, China's economy may slow in early 2025, but is expected to pick up momentum later in the year to achieve the annual growth target. Zhang warned that the tariff shock from Trump's inauguration will have a significant negative impact on China's export growth in 2025, as exports account for around 20% of China's total gross domestic product, with the United States being one of its biggest trading partners.

**China's Exports Surge, but Imports Decline Amid Trade Uncertainties**
China's exports have increased by 12.7% in October compared to the previous year, exceeding expectations of a 5% growth. However, imports have decreased by 2.3% in the same period. Experts attribute the export growth to possible catch-up effects after previous disruptions at Chinese ports due to storms. Additionally, companies in the US may have stockpiled goods in anticipation of a Trump presidency and subsequent trade tensions. The decline in imports suggests that consumer spending in China remains sluggish. The Chinese economy has been struggling due to factors such as the ongoing housing market crisis, weak domestic demand, and high youth unemployment. To boost the economy, the central bank has lowered interest rates for mortgage loans. Observers hope for further measures, which could be announced this week. A potential Trump presidency could bring new uncertainties for Chinese trade, as he initiated a trade war with China during his first term by imposing high tariffs, leading to significant tensions. Experts fear that an escalation of the trade conflict could harm the economic recovery in China and globally. A spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry declined to comment on hypothetical questions about new US tariffs, stating that there would be no winner in a trade war, which would not benefit the world. German companies in China may further increase local production in response to new tariffs, according to the German Chamber of Commerce in China. Companies that invested in costly diversification and localization since the start of the US-China trade conflict are now seeing their efforts confirmed, as further trade barriers are expected. 'We assume that German companies will continue to localize their global production sites and supply chains,' said Maximilian Butek, executive board member of the German Chamber of Commerce in East China. The trade between China and Germany was sluggish in October, with Chinese exports to Germany increasing by 5.2% below average, while imports decreased by 11.2%. 'The declining imports from Germany can be explained by the weak domestic demand and the fact that customers increasingly prefer Chinese products, which are improving in quality and becoming more price-competitive,' said Butek.

**China's Exports Surpass Expectations, But Uncertainty Looms with Trump's Potential Return**
China's exports in October exceeded expectations, increasing by 12.7% compared to the same period last year, according to the Beijing Customs Administration. Analysts had predicted a 5% increase. In contrast, Chinese imports were weaker than expected, decreasing by 2.3% in the same period. The Chinese economy has been struggling due to a housing market crisis, weak domestic demand, and high youth unemployment. To boost the economy, the central bank has lowered interest rates for mortgage loans. Observers are hoping for further measures, which could be announced this week. However, a potential return of Donald Trump to the White House could bring new uncertainties to Chinese trade. Trump's previous trade war with China, initiated during his first term, led to significant tensions. Experts fear that a renewed trade conflict could harm China's economic recovery and the global economy.

**Why China's economy would be more vulnerable to Trump tariffs this time**
A potential 60% tariff on Chinese goods by Donald Trump, who has been elected as the next US president, poses significant growth risks for China's economy. Unlike his first term, the economy is now in a more vulnerable position due to a property market crisis, unsustainable debt, weak domestic demand, and deflationary pressures. The property market downturn has saddled local governments with debt, while low wages and pensions, high youth unemployment, and a feeble social safety net have left household spending below 40% of GDP. China's ability to respond to external growth shocks is limited, and the yuan's depreciation may not fully offset the tariff impact. Other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have provided unexpected opportunities for China, but these are unlikely to be repeated. 'China may be able to boost external sales in areas where its economy is extremely competitive, but has little control on external demand,' according to the article. 'The burden is huge, limiting China's ability to respond to any external growth shocks,' it adds.

**China’s factory output appears to be growing again**
China's factory output appears to be growing again after five consecutive months of contraction. The official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) reached 50.1 in October, beating expectations, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, said that readings above 50 typically indicate expanding economic activity. Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING, noted that while 50.1 is the smallest possible expansion, it is a positive sign. Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, attributed the figure to the early impact of higher fiscal support, enabled by an acceleration in government bond issuance. Other signs of the stimulus measures taking effect include the non-manufacturing PMI rising to 50.2 and an easing of the youth unemployment rate.

**China's Manufacturing Sector Sees Optimism Amid Economic Challenges**
China's manufacturing sector is looking more optimistic about its business, according to the National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in October was 50.1 points, 0.3 points higher than the previous month, marking the first time since April that the indicator has exceeded 50 points. This suggests an expansion of industrial activity. A Bloomberg survey had predicted the PMI to be below 50 points. The non-manufacturing sector, including construction and services, also saw an increase in activity, with the PMI rising to 50.2 points from a neutral 50. Experts hope that the government's announced measures to boost the economy will continue, as the country aims to achieve a 5% economic growth rate this year. However, the economy has been struggling due to a housing market crisis, weak domestic demand, and high youth unemployment. The People's Bank of China has already lowered interest rates for mortgage loans to stimulate spending. Further measures are expected to be announced in the coming week.

**Youth Unemployment Rate in China Drops to 17.6% in September**
The unemployment rate among young people in China aged 16 to 24 years old decreased to 17.6% in September, down from the peak of 18.8% in August, when millions of university graduates entered the job market, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Tuesday (22). The still high rate highlights tensions in the Chinese labor market and is in line with the trend indicated by numbers released last week, which showed that the overall urban unemployment rate was 5.1% in September, compared to 5.3% in August.

**Youth Unemployment in China Declines Slightly in September**
China's youth unemployment rate for 16-to-24-year-olds decreased to 17.6% in September, down from 18.8% in August. This slight improvement brings relief to authorities after two consecutive months of soaring youth unemployment. However, officials remain cautious due to factory owners' continued hesitancy to hire, with the last positive employment report for producers dating back to February 2023. According to the data, individuals aged 25 to 29 reported a jobless rate of 6.7%, while those aged 30 to 59 reported a rate of 3.9%, both figures excluding college students. As one official noted, 'Despite the slight improvement, we still have a long way to go in addressing the issue of youth unemployment.'

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Decreases to 17.6% in September**
China has announced that the unemployment rate for 16-24 year olds has slightly decreased to 17.6% in September, a figure closely watched as the country tries to revive its slowing economy. This rate, which does not include high school students and university students, is still high but lower than the 18.8% recorded in August, the highest level since the beginning of 2024, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China. The increase in the number of university graduates in June, with nearly 12 million students obtaining their diplomas, has added to the competition on the already difficult job market, which explains the sharp rise in unemployment this summer and its slight decline last month as some hiring took place. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, had declared in May that fighting youth unemployment should be considered an 'absolute priority'. The unemployment rate for 25-29 year olds has also decreased from 6.9% in August to 6.7% in September, and the overall unemployment rate for the country has decreased from 5.3% to 5.1%.

**Youth Unemployment Rate in China Decreases to 17.6%**
According to the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the youth unemployment rate for those aged 16-24, excluding students, decreased to 17.6% in September. This is a decline from the peak of 18.8% in August, when millions of university graduates entered the job market. The rate is consistent with the numbers released last week, which showed a general unemployment rate of 5.1% in September, down from 5.3% in August. The labor statistics come after China's economy reported a 4.6% year-over-year growth in July-September, which is slightly better than expectations but still the slowest pace in six quarters. The National Bureau of Statistics had suspended the release of youth unemployment data in June last year, when it hit a record high of 21.3%, and resumed it in January this year with a revised methodology that excludes students. Economists say this change makes the metric less reliable.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Decreases Slightly After Two Months of Increase**
According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China, the youth unemployment rate in the country has decreased slightly after two months of increase. The rate, which affects people between 16 and 24 years old, rose significantly during the summer, from 13.2% in June to 17.1% in July and 18.8% in August, a record high after the authorities revised the methodology of the indicator at the end of last year to exclude students. The poor employment data for young people in the summer was due to the entry of a record number of graduates into the labor market - an estimated 12 million this year - and increasingly bleak job market prospects, affected by the slowdown in the recovery of the world's second-largest economy, reported local media. The Chinese government has made youth employment a top priority, both due to the negative impact on consumption of potential income decline and the risks to social stability, a vital issue for Beijing. Chinese authorities expressed confidence on Friday that the world's second-largest economy 'will continue on a trend of stabilization and recovery', after announcing a stimulus package with measures to support the financial and real estate sectors and the stock market, in order to relaunch the recovery of the world's second-largest economy. Analysts stated that the package of measures is 'a step in the right direction', but 'insufficient' to relaunch the economic recovery of China, unless accompanied by an increase in public spending, a question that may collide with concerns about the sustainability of the debt. Low domestic and international demand, associated with risks of deflation, insufficient stimuli, housing crisis, and lack of confidence from consumers and the private sector are some of the causes pointed out by analysts to explain what is happening in the world's second-largest economy.

China's youth unemployment rate fell to 17.6% in September, down from 18.8% in August, according to official data. This decline comes after two consecutive months of rising youth unemployment. The rate for 25-to-29-year olds was 6.7%, and 3.9% for people between 30 and 59 years of age. Officials expressed confidence that the trend of stabilization and recovery would continue, but a separate survey showed that firms continued to hold off on hiring last month. As one official noted, 'the stabilisation and recovery trend that occurred in September' is expected to continue. However, the survey also showed that producers last reported improving employment conditions in February 2023, indicating that hiring has not yet fully recovered.

**China's Young People Adopt 'Revenge Saving' Mentality Amid Economic Uncertainty**
A new trend is emerging in China, where young people are adopting a 'Revenge Saving' mentality, cutting back on expenses and saving money. This is in contrast to the previous generation, who often spent more than they earned and accumulated debt. According to Shaun Rein, CEO of the China Market Research Group, 'the Chinese youth has a Revenge-Saving mentality.' Experts attribute this behavior to the economic uncertainty in China, with young people feeling the impact of a slowing economy. Christopher Beddor, deputy director of China research at Gavekal Dragonomics, said, 'young people probably feel the same thing as everyone else: the economy is just not doing well.' The Chinese government's data shows that household deposits grew by 11.8% in the first quarter of 2024, but the International Monetary Fund predicts a further slowdown to 4.5% in the coming year. The youth unemployment rate in China is also high, at 14.2% in May 2024, and many young people are struggling to find jobs or increase their income. As a result, they are adopting a more frugal lifestyle, with some even eating in community kitchens for older people to save money. This trend is in stark contrast to the global Generation Z, who are more likely to take on debt to improve their quality of life. A study by Intuit found that 73% of Gen Z in the US would prioritize a higher quality of life over saving money.

China's youth unemployment rate reached 18.8% in August, the highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

The unemployment rate among 16- to 24-year-olds not in education peaked at 21.3% in June 2023, before authorities changed their methodology to exclude students. The NBS noted that the current economic challenges, including insufficient domestic demand, are contributing to the high unemployment rate. President Xi Jinping previously stated that countering youth unemployment must be a 'top priority'. The unemployment rate for those aged 25-29 also edged up to 6.9% in August from 6.5% in July.

The unemployment rate among young people aged 16-24, not enrolled in education, increased to 17.1% in July, compared to 21.3% in June 2023.

Chinese President Xi Jinping stated in May that combating youth unemployment should be a 'top priority'. The unemployment rate for those aged 25-29 increased from 6.5% in July to 6.9% in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

The NBS had previously stopped releasing youth unemployment data by age group after it reached a record high of 21.3% in July 2023. The new calculation method excludes students who are still in education, including high school and university students. The summer months are a time when young graduates are preparing to enter the workforce, which is why the youth unemployment rate is often high during this period, said the NBS.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Surges to 18.8% in August**
China's youth unemployment rate has surged to 18.8% in August, its highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (ONE). This rate, which refers to registered unemployment among citizens aged 16-24, excluding university students, is more than three times higher than the overall unemployment rate, which rose to 5.3% in the eighth month of the year. The publication of youth unemployment data was suspended for most of the second half of last year after the ONE announced a revision to its calculation method to exclude the weight of university students. Before that, in June 2023, the rate reached 21.3%. Additionally, in August, inactivity among people aged 25-29, excluding those in higher education, increased by 0.4% to 6.9%, while the rate for those aged 30-59 remained stable at 3.9%. The Chinese government has announced plans to raise the retirement age for the first time since 1978, allowing men to retire at 63 and women in physically demanding and skilled jobs to retire at 58, up from 55. This change will be implemented over the next 15 years, starting from 2025.

**China's Youth Unemployment Crisis: A Complex Problem with Multiple Causes**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached a record high of 21.3% in May 2023, prompting the government to stop publishing statistics. After excluding students from the survey, the unemployment rate among young people decreased by almost a third in December. However, the problem persists, and in July 2024, the number of young unemployed people increased by a third to 17.1%. Analyst Jiayu Li notes that the official numbers do not accurately capture the situation, as they exclude millions of rural workers who face greater challenges in finding full-time employment. The government's repression of the technology, real estate, and private education sectors in 2020/21 has also contributed to the problem. The sectors have lost over $1 trillion in market value, and the private education sector, which offered part-time jobs to around 75 million students, has been decimated. Many of those affected were young workers. The government's focus on emerging sectors such as AI and electric vehicles, which do not require many new workers, has also stifled innovation and technological progress. The continuous tensions with the West have also put pressure on China's export sector, which needs to substitute high-value and low-risk orders from the West with lower-value orders from the Global South. This has an impact on employment. The rise of the 'tang ping' movement, where young people reject social pressures and opt for a more relaxed life, has also contributed to the problem. Many young people are choosing to become 'professional children or grandchildren' to care for their elderly relatives, a function in high demand due to the aging population and increasing care costs. The government's strict regulations have also made entrepreneurs and venture capitalists 'extremely cautious' and unwilling to take risks, leading to a 97% decline in new startups in the past six years. Economist Diana Choyleva notes that this is a 'serious contradiction with the government's agenda.' The high youth unemployment rate reduces productivity and will make it difficult for China to compete globally. It will also prevent young people from entering the middle class, which will have implications for consumption and social stability.
