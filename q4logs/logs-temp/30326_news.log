**iHeartMedia Debt Swap Would Push Loan Deadlines Past 2029**
iHeartMedia has proposed a debt restructuring plan to address its outstanding bonds and loans. The plan involves offering new terms to holders, which would push the due date on most of its debt to 2030 at an average 2.5% interest rate hike. The company has outlined two possible paths: Comprehensive Exchange Offers or Alternative Exchange Offers, depending on the number of investors participating. If at least 95% of noteholders participate, the Comprehensive Offers, which include better terms and higher payouts, will be implemented. iHeartMedia has already secured commitments from 85.4% of its debt holders, including 95.3% of term loan holders and 89.5% of those holding the 2027 secured notes. Notes tendered by November 29 will qualify for extra payouts, with a final deadline set for December 16.

**Debts with the Tax Authority: Which Ones Will Be Canceled in 2025?**
Debts with the tax authority will be canceled after a certain period of time. The period varies depending on the type of outstanding charge. For example, for debts related to the payment of IRPEF, IVA, IRES, Irap, or stamp duty, the cancellation occurs after 10 years. However, in this period, sanctions and interest are also calculated on the debt. For these, the cancellation occurs after 5 years. Many debts in 2025 will be canceled automatically due to the reform of the cancellation period. Specifically, debts considered uncollectible after 5 years due to the debtor's death, company bankruptcy, or debtor's nullity will be canceled automatically. For other debts, it is necessary to send a self-help request after receiving a payment reminder. As of January 1, 2025, the following debts will be canceled: tax notices issued from January 1, 2020, for local taxes; tax and duty notices issued from January 1, 2015; and car toll notices that expired before January 1, 2022. Additionally, from January 1, 2025, no more sanctions and interest will be applied to debts prior to 2021, but the debt itself must still be paid.

**iHeartMedia Announces Debt Restructuring, Analyst Turns Bullish And Raises Forecast - iHeartMedia (NASDAQ:IHRT)**
iHeartMedia Inc. (NASDAQ:IHRT) shares have risen by almost 70% year-to-date. The company is restructuring its debt, which has removed an overhang on its stock, according to Bank of America Securities. Analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich has upgraded the rating for iHeartMedia from Underperform to Neutral, while raising the price target from $1 to $3. Ehrlich stated that the company has entered into a 'transaction support agreement with a group of debt holders' to refinance at least 80% of its outstanding debt and extend maturities by three years. This will result in an overall debt reduction, with cash interest being kept 'essentially flat.' Ehrlich noted that this removes a significant overhang for shares, as the debt was approaching maturity and there were concerns regarding the company's ability to refinance its capital structure. The debt restructuring and better-than-expected 2025 guidance make the risk-reward 'more balanced,' Ehrlich said.

**iHeartMedia to Save $200M Annually Through Cost Cuts, Embrace of Technology**
iHeartMedia, the country's largest broadcast radio company, is expected to save $200 million annually in 2025 through cost cuts and the adoption of technology. The company has renegotiated 80% of its long-term debt, extending the majority of its debt maturities by three years and allowing cash interest expense to 'remain essentially flat.' CEO Bob Pittman said, 'The transaction support agreement marks an important step in our effort to optimize our balance sheet, and it provides the company with the flexibility to remain focused on iHeart's transformation.' Technology is expected to reduce annual expenses by $150 million in 2025, while measures taken earlier this year will bring the total annual savings to $200 million. iHeartMedia's third-quarter revenue increased 5.8% to $1.01 billion, meeting the company's prior guidance of mid-single-digit growth.

**iHeartMedia Concludes Debt Restructuring Agreement**
iHeartMedia, Inc. has announced an agreement with the majority of its creditors to restructure its existing debt, a move aimed at improving the company's financial flexibility. The agreement, known as the Transaction Support Agreement (TSA), involves the media giant and its subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the iHeartMedia parties, and is supported by lenders and bondholders representing approximately 80% of the company's existing debt. iHeartMedia will offer exchange transactions to all holders of its existing debt, proposing to extend the maturity of the offered debt by three years. There are two alternative structures for the exchange transaction: one involves iHeartCommunications issuing new guaranteed debt, and the other, if participation thresholds are not met, will see new subsidiaries issue debt after the transfer of certain assets and an intercompany note. The company has also modified its asset-based loan facility (ABL) to adapt to the exchange transactions and related activities, including modifying certain clauses and provisions and increasing the interest rate. These modifications will take effect once specific conditions are met, including the completion of one of the TSA transactions. iHeartMedia plans to launch the exchange offer soon, although the exact timeline has not been specified. The company has filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, providing more details on the TSA, the ABL amendment, and related transactions. Legal and financial advisors have been engaged both for the company and for an ad hoc group of initial supporters, indicating the complexity and importance of the debt restructuring efforts. As iHeartMedia navigates its debt restructuring, recent data from InvestingPro provides additional context to the company's financial situation. With a market capitalization of $274.97 million, the company's stock has experienced significant volatility. The company's revenue for the past 12 months up to the second quarter of 2023 was $3.75 billion, with a slight growth in revenue of 0.99% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the previous quarter. InvestingPro's advice highlights that the company's stock has taken a hit in the last week, with a total return on price over 1 week of -12.12%. This recent decline aligns with the company's announcement of its plans to restructure its debt, suggesting investor uncertainty about the outcome. Despite this short-term volatility, the stock has shown a strong return of 21.68% over the past three months, indicating a certain positive sentiment before the debt restructuring announcement. Another relevant advice from InvestingPro notes that analysts do not expect the company to be profitable this year. This perspective underscores the importance of the debt restructuring initiative, as iHeartMedia seeks to improve its financial flexibility and potentially pave the way for future profitability.

Audacy, the owner of several radio stations including WBBM, The Score, and 93XRT, will head to bankruptcy court after months of delays due to GOP fearmongering over the Soros Fund Management acquisition of Audacy debt. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has agreed to conduct a foreign-ownership review with a new, post-bankruptcy version of the radio giant. According to the FCC, Soros Fund Management will be a majority shareholder of the post-bankruptcy Audacy, but not the owner. The FCC has received numerous 'dangerously false' allegations that it's favoring the transaction because of Soros, and has clarified that the license transfer process is identical to one used under former FCC chair Ajit Pai. Audacy is the second largest radio company in the United States behind iHeartMedia and ahead of Cumulus.

**Another National Clothing Chain Declares Bankruptcy, Closing All Stores**
Salt Life, a popular beach clothing retailer, will be closing all 28 of its locations across ten states due to bankruptcy. The company's parent, Delta Apparel Inc., declared bankruptcy in June, citing reduced demand and difficulties obtaining raw materials as the cause. According to a court filing, 'A combination of reduced demand and difficulties obtaining raw materials have resulted in declining liquidity that Delta's Board has been unable to counteract, despite their best efforts.' The brand will be sold to a brand management company and a liquidator for $38.74 million, which plans to turn it into a wholesale and e-commerce business. All inventory and equipment will be sold off, and gift cards and returns will be accepted until October 20th.

Another national clothing chain, Salt Life, has declared bankruptcy and will be closing all 28 of its stores across ten states. The company's parent, Delta Apparel Inc., cited 'a combination of reduced demand and difficulties obtaining raw materials' as the cause of their troubles. Despite efforts to counteract the declining liquidity, the company was unable to recover. Salt Life was acquired by Delta in 2013 for $37 million and expanded to 28 locations over the years. The brand will be sold to a brand management company and a liquidator for $38.74 million, with plans to turn it into a wholesale and e-commerce business. Customers can still redeem gift cards and returns made before September 20th until October 20th, but all sales are now final.
