**Goodbye Beige and Terracotta: The Top Color Trends for 2025**
This autumn-winter 2024-2025, the color is bold and unapologetic. Gone are the days of the grey and industrial aesthetic of the 2000s, and the neutral chromatic palette that came with it. According to decorator Juliana de Giacomi, 'Before, people seemed to be afraid of color, it was shunned. We stuck to a minimalist, Pinterest-inspired home, and it was almost sterile.' The new color trends for 2025 are bold and vibrant, but not so overwhelming that they cause eye strain. Think sophisticated dark red, warm brown, and buttery yellow. The beige and terracotta of the past are being replaced by the grey pigeon, burnt orange, and caramel brown. These new colors are perfect for creating a feel-good atmosphere, and can be incorporated into your space through accent walls, accessories, or furniture.

**The colour palette for 2025 – these are the shades paint experts say we’ll see everywhere next year**
The colour palette for 2025 has been announced by major paint brands, and it's all about darker, autumnal shades paired with occasional pops of lightness. Mandy Rippon, product manager at Frenchic Paint, says 'There is currently an eclectic mix of colours of the year and paint palette predictions for emerging colour trends... In 2025, we will see neutrals getting warmer and earthier and deeply serene, nature-inspired colours continuing to grow in popularity.' Earthy tones are set to dominate, with rich jewel shades like purple and brown leading the way. Lick's colour palette for 2025 includes both dark jewel tones and earthy tones, as does Benjamin Moore's colour palette accompanying its COTY of 2025, Cinnamon Slate. Dulux's colour of the year for 2025, True Joy, is a vibrant, sunny yellow that can be used as an accent colour or as part of a wider colour scheme. 'Whilst yellow is one of the bolder colours on the spectrum, True Joy is complementary to a vast range of palettes, it brings out the positivity in even the most neutral of shades and is the figurative glue that binds more daring colour stories together,' says Marianne Shillingford, creative director and colour expert at Dulux. The cultural mood for 2025 is nostalgia, which has trickled down into interiors, impacting how we decorate our homes. Lick's colour palette of 2025 features eight different shades that decorators would be familiar with, that would encapsulate that feeling of nostalgia and inspire decorators to think about the colours of their childhood.

**6 Tons de Ruivo para os Cabelos em 2025**
According to Bella Assumpção, a renowned hairstylist, 2025 will be the year of red hair, with a palette of rich and versatile tones that range from natural to bold. The tones vary from soft to intense, offering options that adapt to different styles and preferences. Bella launched the Sertões collection in October 2024, which features three new red hair tones inspired by nature and the strength of Brazilian landscapes: cacau, cor buriti, and ruivo cajá. 'The red hair brings a natural shine to the face and is perfect for those who want a sophisticated transformation without losing naturalness,' says Bella. The expert highlights that the red hair is ideal for those with fair skin, as its reflections enhance natural luminosity, but it also looks great on medium skin tones. 'This color is perfect for those who seek a more natural look, with a soft touch of red that blends with the brown tones,' explains Bella. She emphasizes that the cacau tone values fair and medium skin tones, giving a warm and harmonious effect. 'The buriti red is ideal for warm skin tones, such as dark and black skin, creating a stunning contrast. It illuminates the face and brings a fresh and natural vibe to the look,' highlights Bella. The cajá red is a more vibrant tone, approaching a golden orange. 'This red is perfect for those who want a bolder look, but still with a natural touch,' suggests the expert. It is versatile and can be adapted to different skin tones, especially for those with fair and medium skin and who seek a modern and personality-filled transformation. For those who want to be bold, the neon orange will be one of the most striking colors. 'This tone is ideal for extroverted people, who are not afraid to be the center of attention. It combines with all skin tones, but is especially vibrant on dark skin,' explains Bella. Another bet for 2025 are the warm, reddish tones, such as wine. 'These tones bring intensity and sophistication, creating a striking effect, especially on dark and black skin. It's a color that brings glamour and depth,' suggests the expert. Red hair for all hair types The tones of the Sertões collection and the other red hair trends for 2025 are extremely versatile. 'These colors were developed to value all skin tones,' says Bella, who adds: 'The secret is to adapt the tone to your personal style and find the nuance that best suits you. The Buriti Red, for example, is great for warm skin tones, while the Cacau is perfect for those who want a more natural look.' Hair care for red hair Bella reminds that red hair requires special care. 'As they are colors that fade quickly, it's essential to use specific shampoos and conditioners for colored hair and do weekly hydrations to maintain the health of the hair,' says. She also emphasizes the importance of using UV protection on the hair, especially in the summer, to prevent color fading. With a wide range of tones - from natural cacau to vibrant cajá red - 2025 will be the ideal year for those who want to express themselves through a red hair that is full of authenticity and style.

**What's replacing the 'Unexpected Red Theory'? Here's what colors designers say will be popular in 2025**
Interior designers are moving away from the 'Unexpected Red Theory' and embracing new colors for 2025. Kathy Kuo suggests using wine red, or burgundy, as an accent color, while Bethany Adams recommends using yellow in unexpected ways, such as a statement sofa or a powder room. Kristina Khersonsky, founder of STUDIO KEETA, suggests using any color that feels surprising and out-of-place, such as cobalt or Yves Klein blue. The key is to ensure the rest of the room is decorated with warm tones and neutral colors to balance out the bold accent color. 'The unexpected red theory was the idea that adding a pop of red in a space can be that mysterious finishing touch,' Kathy explains. 'Now, we're extending from just 'red' to the darker end of the spectrum of red tones, like burgundy, maroon, and black cherry.'

**8 Color Trends to Expect in 2025**
Experts predict that in 2025, the interior design world will see a mix of unexpected and traditional colors. According to them, the following 8 color trends will be popular next year: 'Deep, bold shades that really stand out' will be used as accents in rooms to emphasize a brighter and lighter palette. These saturated tones bring depth, elevating the space with a sense of elegance and sophistication. Neutral honey-like shades will continue to play a balancing role in offsetting bold accents and adding warm notes to the room. A designer notes that 'soothing and warm neutral colors have replaced cool, harsh whites.' For example, a soft terracotta brown, reminiscent of sun-baked clay, underlines the rise of earthy and warm tones. A vibrant purple hue, reminiscent of eggplants, grapes, and jam, is expected to make a splash in 2025. This bright color brings a sense of warmth and energy to interior spaces. One expert calls purple basil the color of the year 2025. This bold and striking shade not only pays homage to the plant but also inspires people to make a bold color choice for their interior. Brown tones have become 'sweeter' compared to their outdated look in 1970s interiors, and designers predict that in 2025, shades inspired by desserts, from chocolate and coffee to caramel and macarons, will dominate. Blues of medium tones have been in the spotlight for a few years, but it's time for deeper and more enchanting shades to shine. A bright ultramarine hue is highlighted for its ability to provide an captivating yet soothing atmosphere. A sky blue cobalt tone shows a connection to nature in your home, whether the walls are painted in such a tone or you have a couch in such a shade. Earthy and saturated yellow colors, reminiscent of umbers and ochres, are expected to become more popular as people prefer tones that create comfort and relief. Saturated warm colors based on umbers and ochres create cozy, peaceful, and charming spaces, says an expert. The color of ochre in the interior of a room / Photo Nathan Schroder. The shade of ruby and nostalgic red colors will play an important role in 2025. One expert mentions a 'hot' ruby shade, reminiscent of the fiery tones of the 90s, as one that will be in trend next year. Candy colors will be the accents in 2025. These bright tones create an electric feeling in the room, while serving as a departure from the gray tones often used in interior design in recent years.'

**4 Trendy Hair Shades for 2025: Natural Colors Take Center Stage**
According to fashion experts, the most stylish hair color options for 2025 will be gold and chestnut shades with a coppery undertone. These natural-looking colors will suit all women, regardless of skin tone. 'A soft, golden shade is perfect for those with warm skin tones and a preference for natural looks,' says a stylist. 'For those with dark hair, this color will refresh their overall look, make their locks shine, and add volume.' Coppery undertones have been a trend for several years, as they accentuate eye color, highlight the skin, and make it look soft and delicate. Adding dark streaks to a coppery tone creates an elegant and luxurious look. A warm, natural shade is suitable for blonde and red-haired women, as it enhances their natural beauty and creates a playful, carefree look. Adding a touch of copper or brown to a warm tone creates a perfect outfit without radical changes. Combining gold or copper with dark chocolate creates a popular look for 2025. This color can be achieved using ombre, shatush, or balayage techniques. The new hair color will complement any style - romantic, business, or festive.

**Tintas Suvinil chooses three colors for 2025: Despertar, Marrom Luxo, and Sossego Noturno**
The Tintas Suvinil, a Brazilian paint company, has chosen three colors for 2025: Despertar (a vibrant yellow that evokes hope and renewal), Marrom Luxo (a terracotta tone that connects with the essential and reflects new sophistication), and Sossego Noturno (a hybrid blue-violet tone that represents harmony between humans, technology, and nature). According to Bruna Galliano, the company's creative director and color consultant, 'In a complex and multifaceted time, a single color would not be able to summarize the sentiment of the time. Choosing more than one is a great analogy of how different ideas and opinions can coexist and create new possibilities that benefit everyone.' The company's research showed a sense of community, a new tomorrow, and a new today, which led to the selection of these three colors. The Coral paint company, on the other hand, has chosen Curry Dourado (a warm and lively yellow) as its color for 2025, which is meant to transform any space and help people step out of their comfort zone. The Pantone Color Institute has not yet announced its color for 2025, but the WGSN, a company that specializes in consumer trends, has chosen Future Dusk (a blue-purple tone).
