**What a weak La Niña could mean for Connecticut’s winter weather**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has updated its forecast for La Niña this winter, predicting a weak and short-lived event. According to NOAA, there is a 57% chance of La Niña emerging in October-December 2024 and persisting through January-March 2025. A weak La Niña is expected to have a minimal impact on weather conditions this winter. However, previous research suggests that weak La Niña events are often associated with snowier winters in the Northeast, particularly in northern New England and portions of New York. A close inspection of Connecticut on the map from NOAA shows most of the state has seen more snowfall than average during weak La Niña events. Additionally, weak La Niña events tend to keep temperatures near normal for Connecticut. However, many other factors influence a long-range forecast, and a forecast based solely on typical weather seen during weak La Niña events contradicts the consensus of most forecasts, which are calling for less snowfall than average and warmer temperatures than average for this winter.

**New York's First Snowfall Expected on December 13: Preparing for Winter Conditions**
According to meteorological experts, the first snowfall of the season in New York is expected to occur on December 13, following historical climate trends. This event marks the official start of winter in the city, with significant effects on urban mobility, outdoor activities, and preparations for potential storms. Meanwhile, other areas of the state have already experienced winter conditions, with no snowfall recorded until November 22, the latest start to the season since the 1880s. However, meteorologists warn that these conditions will not last, as a 'polar cross-flow' atmospheric pattern could channel arctic air from Canada into the northeastern United States, causing a drastic drop in temperatures and triggering the 'lake-effect snow' phenomenon. The Thanksgiving holiday, on Thursday, November 28, which is one of the busiest in the US, could be affected by the winter conditions, as stated by meteorologists. 'It's a reminder to be prepared for the winter season,' said the meteorologists. 'We urge everyone to stay informed and take necessary precautions to ensure their safety.'

**Cold Wave from Canada to Bring Intense Cold and Snowstorms to Northern US**
A powerful cold wave from Canada is expected to bring intense cold, bad weather, and snowstorms to the northern United States over the weekend. The cold wave will be triggered by a deep cyclonic vortex over eastern Canada, which will move southward and affect the northern and central United States, including the East Coast. The vortex will bring strong stormy conditions, and late-season tornadoes are possible in the southern states. A deep low-pressure system will develop over Maine, causing heavy rain and strong winds in the northeastern states. As the cold air spreads east and south, snowstorms are expected to develop over the weekend, affecting the Great Lakes region and the East Coast, with possible snowfall in New York. Temperatures will drop significantly in several states, including Montana, North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, with lows potentially reaching -15°C. The first day of winter, December 1, is expected to be very cold, with temperatures below zero in New York City. 'The American winter seems to be starting with a bang!'

**New York City's First Snowfall of the 2024-2025 Winter Season Expected in Mid-November**
According to OpenAI's chatbot, the first snowfall of the 2024-2025 winter season in New York City is expected to occur in mid-November, with a possible date around November 12 or 13. This would be consistent with typical early snowfalls in the region, as stated by the chatbot. However, ChatGPT predicts that significant snow accumulation will not occur until mid-December in the New York metropolitan area, as suggested by the Farmer's Almanac and other meteorological sources. The winter season is expected to intensify in January and February, with the possibility of stronger snowstorms during those months. The influence of La Niña on this winter's conditions is also highlighted, which is expected to bring a milder and wetter climate at the beginning of the season, potentially leading to more rainfall than snow in November. The Weather Channel, on the other hand, predicts that the first measurable snowfall will occur around December 13, which is later than the initial predictions of late October.

New York can expect cooler temperatures and rain this weekend, a welcome change from the hot and dry weather that has been plaguing the city. According to the National Weather Service, a cold front will move across the area, causing temperatures to slowly fall each day through the weekend.

**100-year-old Calendar Predicts a Cold and Snowy December 2024**
The 100-year-old calendar, also known as the Bauernkalender or Wetterkalender, makes a clear weather forecast for December 2024. According to the calendar, the winter month will be cold, with a lot of snow at the beginning, followed by an unstable weather phase with rain, hail, and wind. However, the temperatures will be mild, and the snow will not last until Christmas. The calendar predicts that the weather will be very cold again from December 16 to 20, and then there will be little snow until the end of the month. The 100-year-old calendar is not scientifically proven, but it is based on observations and experiences of people and the alignment of the planets. The calendar predicts that the winter of 2024/25 will be snowy, but it does not make any specific predictions for New Year's Eve. As the calendar says, 'Es könnte winterlich werden' (It could get winterly), and 'Der Dezember zeigt sich laut Bauernkalender gleich zu Beginn von einer kalten Seite' (The December shows itself according to the Bauernkalender at the beginning of a cold side).
