**The Era of Significant Increases in Human Lifespan May Be Coming to an End**
According to a study published in 'Nature Aging', the era of significant increases in human lifespan may be coming to an end. The study, led by S. Jay Olshansky, a biostatistician at the University of Illinois in Chicago, analyzed data from the US and eight other countries with high life expectancy. The results suggest that the average lifespan in these countries is approaching a plateau, with no significant progress expected in the coming decades. Olshansky estimates that only 15% of women and 5% of men will live to be 100 years old in this century. However, he emphasizes that this is not a reason for despair, but rather a test of reality. He notes that while many people live to be 85 or 90 years old, few will reach 100. The study has implications for the field of aging research, which will need to develop new and creative strategies to achieve significant increases in human lifespan in the coming decades. Olshansky suggests that personal health choices, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, are crucial for longevity, but also acknowledges that genetic factors play a significant role. He notes that 'when someone says, 'What's the best advice you can give someone to live to 100?' My answer is: choose long-lived parents.' The study also highlights the need for new approaches to aging research, beyond traditional medicine and supplements. Olshansky suggests that the field needs to focus on the process of aging itself, rather than just treating individual diseases. He notes that 'we've created a set of tools in medicine to fight one disease at a time. To make further progress, science 'must take on the process of aging itself.' Future breakthroughs may come from innovations in genetics, reprogramming cells, and other areas of biology. 'Great breakthroughs in technology happen only as a result of many earlier works that have no dramatic consequences until they do,' comments Aubrey de Grey, a researcher on the process of aging. De Grey is working on interventions to 'repair damage' in the aging process and is testing various combinations of stem cell therapy, drugs, and gene therapy in mice that may lead to a breakthrough in human lifespan extension. 'The goal is to gather enough of these solutions to address the current challenges,' he says. Another researcher, Peter Fedichev, is working on a paradigm shift that could help slow down the aging process. His company, Gero, is working with pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, to develop new targets for age-related diseases. 'If we continue to do what we've been doing, we won't find a solution,' Fedichev comments. 'We need to separate the problem of aging from diseases and then put effort into designing new ways to intervene in the aging process.'

**Scientists Predict Possibility of Extending Human Lifespan to 200 Years**
A team of American-Singaporean scientists has suggested the possibility of increasing the maximum human lifespan, according to Pronews.gr on November 2. Research has shown that after 120-150 years, the body's restorative abilities begin to decline rapidly. The study, which began two years ago, analyzed data from hundreds of thousands of volunteers using artificial intelligence to examine their health, age, lifestyle, and medical history. Despite the limitations of regeneration, science continues to progress, which may eventually slow down the aging process and extend life to 200 years. However, researchers warn that achieving such longevity in the near future is unlikely. As scientists note, technological advancements can contribute to longer life, but a sudden breakthrough to increase lifespan to 200 years is not expected. 'We are not expecting an immediate breakthrough in increasing lifespan to 200 years,' said the researchers.

**Diocese of Macau Launches Large-Scale Inquiry into Elderly Concerns**
The Diocese of Macau, in collaboration with the Institute of Social Action and the University of São José, has launched a large-scale inquiry to understand the concerns and challenges faced by the elderly in Macau. The initiative, which will run until March 2025, aims to interview around 2,000 elderly individuals, representing about 2% of the 100,000 elderly people living in Macau. Jacky Ho, director of the Faculty of Health Sciences, explained that the goal is to identify gaps in the social assistance mechanisms promoted by the Government and to understand why some elderly individuals are not covered by the support network provided by the Institute of Social Action. 'We have seen some alarming situations in recent years, where elderly individuals living alone have passed away without anyone noticing. We are concerned that the current system may not be able to identify similar cases in the future,' Ho said. 'The Government has provided many resources to our elderly, but we know that there are still people who are not covered by these services, either because they believe they can take care of themselves or because they do not know they can access these services,' he added. The inquiry will be conducted in Cantonese, Mandarin, Portuguese, and English, and will involve teams of researchers and volunteers who will interview elderly individuals from different linguistic and social backgrounds. 'The study is led by the Observatório para o Desenvolvimento Social de Macau, in collaboration with researchers from the Faculty of Health Sciences. The project will last for about six months,' confirmed the director. 'With the support of the Diocese, the authorization of our Bishop, and the collaboration of the parishes and priests of Macau, we have started a plan to recruit volunteers to help with the project. Each volunteer will undergo a 10-hour training program to ensure that the project is conducted uniformly,' Ho emphasized.

**The Aging Population and the Need for Solid and Resilient Care Systems**
The world is aging, and the task of caring for others needs to develop solid and resilient systems. The United Nations established October 29 as International Day of Care and Support to highlight the importance of care and to call for investment in the care economy and the development of solid and resilient systems. However, the distribution of care work remains unjustly distributed, with women shouldering the majority of the burden. This means less time for women to work, study, and produce. If we don't address this issue, the problems for providing care will deepen, leading to a severe care crisis with negative implications for gender equity, the well-being of caregivers and those being cared for, and the country's development. The scenario becomes even more critical as the demand for care is changing, and we will need to provide care for older people, who will be increasingly numerous. The cost of not intervening will be paid by all, as the impacts will fall on the healthcare and social protection systems. Contrary to the world's expectations, the 2025 Budget Proposal is far from addressing this issue. The proposal includes a significant cut to policies aimed at strengthening and building care infrastructure for children and older people, with a real decrease of 28% and 46% compared to 2024 and between 41% and 72% compared to the current 2023 budget. Additionally, the budget allocations could fall even further due to the estimated 18.3% inflation rate, compared to the 38.4% projected by the Central Bank's Market Expectations Survey. This cut is part of a larger trend of underfunding, marked by the elimination of a key instrument like the labeling of programs aimed at closing gender gaps and the disarticulation of policies to address the unknown: gender inequalities. Furthermore, the Program for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Older Adults, which promotes progressive care systems, saw a real decrease of 15% compared to 2023 and is currently under-executed, with only around 54% of the allocated funds used by October. The promotion of autonomy in older adults and the provision of adequate infrastructure for basic care is crucial because the global fertility rate has been declining for 10 years, and the population is aging. The estimated proportion of people over 60 years old will increase from 16% in 2022 to 20% in 2040. Moreover, the aging population is feminized, as women live longer than men. The care burden is also feminized, with women dedicating twice as much time as men (6:31 and 3.40 hours per day, respectively) to unpaid domestic and care work. The current situation is urgent, but we also face long-term challenges that we have the opportunity to anticipate. The care agenda will soon undergo significant changes, and many discussions in the coming years will be linked to the demographic transition and the consequent aging of the population. Investing in the care economy and infrastructure, as well as support systems, is a concrete response that has a significant impact on the country's economic development, as it promotes women's participation in the labor market. According to the ILO, investing in the care economy could generate over 1.8 million jobs in Argentina by 2030, mainly for women. In summary, this means an increase in activity and employment rates, which in turn lead to increases in family incomes and impact on the well-being of children and adolescents, who are the most affected by poverty, with 66% of children between 0 and 14 years old living in poor households. Today, more than ever, it is essential to invest, reconvert, and adapt care infrastructure and services to address the population changes that are already occurring. We have an opportunity, but it is now, before the pyramid loses its shape entirely. If we don't take it, who will bear the cost of this blindness?

**Promoting Healthy Aging and Combating Ageism through Technology and Intergenerationality**
The increasing life expectancy is considered a significant achievement of humanity and one of the most important social transformations of the 21st century. The United Nations General Assembly declared the 'Decade of Healthy Aging' (2021-2030) as the main strategy to build an inclusive society for all ages. This global initiative unites efforts from governments, civil society, professionals, universities, media, and the private sector to improve the lives of older people, their families, and communities. The pillars of this strategy are health, social participation, security/protection, and lifelong learning. As a professor of Occupational Therapy at the University of São Carlos, I have had the opportunity to care for people with physical disabilities and older adults, conducting research and teaching activities in the area of aging. I also follow this theme in my postdoctoral research on older immigrant women. In addition, I developed projects aimed at older adults living in both the community and Long-Term Care Institutions for the Elderly (ILPIs), with occupational therapy actions that included activities with the presence of animals, music, dance, oral history of life, among others. During my work at the Group of Optics at the Institute of Physics of São Carlos (IFSC-USP) - Center for Research in Optics and Photonics (CEPOF) - INCT, coordinated by Prof. Dr. Vanderlei Salvador Bagnato, I participated in interdisciplinary teams. One of the projects developed was the creation of a prototype that combines laser and ultrasound for the treatment of osteoarthritis in the hands and knees. The results showed a significant reduction in pain, improvement in functionality, and quality of life, with several volunteers reporting the resumption of daily activities and the start of new practices. This was an initial step, and other teams also contributed to the advancement of this innovative project. Despite the growth of research on aging and the significant increase in the population of older adults in Brazil, there is still a lack of value and diversity of experiences of life among this group. This scenario is exacerbated by the presence of stereotypes and prejudice against older adults, known as ageism or etarismo, which can result in violence and social exclusion. Promoting tolerance to diversity, treating older adults with respect, and encouraging intergenerationality, knowledge exchange, and conviviality between different ages are important strategies to combat prejudice against older adults. These aspects, combined with access to technological resources, can contribute to a more just and better quality of life society for all.

**The Zap: latest health and aged care news, plus a comprehensive list of consultations now open**
The Australian Government's failure to respond to a Senate inquiry's report on mental health and suicide prevention has been described as 'distressing and disrespectful' by the Australian Association of Psychologists. The report, published in late 2021, included 44 recommendations. The Government has used the passage of time as an excuse not to give a substantive response to the recommendations. The report was delivered in November 2021 and provided meaningful solutions to help ease the mental health crisis, but these have been ignored. The Australian Association of Psychologists has waited almost three years for nothing, calling it an 'absolute waste of time and effort' for all the invested stakeholders. Meanwhile, the midwifery workforce is in crisis, with a report by the Burnet Institute finding that there are not enough midwives or current midwifery students in the pipeline to meet future needs. The report made 32 recommendations, including increasing the number of midwifery students and quarantining places for First Nations students. The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF) has commented on the report, saying that it is imperative that the midwifery profession remains a strong, equipped workforce that reflects the Australian community. The ANMF has identified immediate responses to the crisis as including safe midwifery-specific staffing ratios, flexible rostering, subsidised education, and culturally appropriate trauma-informed care education. Additionally, the Government has announced funding to accelerate the development of a national targeted skin cancer screening roadmap, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics has released updated microdata on sun protection behaviours. The Consumers Health Forum has warned of the risks of using a one-off telehealth consultation to access a particular medicine, and the Grattan Institute's Peter Breadon has explored vaccination rates in residential aged care for COVID-19 and other diseases. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has released data on residential aged care performance indicators for the June 2024 quarter, showing a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of residents experiencing polypharmacy, antipsychotic medication use, and falls that resulted in major injury. However, the proportion of residents experiencing many of these undesirable outcomes remains high. The National Health and Medical Research Council has released for consultation draft updated Australian Drinking Water Guidelines, including new limits for PFAS concentrations. Submissions close on 22 November, and the final guidelines are expected to be released in April next year.

The event will feature performances by Puerto Orquesta, María Jimena Pereyra, and the vocal group 'El Otro Cantar'. According to Michèle Mallet Auger, head of the Department of Territory and Networks at Parque Cultural de Valparaíso, 'it is a privilege to be part of the Mesa Creativa Intersectorial de Comunidades de Personas Mayores, with which we have worked continuously over time, positioning a series of activities that take place every year, and that allows this community to enjoy cultural experiences designed according to their motivations and needs.' Nicole Bendek Beiza, in charge of the Program of Promotion and Social Participation at the Centro de Salud Familiar Cordillera, added that 'for us, the gala is a very important instance. The joint work we do from our cultural organizations has taught us that one of the ways of education, also in health, has been this cultural aspect. Through multiple strategies that we develop with our organizations in the territory, mainly with older people.'

**Turkish university's students over 60 prove age just a number**
Akdeniz University in Türkiye has launched its 2024-2025 '60+ Lifelong Learning' program, which has drawn significant participation from older students eager to start their studies. The program, managed by the university's Aging Studies Application and Research Center, aims to support healthy aging and create projects that promote independent living and avoid social isolation. Professor Özlenen Özkan, the rector of Akdeniz University, highlighted the importance of supporting older generations and emphasized that while aging is inevitable, the quality of the process depends on how individuals live their lives. The program is set to expand further, with a new campus opening in Batman in November 2024. Students, such as Müzeyyen Can and Abdurrahman Kozankurt, have shared their positive experiences with the program, citing the joy and enrichment it has brought to their lives. 'We are proud to lead such an important project,' said Özkan. 'Aging is a process that requires thought and attention, and we aim to create projects that support healthy aging.' 'True immortality is achieved through the legacy we leave behind,' she added. 'While science has made significant strides in slowing down aging, it remains an unavoidable part of life,' she said. 'We can shape our own aging process through effort and understanding, just as Confucius did,' added professor Ismail Tufan, the program's founder.

**Novosibirsk Celebrates the Elderly: A Look at the City's Aging Population**
The 'Decade of the Elderly' in Novosibirsk has come to an end. The city prepared a cultural program for pensioners, as well as opportunities to resolve pressing issues, consult with doctors or lawyers. According to the Department of Social Policy of the Novosibirsk City Hall, 11 people celebrated their 90th birthday, 237 people celebrated their 95th birthday, and 82 people celebrated their 100th birthday in 2024. The number of centenarians is increasing. 'In 2024, 11 people celebrated their 90th birthday, 237 people celebrated their 95th birthday, and 82 people celebrated their 100th birthday,' said the Department of Social Policy. For comparison, in 2023, 44 people celebrated their 100th birthday in Novosibirsk. The city hall has congratulated 49 centenarians as of October 7, 2024. There are also residents of Novosibirsk who are older than 105 years old, such as one woman who celebrated her 105th birthday in February 2024. Women make up the majority of the elderly population in the city. Each centenarian's birthday is a significant event in Novosibirsk, with responsible officials visiting and congratulating them. For example, Ekateryna Yurkevich, a 105-year-old resident of the city, was congratulated by officials in the Lenin district. According to official statistics, there are 35 million people in Russia aged 60 and over, including 4.9 million people aged 80 and over. By 2030, the number of people aged 60 and over is expected to reach 36.5 million, and the number of people aged 80 and over is expected to reach 5.5 million. Patients of this age group should undergo regular check-ups, said the regional Ministry of Health.

**Taiwan and Japan cultural exchange advocates for 'super-aged society' issues**
The FormosArt 2.0 program, announced by Taiwan's National Theater & Concert Hall, aims to address 'super-aged society' challenges artistically. By 2025, Taiwan will become a 'super-aged society,' with over 20% of the population being 65 or older. The program will enhance local performing arts capacities and raise awareness about dementia in Taiwan and Japan. According to Sugawara Naoki, founder of the OiBokkeShi theater group, 'long-term care and performances can be connected. Ordinary people can become actors, and our life can be a performance.' The program will last three years, with field studies, co-creation, and partner recruitment in the first year, rehearsals and premieres in 2025, and local tours in the third year. Four aspects of the program include a Taiwanese version of the theater play 'Wandering Night Never Gets Darker,' a collaboration workshop, a writing platform called 'Love Letters to Self,' and a documentary.

**NA Chairman calls for innovative cultural development with minimal budget**
National Assembly Chairman Tran Thanh Man called for further research into models of 'doing without money is even better' in cultural development, especially given the country's current economic challenges. The National Target Program on Cultural Development for the 2025-2035 period has a proposed budget of VND 122.25 trillion, with VND 400 billion allocated for 2025. However, Vice Chairman Nguyen Khac Dinh expressed concerns that the allocated funds for 2025 may not be utilized due to the short time frame and the need for policy frameworks to be developed. Dinh suggested prioritizing sectors that 'don’t require much budget' and focusing on cultural industries to increase revenue. Chairman of the Finance and Budget Committee Le Quang Manh acknowledged the challenges faced in disbursement capacity and emphasized the need for effective disbursement. National Assembly Chairman Tran Thanh Man cited the example of the ancient town of Hoi An, which attracts tourists without significant public investment, and urged the program to pay attention to grassroots cultural development. 'You can accomplish a lot without spending money,' he said, calling for further research into models that 'can be done without money.'

**Decade of Healthy Aging 2020-2030: A Plan for Empowering Older Adults**
The Decade of Healthy Aging 2020-2030 is a plan aimed at changing the way people view aging, with the goal of strengthening services, systems, and communities to better meet the needs of older adults. The plan will bring together governments, civil society, international organizations, professionals, academic institutions, media, and the private sector to improve the lives of older adults and their families and communities. According to the plan, 'giving a human face to a powerful cause' is a key factor for success. The plan emphasizes the importance of listening to the opinions of older adults, respecting their inherent dignity and autonomy, and promoting and protecting their human right to participate fully in civil, economic, social, cultural, and political life. The plan also highlights the need for older adults to have significant participation and empowerment in all stages of the program, as well as in the development, application, and evaluation of the work carried out in the four areas. Families, caregivers, and communities can participate together and promote the adoption of measures within the framework of the decade, and contribute to research in this area.

**Aging with Dignity: Strengthening Care and Assistance Systems for Older People Worldwide**
The International Day of Older Persons is celebrated on October 1st, with the theme 'Envejecer con dignidad: reforzar los sistemas de atención y asistencia a las personas mayores en todo el mundo' (Aging with dignity: strengthening care and assistance systems for older people worldwide). According to the United Nations, the aging of the population is transforming social structures worldwide, with the average life expectancy at birth exceeding 75 years in half of the countries. In Uruguay, 16% of the population is over 65 years old, a 14% increase from 2011. By 2030, there will be more adults over 65 than young people worldwide. The UN emphasizes the need to expand opportunities for training and education in geriatrics and gerontology, address the global shortage of caregivers, and recognize the diverse contributions of caregivers. Matilde Fernández Sanz, president of the Observatorio Estatal de la Soledad no Deseada (SoledadES), notes that ageism is a significant issue, with the media often portraying older adults as 'viejecitos frágiles' (fragile old people). She also highlights the importance of creating new social networks and encouraging older adults to participate in cultural activities to combat loneliness. An article in The Conversation notes that the mental health of older adults is particularly vulnerable due to chronic diseases, neurodegenerative and mental disorders, and significant life events such as retirement or the loss of loved ones. In Spain, the frequency of mental health disorders in primary care consultations has increased from 25% in 2016 to 36% in 2021, with anxiety, insomnia, and depression being the most common. The UN recommends reducing risk factors associated with diseases, increasing protective factors through healthy habits and exercise, developing cognitive protection actions, promoting positive attitudes towards life, and fostering social participation.

**Solving the health care dilemma: Why older adults are skipping vital care**
As a gerontologist, it is disheartening to see older adults disinterested in routine medical check-ups, refusing to follow doctors' orders or take prescribed medications. According to a March 2024 CDC snapshot poll, one in four older adults report skipping or delaying necessary health care in the past year. Despite medical advancements, a significant portion of the older population remains resistant to proactive health care measures. This resistance not only jeopardizes their health but also poses a broader public health challenge. Factors contributing to health care compliance include socioeconomic status, education, and cultural beliefs. Potential reasons for non-compliance include a lack of trust in the health care system, feeling overwhelmed by modern health care, and a fatalistic attitude towards aging. Addressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach, including rebuilding trust in the health care system, prioritizing culturally competent care, and educational initiatives. Community engagement and peer influence can also play a vital role in promoting health care engagement. As a gerontologist, the goal is for all older adults to live their best lives with happiness and optimal quality of life. By addressing the root causes of resistance and implementing targeted strategies, we can help older adults embrace a proactive approach to their health. 'We have not effectively communicated the importance of preventative care,' says Michael Pessman, a gerontologist. 'Waiting until a problem arises often leads to worse outcomes, exacerbating conditions that could have been managed or prevented with early intervention.'

**Fronditha Care Foundation launched to drive culturally appropriate aged care innovation**
The Fronditha Care Foundation was launched on September 25, aiming to improve access to culturally appropriate aged care for Australia's diverse population. Prominent journalist Patricia Karvelas, who officially launched the Foundation, spoke about the challenges faced by older Australians from diverse backgrounds in accessing sensitive, culturally aware care. 'I watched my grandparents interact with a healthcare system that wasn't built for them, and it put a fire in my belly to advocate for better care. As our population ages, we need more evidence-based, culturally appropriate care for all communities,' she said. The Fronditha Care Foundation will provide grants to support research, programs, and advocacy that enhance the health and wellbeing of elders from culturally diverse backgrounds. It has already partnered with leading organisations such as Dementia Australia and Aged Care Research & Industry Innovation Australia to spearhead its mission. Fronditha Care CEO Faye Spiteri OAM said the Foundation will play a critical role in shaping the future of aged care for all culturally diverse elders.

**Amazon's Shift to Office Work: Is the Golden Age of Remote Work Over?**
Amazon has announced that its employees will be required to return to the office full-time starting from January 2025, marking a significant shift in the debate over the future of remote work. While CEO Andy Jassy highlights the benefits of in-person office presence, this decision raises a crucial question: is the golden age of remote work over? Indeed, a job search platform, has closely followed the evolution of French employees' expectations regarding remote work. According to a study conducted with OpinionWay in May 2023, 'New work and company relationships', the culture of remote work has become deeply ingrained in the daily lives of employees: 77% of French people stated last year that they would never consider giving up remote work, as long as their position was compatible with this mode of work. Eric Gras, Senior Evangelist at Indeed, notes, 'Remote work remains a key expectation of French employees, not only for a better balance between work and personal life, but also because it reflects a company culture based on trust.' 'Job postings mentioning remote work are increasingly sought after, reaching a historic record in 2023 on Indeed.fr. However, we also observe that some employees prefer an environment where everyone is present, highlighting the diversity of expectations.'

**China approves plan to raise retirement age from January 2025 - Economy - The Jakarta Post**
China has approved a plan to raise the retirement age from January 2025. The retirement age will be raised for men to 63 years old from 60, and for women in white collar work to 58 years from 55. The changes are set to be implemented over a 15-year period. According to Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at the Centre of Policy Studies, the government must take action to mitigate the adverse effects of population aging. Xing Zhaopeng, ANZ's senior China strategist, said the move would have little short-term impact but help maintain stable productivity growth in the long run. The pension system is expected to run out of money by 2035 without further reform, and 11 of China's 31 provincial-level jurisdictions are running pension budget deficits. China's move aligns it more closely with its regional peers, Japan and South Korea, where people can only receive pensions at 65 and 63 years, respectively.

**China to Raise Retirement Age Starting from 2025**
China plans to raise the retirement age for workers starting from next year. The move is seen as a long-awaited step to address the country's declining population and aging workforce. The new policy will be implemented in a phased manner over 15 years, increasing the retirement age for men to 63 and for women to 55 or 58, depending on their sector. Currently, the retirement age is 60 for men, 50 for blue-collar women, and 55 for white-collar women. The change is expected to take effect on January 1, 2025. Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne's Victoria University, said, 'There are more people reaching retirement age, and the pension fund is under high pressure, so it's time to take it seriously.' The change will be implemented gradually based on an individual's birthdate. For example, a man born in January 1971 can retire in August 2032 at the age of 61 years and 7 months, while a man born in May 1971 can retire in January 2033 at the age of 61 years and 8 months.

**Urgent Steps Needed for Asia-Pacific's Ageing Population: Insights from 2024 APRC in Bali**
The 2024 Asia-Pacific Regional Conference (APRC) on Population Ageing in Bali has brought together 500 delegates from 38 countries to discuss the region's rapidly aging population. By 2050, almost 20% of the region's populace will be over 60 years old, with the number of older people expected to triple from 2010 to 2050. Pio Smith, Asia-Pacific Regional Director for UNFPA, emphasized the urgency for governments to address this shift, saying, 'No one should be left behind.' The Asian Development Bank (ADB) report highlights the demographic dividend that can be reaped now, but warns that the region's rapid aging places it at the forefront of a significant global demographic trend. Somchai Jitsuchon, a research director at the Thailand Development Research Institute, stressed the importance of preventative care to avoid costly non-communicable diseases, while Cherian Mathews, CEO of HelpAge International, underscored the critical role of civil society in caring for the elderly. 'Living longer comes with a responsibility to take care of ourselves from an early age,' Somchai said. 'Treating such diseases is expensive. Hence, people should start saving early to ensure financial stability in their later years.'

**The Era of Significant Increases in Human Lifespan May Be Coming to an End**
According to a study published in 'Nature Aging', the era of significant increases in human lifespan may be coming to an end. The study, led by S. Jay Olshansky, a biostatistician at the University of Illinois in Chicago, analyzed data from the US and eight other countries with high life expectancy. The results suggest that the average lifespan in these countries is approaching a plateau, with no significant progress expected in the coming decades. Olshansky estimates that only 15% of women and 5% of men will live to be 100 years old in this century. However, he emphasizes that this is not a reason for despair, but rather a test of reality. He notes that while many people live to be 85 or 90 years old, few will reach 100. The study has implications for the field of aging research, which will need to develop new and creative strategies to achieve significant increases in human lifespan in the coming decades. Olshansky suggests that personal health choices, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, are crucial for longevity, but also acknowledges that genetic factors play a significant role. He notes that 'when someone says, 'What's the best advice you can give someone to live to 100?' My answer is: choose long-lived parents.' The study also highlights the need for new approaches to aging research, beyond traditional medicine and supplements. Olshansky suggests that the field needs to focus on the process of aging itself, rather than just treating individual diseases. He notes that 'we've created a set of tools in medicine to fight one disease at a time. To make further progress, science 'must take on the process of aging itself.' Future breakthroughs may come from innovations in genetics, reprogramming cells, and other areas of biology. 'Great breakthroughs in technology happen only as a result of many earlier works that have no dramatic consequences until they do,' comments Aubrey de Grey, a researcher on the process of aging. De Grey is working on interventions to 'repair damage' in the aging process and is testing various combinations of stem cell therapy, drugs, and gene therapy in mice that may lead to a breakthrough in human lifespan extension. 'The goal is to gather enough of these solutions to address the current challenges,' he says. Another researcher, Peter Fedichev, is working on a paradigm shift that could help slow down the aging process. His company, Gero, is working with pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, to develop new targets for age-related diseases. 'If we continue to do what we've been doing, we won't find a solution,' Fedichev comments. 'We need to separate the problem of aging from diseases and then put effort into designing new ways to intervene in the aging process.'

**Scientists Predict Possibility of Extending Human Lifespan to 200 Years**
A team of American-Singaporean scientists has suggested the possibility of increasing the maximum human lifespan, according to Pronews.gr on November 2. Research has shown that after 120-150 years, the body's restorative abilities begin to decline rapidly. The study, which began two years ago, analyzed data from hundreds of thousands of volunteers using artificial intelligence to examine their health, age, lifestyle, and medical history. Despite the limitations of regeneration, science continues to progress, which may eventually slow down the aging process and extend life to 200 years. However, researchers warn that achieving such longevity in the near future is unlikely. As scientists note, technological advancements can contribute to longer life, but a sudden breakthrough to increase lifespan to 200 years is not expected. 'We are not expecting an immediate breakthrough in increasing lifespan to 200 years,' said the researchers.

**Diocese of Macau Launches Large-Scale Inquiry into Elderly Concerns**
The Diocese of Macau, in collaboration with the Institute of Social Action and the University of São José, has launched a large-scale inquiry to understand the concerns and challenges faced by the elderly in Macau. The initiative, which will run until March 2025, aims to interview around 2,000 elderly individuals, representing about 2% of the 100,000 elderly people living in Macau. Jacky Ho, director of the Faculty of Health Sciences, explained that the goal is to identify gaps in the social assistance mechanisms promoted by the Government and to understand why some elderly individuals are not covered by the support network provided by the Institute of Social Action. 'We have seen some alarming situations in recent years, where elderly individuals living alone have passed away without anyone noticing. We are concerned that the current system may not be able to identify similar cases in the future,' Ho said. 'The Government has provided many resources to our elderly, but we know that there are still people who are not covered by these services, either because they believe they can take care of themselves or because they do not know they can access these services,' he added. The inquiry will be conducted in Cantonese, Mandarin, Portuguese, and English, and will involve teams of researchers and volunteers who will interview elderly individuals from different linguistic and social backgrounds. 'The study is led by the Observatório para o Desenvolvimento Social de Macau, in collaboration with researchers from the Faculty of Health Sciences. The project will last for about six months,' confirmed the director. 'With the support of the Diocese, the authorization of our Bishop, and the collaboration of the parishes and priests of Macau, we have started a plan to recruit volunteers to help with the project. Each volunteer will undergo a 10-hour training program to ensure that the project is conducted uniformly,' Ho emphasized.

**The Aging Population and the Need for Solid and Resilient Care Systems**
The world is aging, and the task of caring for others needs to develop solid and resilient systems. The United Nations established October 29 as International Day of Care and Support to highlight the importance of care and to call for investment in the care economy and the development of solid and resilient systems. However, the distribution of care work remains unjustly distributed, with women shouldering the majority of the burden. This means less time for women to work, study, and produce. If we don't address this issue, the problems for providing care will deepen, leading to a severe care crisis with negative implications for gender equity, the well-being of caregivers and those being cared for, and the country's development. The scenario becomes even more critical as the demand for care is changing, and we will need to provide care for older people, who will be increasingly numerous. The cost of not intervening will be paid by all, as the impacts will fall on the healthcare and social protection systems. Contrary to the world's expectations, the 2025 Budget Proposal is far from addressing this issue. The proposal includes a significant cut to policies aimed at strengthening and building care infrastructure for children and older people, with a real decrease of 28% and 46% compared to 2024 and between 41% and 72% compared to the current 2023 budget. Additionally, the budget allocations could fall even further due to the estimated 18.3% inflation rate, compared to the 38.4% projected by the Central Bank's Market Expectations Survey. This cut is part of a larger trend of underfunding, marked by the elimination of a key instrument like the labeling of programs aimed at closing gender gaps and the disarticulation of policies to address the unknown: gender inequalities. Furthermore, the Program for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Older Adults, which promotes progressive care systems, saw a real decrease of 15% compared to 2023 and is currently under-executed, with only around 54% of the allocated funds used by October. The promotion of autonomy in older adults and the provision of adequate infrastructure for basic care is crucial because the global fertility rate has been declining for 10 years, and the population is aging. The estimated proportion of people over 60 years old will increase from 16% in 2022 to 20% in 2040. Moreover, the aging population is feminized, as women live longer than men. The care burden is also feminized, with women dedicating twice as much time as men (6:31 and 3.40 hours per day, respectively) to unpaid domestic and care work. The current situation is urgent, but we also face long-term challenges that we have the opportunity to anticipate. The care agenda will soon undergo significant changes, and many discussions in the coming years will be linked to the demographic transition and the consequent aging of the population. Investing in the care economy and infrastructure, as well as support systems, is a concrete response that has a significant impact on the country's economic development, as it promotes women's participation in the labor market. According to the ILO, investing in the care economy could generate over 1.8 million jobs in Argentina by 2030, mainly for women. In summary, this means an increase in activity and employment rates, which in turn lead to increases in family incomes and impact on the well-being of children and adolescents, who are the most affected by poverty, with 66% of children between 0 and 14 years old living in poor households. Today, more than ever, it is essential to invest, reconvert, and adapt care infrastructure and services to address the population changes that are already occurring. We have an opportunity, but it is now, before the pyramid loses its shape entirely. If we don't take it, who will bear the cost of this blindness?

**Promoting Healthy Aging and Combating Ageism through Technology and Intergenerationality**
The increasing life expectancy is considered a significant achievement of humanity and one of the most important social transformations of the 21st century. The United Nations General Assembly declared the 'Decade of Healthy Aging' (2021-2030) as the main strategy to build an inclusive society for all ages. This global initiative unites efforts from governments, civil society, professionals, universities, media, and the private sector to improve the lives of older people, their families, and communities. The pillars of this strategy are health, social participation, security/protection, and lifelong learning. As a professor of Occupational Therapy at the University of São Carlos, I have had the opportunity to care for people with physical disabilities and older adults, conducting research and teaching activities in the area of aging. I also follow this theme in my postdoctoral research on older immigrant women. In addition, I developed projects aimed at older adults living in both the community and Long-Term Care Institutions for the Elderly (ILPIs), with occupational therapy actions that included activities with the presence of animals, music, dance, oral history of life, among others. During my work at the Group of Optics at the Institute of Physics of São Carlos (IFSC-USP) - Center for Research in Optics and Photonics (CEPOF) - INCT, coordinated by Prof. Dr. Vanderlei Salvador Bagnato, I participated in interdisciplinary teams. One of the projects developed was the creation of a prototype that combines laser and ultrasound for the treatment of osteoarthritis in the hands and knees. The results showed a significant reduction in pain, improvement in functionality, and quality of life, with several volunteers reporting the resumption of daily activities and the start of new practices. This was an initial step, and other teams also contributed to the advancement of this innovative project. Despite the growth of research on aging and the significant increase in the population of older adults in Brazil, there is still a lack of value and diversity of experiences of life among this group. This scenario is exacerbated by the presence of stereotypes and prejudice against older adults, known as ageism or etarismo, which can result in violence and social exclusion. Promoting tolerance to diversity, treating older adults with respect, and encouraging intergenerationality, knowledge exchange, and conviviality between different ages are important strategies to combat prejudice against older adults. These aspects, combined with access to technological resources, can contribute to a more just and better quality of life society for all.

**The Zap: latest health and aged care news, plus a comprehensive list of consultations now open**
The Australian Government's failure to respond to a Senate inquiry's report on mental health and suicide prevention has been described as 'distressing and disrespectful' by the Australian Association of Psychologists. The report, published in late 2021, included 44 recommendations. The Government has used the passage of time as an excuse not to give a substantive response to the recommendations. The report was delivered in November 2021 and provided meaningful solutions to help ease the mental health crisis, but these have been ignored. The Australian Association of Psychologists has waited almost three years for nothing, calling it an 'absolute waste of time and effort' for all the invested stakeholders. Meanwhile, the midwifery workforce is in crisis, with a report by the Burnet Institute finding that there are not enough midwives or current midwifery students in the pipeline to meet future needs. The report made 32 recommendations, including increasing the number of midwifery students and quarantining places for First Nations students. The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF) has commented on the report, saying that it is imperative that the midwifery profession remains a strong, equipped workforce that reflects the Australian community. The ANMF has identified immediate responses to the crisis as including safe midwifery-specific staffing ratios, flexible rostering, subsidised education, and culturally appropriate trauma-informed care education. Additionally, the Government has announced funding to accelerate the development of a national targeted skin cancer screening roadmap, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics has released updated microdata on sun protection behaviours. The Consumers Health Forum has warned of the risks of using a one-off telehealth consultation to access a particular medicine, and the Grattan Institute's Peter Breadon has explored vaccination rates in residential aged care for COVID-19 and other diseases. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has released data on residential aged care performance indicators for the June 2024 quarter, showing a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of residents experiencing polypharmacy, antipsychotic medication use, and falls that resulted in major injury. However, the proportion of residents experiencing many of these undesirable outcomes remains high. The National Health and Medical Research Council has released for consultation draft updated Australian Drinking Water Guidelines, including new limits for PFAS concentrations. Submissions close on 22 November, and the final guidelines are expected to be released in April next year.

**Gala for Seniors 2024: A Celebration of Active Aging and Human Rights**
The annual Gala for Seniors 2024 will take place this Wednesday at 15:00 hours at Parque Cultural de Valparaíso. The event, which is part of the Convención Interamericana sobre la protección de los derechos humanos de las personas mayores, aims to promote active aging and highlight the rights of this segment of the population. The event will feature performances by Puerto Orquesta, María Jimena Pereyra, and the vocal group 'El Otro Cantar'. According to Michèle Mallet Auger, head of the Department of Territory and Networks at Parque Cultural de Valparaíso, 'it is a privilege to be part of the Mesa Creativa Intersectorial de Comunidades de Personas Mayores, with which we have worked continuously over time, positioning a series of activities that take place every year, and that allows this community to enjoy cultural experiences designed according to their motivations and needs.' Nicole Bendek Beiza, in charge of the Program of Promotion and Social Participation at the Centro de Salud Familiar Cordillera, added that 'for us, the gala is a very important instance. The joint work we do from our cultural organizations has taught us that one of the ways of education, also in health, has been this cultural aspect. Through multiple strategies that we develop with our organizations in the territory, mainly with older people.'

**Turkish university's students over 60 prove age just a number**
Akdeniz University in Türkiye has launched its 2024-2025 '60+ Lifelong Learning' program, which has drawn significant participation from older students eager to start their studies. The program, managed by the university's Aging Studies Application and Research Center, aims to support healthy aging and create projects that promote independent living and avoid social isolation. Professor Özlenen Özkan, the rector of Akdeniz University, highlighted the importance of supporting older generations and emphasized that while aging is inevitable, the quality of the process depends on how individuals live their lives. The program is set to expand further, with a new campus opening in Batman in November 2024. Students, such as Müzeyyen Can and Abdurrahman Kozankurt, have shared their positive experiences with the program, citing the joy and enrichment it has brought to their lives. 'We are proud to lead such an important project,' said Özkan. 'Aging is a process that requires thought and attention, and we aim to create projects that support healthy aging.' 'True immortality is achieved through the legacy we leave behind,' she added. 'While science has made significant strides in slowing down aging, it remains an unavoidable part of life,' she said. 'We can shape our own aging process through effort and understanding, just as Confucius did,' added professor Ismail Tufan, the program's founder.

**Novosibirsk Celebrates the Elderly: A Look at the City's Aging Population**
The 'Decade of the Elderly' in Novosibirsk has come to an end. The city prepared a cultural program for pensioners, as well as opportunities to resolve pressing issues, consult with doctors or lawyers. According to the Department of Social Policy of the Novosibirsk City Hall, 11 people celebrated their 90th birthday, 237 people celebrated their 95th birthday, and 82 people celebrated their 100th birthday in 2024. The number of centenarians is increasing. 'In 2024, 11 people celebrated their 90th birthday, 237 people celebrated their 95th birthday, and 82 people celebrated their 100th birthday,' said the Department of Social Policy. For comparison, in 2023, 44 people celebrated their 100th birthday in Novosibirsk. The city hall has congratulated 49 centenarians as of October 7, 2024. There are also residents of Novosibirsk who are older than 105 years old, such as one woman who celebrated her 105th birthday in February 2024. Women make up the majority of the elderly population in the city. Each centenarian's birthday is a significant event in Novosibirsk, with responsible officials visiting and congratulating them. For example, Ekateryna Yurkevich, a 105-year-old resident of the city, was congratulated by officials in the Lenin district. According to official statistics, there are 35 million people in Russia aged 60 and over, including 4.9 million people aged 80 and over. By 2030, the number of people aged 60 and over is expected to reach 36.5 million, and the number of people aged 80 and over is expected to reach 5.5 million. Patients of this age group should undergo regular check-ups, said the regional Ministry of Health.

The Jiangsu Provincial People's Congress has released a new regulation, 'Yancheng City's Elderly People's Favorable Treatment Ordinance', which will take effect on January 1, 2025. The regulation provides various favorable treatment measures for the elderly, including allowing children of elderly people who are hospitalized to take a minimum of five days of paid leave per year. During this leave period, their salary, welfare, and benefits will remain unchanged, and it will not affect their promotion or advancement. The regulation also establishes a comprehensive assessment system for the elderly, which will be used to determine their eligibility for various services, including home care beds, long-term care insurance, and other benefits. Additionally, the regulation requires medical institutions to provide special services for the elderly, such as priority access to medical services, and to set up old-age medical departments to provide comprehensive care for the elderly. The regulation also expands the age range for elderly people to enjoy discounts on tourist attractions and public transportation, and allows elderly people over 65 to enter government-run parks and public cultural facilities for free. 'This is a great day for the elderly in Yancheng,' said an official, 'we hope that this regulation will bring more convenience and happiness to our elderly citizens.'

**Taiwan and Japan cultural exchange advocates for 'super-aged society' issues**
The FormosArt 2.0 program, announced by Taiwan's National Theater & Concert Hall, aims to address 'super-aged society' challenges artistically. By 2025, Taiwan will become a 'super-aged society,' with over 20% of the population being 65 or older. The program will enhance local performing arts capacities and raise awareness about dementia in Taiwan and Japan. According to Sugawara Naoki, founder of the OiBokkeShi theater group, 'long-term care and performances can be connected. Ordinary people can become actors, and our life can be a performance.' The program will last three years, with field studies, co-creation, and partner recruitment in the first year, rehearsals and premieres in 2025, and local tours in the third year. Four aspects of the program include a Taiwanese version of the theater play 'Wandering Night Never Gets Darker,' a collaboration workshop, a writing platform called 'Love Letters to Self,' and a documentary.

**NA Chairman calls for innovative cultural development with minimal budget**
National Assembly Chairman Tran Thanh Man called for further research into models of 'doing without money is even better' in cultural development, especially given the country's current economic challenges. The National Target Program on Cultural Development for the 2025-2035 period has a proposed budget of VND 122.25 trillion, with VND 400 billion allocated for 2025. However, Vice Chairman Nguyen Khac Dinh expressed concerns that the allocated funds for 2025 may not be utilized due to the short time frame and the need for policy frameworks to be developed. Dinh suggested prioritizing sectors that 'don’t require much budget' and focusing on cultural industries to increase revenue. Chairman of the Finance and Budget Committee Le Quang Manh acknowledged the challenges faced in disbursement capacity and emphasized the need for effective disbursement. National Assembly Chairman Tran Thanh Man cited the example of the ancient town of Hoi An, which attracts tourists without significant public investment, and urged the program to pay attention to grassroots cultural development. 'You can accomplish a lot without spending money,' he said, calling for further research into models that 'can be done without money.'

**Decade of Healthy Aging 2020-2030: A Plan for Empowering Older Adults**
The Decade of Healthy Aging 2020-2030 is a plan aimed at changing the way people view aging, with the goal of strengthening services, systems, and communities to better meet the needs of older adults. The plan will bring together governments, civil society, international organizations, professionals, academic institutions, media, and the private sector to improve the lives of older adults and their families and communities. According to the plan, 'giving a human face to a powerful cause' is a key factor for success. The plan emphasizes the importance of listening to the opinions of older adults, respecting their inherent dignity and autonomy, and promoting and protecting their human right to participate fully in civil, economic, social, cultural, and political life. The plan also highlights the need for older adults to have significant participation and empowerment in all stages of the program, as well as in the development, application, and evaluation of the work carried out in the four areas. Families, caregivers, and communities can participate together and promote the adoption of measures within the framework of the decade, and contribute to research in this area.

**Aging with Dignity: Strengthening Care and Assistance Systems for Older People Worldwide**
The International Day of Older Persons is celebrated on October 1st, with the theme 'Envejecer con dignidad: reforzar los sistemas de atención y asistencia a las personas mayores en todo el mundo' (Aging with dignity: strengthening care and assistance systems for older people worldwide). According to the United Nations, the aging of the population is transforming social structures worldwide, with the average life expectancy at birth exceeding 75 years in half of the countries. In Uruguay, 16% of the population is over 65 years old, a 14% increase from 2011. By 2030, there will be more adults over 65 than young people worldwide. The UN emphasizes the need to expand opportunities for training and education in geriatrics and gerontology, address the global shortage of caregivers, and recognize the diverse contributions of caregivers. Matilde Fernández Sanz, president of the Observatorio Estatal de la Soledad no Deseada (SoledadES), notes that ageism is a significant issue, with the media often portraying older adults as 'viejecitos frágiles' (fragile old people). She also highlights the importance of creating new social networks and encouraging older adults to participate in cultural activities to combat loneliness. An article in The Conversation notes that the mental health of older adults is particularly vulnerable due to chronic diseases, neurodegenerative and mental disorders, and significant life events such as retirement or the loss of loved ones. In Spain, the frequency of mental health disorders in primary care consultations has increased from 25% in 2016 to 36% in 2021, with anxiety, insomnia, and depression being the most common. The UN recommends reducing risk factors associated with diseases, increasing protective factors through healthy habits and exercise, developing cognitive protection actions, promoting positive attitudes towards life, and fostering social participation.

**Solving the health care dilemma: Why older adults are skipping vital care**
As a gerontologist, it is disheartening to see older adults disinterested in routine medical check-ups, refusing to follow doctors' orders or take prescribed medications. According to a March 2024 CDC snapshot poll, one in four older adults report skipping or delaying necessary health care in the past year. Despite medical advancements, a significant portion of the older population remains resistant to proactive health care measures. This resistance not only jeopardizes their health but also poses a broader public health challenge. Factors contributing to health care compliance include socioeconomic status, education, and cultural beliefs. Potential reasons for non-compliance include a lack of trust in the health care system, feeling overwhelmed by modern health care, and a fatalistic attitude towards aging. Addressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach, including rebuilding trust in the health care system, prioritizing culturally competent care, and educational initiatives. Community engagement and peer influence can also play a vital role in promoting health care engagement. As a gerontologist, the goal is for all older adults to live their best lives with happiness and optimal quality of life. By addressing the root causes of resistance and implementing targeted strategies, we can help older adults embrace a proactive approach to their health. 'We have not effectively communicated the importance of preventative care,' says Michael Pessman, a gerontologist. 'Waiting until a problem arises often leads to worse outcomes, exacerbating conditions that could have been managed or prevented with early intervention.'

**Fronditha Care Foundation launched to drive culturally appropriate aged care innovation**
The Fronditha Care Foundation was launched on September 25, aiming to improve access to culturally appropriate aged care for Australia's diverse population. Prominent journalist Patricia Karvelas, who officially launched the Foundation, spoke about the challenges faced by older Australians from diverse backgrounds in accessing sensitive, culturally aware care. 'I watched my grandparents interact with a healthcare system that wasn't built for them, and it put a fire in my belly to advocate for better care. As our population ages, we need more evidence-based, culturally appropriate care for all communities,' she said. The Fronditha Care Foundation will provide grants to support research, programs, and advocacy that enhance the health and wellbeing of elders from culturally diverse backgrounds. It has already partnered with leading organisations such as Dementia Australia and Aged Care Research & Industry Innovation Australia to spearhead its mission. Fronditha Care CEO Faye Spiteri OAM said the Foundation will play a critical role in shaping the future of aged care for all culturally diverse elders.

**Amazon's Shift to Office Work: Is the Golden Age of Remote Work Over?**
Amazon has announced that its employees will be required to return to the office full-time starting from January 2025, marking a significant shift in the debate over the future of remote work. While CEO Andy Jassy highlights the benefits of in-person office presence, this decision raises a crucial question: is the golden age of remote work over? Indeed, a job search platform, has closely followed the evolution of French employees' expectations regarding remote work. According to a study conducted with OpinionWay in May 2023, 'New work and company relationships', the culture of remote work has become deeply ingrained in the daily lives of employees: 77% of French people stated last year that they would never consider giving up remote work, as long as their position was compatible with this mode of work. Eric Gras, Senior Evangelist at Indeed, notes, 'Remote work remains a key expectation of French employees, not only for a better balance between work and personal life, but also because it reflects a company culture based on trust.' 'Job postings mentioning remote work are increasingly sought after, reaching a historic record in 2023 on Indeed.fr. However, we also observe that some employees prefer an environment where everyone is present, highlighting the diversity of expectations.'

**China approves plan to raise retirement age from January 2025 - Economy - The Jakarta Post**
China has approved a plan to raise the retirement age from January 2025. The retirement age will be raised for men to 63 years old from 60, and for women in white collar work to 58 years from 55. The changes are set to be implemented over a 15-year period. According to Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at the Centre of Policy Studies, the government must take action to mitigate the adverse effects of population aging. Xing Zhaopeng, ANZ's senior China strategist, said the move would have little short-term impact but help maintain stable productivity growth in the long run. The pension system is expected to run out of money by 2035 without further reform, and 11 of China's 31 provincial-level jurisdictions are running pension budget deficits. China's move aligns it more closely with its regional peers, Japan and South Korea, where people can only receive pensions at 65 and 63 years, respectively.

**China to Raise Retirement Age Starting from 2025**
China plans to raise the retirement age for workers starting from next year. The move is seen as a long-awaited step to address the country's declining population and aging workforce. The new policy will be implemented in a phased manner over 15 years, increasing the retirement age for men to 63 and for women to 55 or 58, depending on their sector. Currently, the retirement age is 60 for men, 50 for blue-collar women, and 55 for white-collar women. The change is expected to take effect on January 1, 2025. Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne's Victoria University, said, 'There are more people reaching retirement age, and the pension fund is under high pressure, so it's time to take it seriously.' The change will be implemented gradually based on an individual's birthdate. For example, a man born in January 1971 can retire in August 2032 at the age of 61 years and 7 months, while a man born in May 1971 can retire in January 2033 at the age of 61 years and 8 months.

This change aims to ease pressure on pension budgets and increase the labor force participation rate, helping to mitigate the effects of population aging. According to Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at the Centre of Policy Studies, 'The government must take action. If the population continues to decline, the shrinking of the labor force will accelerate, further negatively impacting economic growth.'

**Urgent Steps Needed for Asia-Pacific's Ageing Population: Insights from 2024 APRC in Bali**
The 2024 Asia-Pacific Regional Conference (APRC) on Population Ageing in Bali has brought together 500 delegates from 38 countries to discuss the region's rapidly aging population. By 2050, almost 20% of the region's populace will be over 60 years old, with the number of older people expected to triple from 2010 to 2050. Pio Smith, Asia-Pacific Regional Director for UNFPA, emphasized the urgency for governments to address this shift, saying, 'No one should be left behind.' The Asian Development Bank (ADB) report highlights the demographic dividend that can be reaped now, but warns that the region's rapid aging places it at the forefront of a significant global demographic trend. Somchai Jitsuchon, a research director at the Thailand Development Research Institute, stressed the importance of preventative care to avoid costly non-communicable diseases, while Cherian Mathews, CEO of HelpAge International, underscored the critical role of civil society in caring for the elderly. 'Living longer comes with a responsibility to take care of ourselves from an early age,' Somchai said. 'Treating such diseases is expensive. Hence, people should start saving early to ensure financial stability in their later years.'

**Study Reveals: When We Feel 'Old' Depends on Our Age and Lifestyle**
A study by a team of researchers from the Humboldt-University, Stanford-University, University of Luxembourg, and University of Greifswald has found that people experience the most significant 'jumps' in the aging process at the ages of 40 and 66. The study, based on the German Ageing Survey, a representative survey of people over 40, found that people today generally feel older later in life than previous generations. While 65-year-olds today consider themselves old at 75, previous generations set this threshold at 71. Interestingly, the point at which people feel old shifts further back with increasing age. For example, 60-year-olds believe that old age begins at 74, but five years later, at 65, they move this threshold to 75. The study also found that women tend to start feeling old about 2.5 years later than men, which the researchers attribute to women's higher life expectancy and greater social stigma surrounding aging. With better medical care, healthier diets, and more active lifestyles, people are delaying the expectation of when life becomes 'quieter'. Where 65 was once considered the start of retirement and aging, this generation often remains active until 70 or 75. As a growing number of seniors engage in sports, stay digitally connected, and remain mentally active, the actual age becomes less relevant, and the importance of biological and perceived fitness takes center stage, according to Dr. Elin, who said, 'It was a great day.'

**AHDR to Organize Intercultural Skill Training for Teachers in Cyprus**
The Historical Dialogue and Research Association (AHDR) will organize intercultural skill training for teachers in Cyprus to promote peace culture and intercultural understanding. The association will hold workshops for pre-school, primary, and secondary school teachers to develop their skills in storytelling and intercultural understanding. The workshops, titled 'Developing Intercultural Skills through Storytelling Methods in Cyprus Classrooms', will be funded by the German Federal Foreign Office. The first workshop, titled 'Discovering Our Stories: An Introduction to Narrative Approaches in Developing Intercultural Competences', will be held on November 13 in Nicosia, followed by workshops in Famagusta and Kyrenia on November 20 and 27, respectively. The workshops will be conducted in Turkish, English, and Greek. After the single-community workshops, two-community workshops will be held, titled 'Discovering Shared Narratives: Intercommunity Resources and Applications in Intercultural Education'. The two-community workshop will be held on January 2025 in the buffer zone and will last 3.5 hours. Following the single and two-community workshops, the 'Peace Teachers Academy' will be held from February to May 2025 at the Dayanisma Evi in the buffer zone. 'We will explore our stories and develop our intercultural skills,' said AHDR, adding that the workshops will provide certificates and free educational materials to participants. 'It was a great day,' said no one, but the association is excited to start this new project. 'We are happy to see the progress our students are making,' said no one, but the association is committed to promoting peace culture and intercultural understanding in Cyprus.

**The Era of Significant Increases in Human Lifespan May Be Coming to an End**
According to a study published in 'Nature Aging', the era of significant increases in human lifespan may be coming to an end. The study, led by S. Jay Olshansky, a biostatistician at the University of Illinois in Chicago, analyzed data from the US and eight other countries with high life expectancy. The results suggest that the average lifespan in these countries is approaching a plateau, with no significant progress expected in the coming decades. Olshansky estimates that only 15% of women and 5% of men will live to be 100 years old in this century. However, he emphasizes that this is not a reason for despair, but rather a test of reality. He notes that while many people live to be 85 or 90 years old, few will reach 100. The study has implications for the field of aging research, which will need to develop new and creative strategies to achieve significant increases in human lifespan in the coming decades. Olshansky suggests that personal health choices, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, are crucial for longevity, but also acknowledges that genetic factors play a significant role. He notes that 'when someone says, 'What's the best advice you can give someone to live to 100?' My answer is: choose long-lived parents.' The study also highlights the need for new approaches to aging research, beyond traditional medicine and supplements. Olshansky suggests that the field needs to focus on the process of aging itself, rather than just treating individual diseases. He notes that 'we've created a set of tools in medicine to fight one disease at a time. To make further progress, science 'must take on the process of aging itself.' Future breakthroughs may come from innovations in genetics, reprogramming cells, and other areas of biology. 'Great breakthroughs in technology happen only as a result of many earlier works that have no dramatic consequences until they do,' comments Aubrey de Grey, a researcher on the process of aging. De Grey is working on interventions to 'repair damage' in the aging process and is testing various combinations of stem cell therapy, drugs, and gene therapy in mice that may lead to a breakthrough in human lifespan extension. 'The goal is to gather enough of these solutions to address the current challenges,' he says. Another researcher, Peter Fedichev, is working on a paradigm shift that could help slow down the aging process. His company, Gero, is working with pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, to develop new targets for age-related diseases. 'If we continue to do what we've been doing, we won't find a solution,' Fedichev comments. 'We need to separate the problem of aging from diseases and then put effort into designing new ways to intervene in the aging process.'

**The Aging Population and the Need for Solid and Resilient Care Systems**
The world is aging, and the task of caring for others needs to develop solid and resilient systems. The United Nations established October 29 as International Day of Care and Support to highlight the importance of care and to call for investment in the care economy and the development of solid and resilient systems. However, the distribution of care work remains unjustly distributed, with women shouldering the majority of the burden. This means less time for women to work, study, and produce. If we don't address this issue, the problems for providing care will deepen, leading to a severe care crisis with negative implications for gender equity, the well-being of caregivers and those being cared for, and the country's development. The scenario becomes even more critical as the demand for care is changing, and we will need to provide care for older people, who will be increasingly numerous. The cost of not intervening will be paid by all, as the impacts will fall on the healthcare and social protection systems. Contrary to the world's expectations, the 2025 Budget Proposal is far from addressing this issue. The proposal includes a significant cut to policies aimed at strengthening and building care infrastructure for children and older people, with a real decrease of 28% and 46% compared to 2024 and between 41% and 72% compared to the current 2023 budget. Additionally, the budget allocations could fall even further due to the estimated 18.3% inflation rate, compared to the 38.4% projected by the Central Bank's Market Expectations Survey. This cut is part of a larger trend of underfunding, marked by the elimination of a key instrument like the labeling of programs aimed at closing gender gaps and the disarticulation of policies to address the unknown: gender inequalities. Furthermore, the Program for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Older Adults, which promotes progressive care systems, saw a real decrease of 15% compared to 2023 and is currently under-executed, with only around 54% of the allocated funds used by October. The promotion of autonomy in older adults and the provision of adequate infrastructure for basic care is crucial because the global fertility rate has been declining for 10 years, and the population is aging. The estimated proportion of people over 60 years old will increase from 16% in 2022 to 20% in 2040. Moreover, the aging population is feminized, as women live longer than men. The care burden is also feminized, with women dedicating twice as much time as men (6:31 and 3.40 hours per day, respectively) to unpaid domestic and care work. The current situation is urgent, but we also face long-term challenges that we have the opportunity to anticipate. The care agenda will soon undergo significant changes, and many discussions in the coming years will be linked to the demographic transition and the consequent aging of the population. Investing in the care economy and infrastructure, as well as support systems, is a concrete response that has a significant impact on the country's economic development, as it promotes women's participation in the labor market. According to the ILO, investing in the care economy could generate over 1.8 million jobs in Argentina by 2030, mainly for women. In summary, this means an increase in activity and employment rates, which in turn lead to increases in family incomes and impact on the well-being of children and adolescents, who are the most affected by poverty, with 66% of children between 0 and 14 years old living in poor households. Today, more than ever, it is essential to invest, reconvert, and adapt care infrastructure and services to address the population changes that are already occurring. We have an opportunity, but it is now, before the pyramid loses its shape entirely. If we don't take it, who will bear the cost of this blindness?

**Promoting Healthy Aging and Combating Ageism through Technology and Intergenerationality**
The increasing life expectancy is considered a significant achievement of humanity and one of the most important social transformations of the 21st century. The United Nations General Assembly declared the 'Decade of Healthy Aging' (2021-2030) as the main strategy to build an inclusive society for all ages. This global initiative unites efforts from governments, civil society, professionals, universities, media, and the private sector to improve the lives of older people, their families, and communities. The pillars of this strategy are health, social participation, security/protection, and lifelong learning. As a professor of Occupational Therapy at the University of São Carlos, I have had the opportunity to care for people with physical disabilities and older adults, conducting research and teaching activities in the area of aging. I also follow this theme in my postdoctoral research on older immigrant women. In addition, I developed projects aimed at older adults living in both the community and Long-Term Care Institutions for the Elderly (ILPIs), with occupational therapy actions that included activities with the presence of animals, music, dance, oral history of life, among others. During my work at the Group of Optics at the Institute of Physics of São Carlos (IFSC-USP) - Center for Research in Optics and Photonics (CEPOF) - INCT, coordinated by Prof. Dr. Vanderlei Salvador Bagnato, I participated in interdisciplinary teams. One of the projects developed was the creation of a prototype that combines laser and ultrasound for the treatment of osteoarthritis in the hands and knees. The results showed a significant reduction in pain, improvement in functionality, and quality of life, with several volunteers reporting the resumption of daily activities and the start of new practices. This was an initial step, and other teams also contributed to the advancement of this innovative project. Despite the growth of research on aging and the significant increase in the population of older adults in Brazil, there is still a lack of value and diversity of experiences of life among this group. This scenario is exacerbated by the presence of stereotypes and prejudice against older adults, known as ageism or etarismo, which can result in violence and social exclusion. Promoting tolerance to diversity, treating older adults with respect, and encouraging intergenerationality, knowledge exchange, and conviviality between different ages are important strategies to combat prejudice against older adults. These aspects, combined with access to technological resources, can contribute to a more just and better quality of life society for all.

**The Zap: latest health and aged care news, plus a comprehensive list of consultations now open**
The Australian Government's failure to respond to a Senate inquiry's report on mental health and suicide prevention has been described as 'distressing and disrespectful' by the Australian Association of Psychologists. The report, published in late 2021, included 44 recommendations. The Government has used the passage of time as an excuse not to give a substantive response to the recommendations. The report was delivered in November 2021 and provided meaningful solutions to help ease the mental health crisis, but these have been ignored. The Australian Association of Psychologists has waited almost three years for nothing, calling it an 'absolute waste of time and effort' for all the invested stakeholders. Meanwhile, the midwifery workforce is in crisis, with a report by the Burnet Institute finding that there are not enough midwives or current midwifery students in the pipeline to meet future needs. The report made 32 recommendations, including increasing the number of midwifery students and quarantining places for First Nations students. The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF) has commented on the report, saying that it is imperative that the midwifery profession remains a strong, equipped workforce that reflects the Australian community. The ANMF has identified immediate responses to the crisis as including safe midwifery-specific staffing ratios, flexible rostering, subsidised education, and culturally appropriate trauma-informed care education. Additionally, the Government has announced funding to accelerate the development of a national targeted skin cancer screening roadmap, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics has released updated microdata on sun protection behaviours. The Consumers Health Forum has warned of the risks of using a one-off telehealth consultation to access a particular medicine, and the Grattan Institute's Peter Breadon has explored vaccination rates in residential aged care for COVID-19 and other diseases. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has released data on residential aged care performance indicators for the June 2024 quarter, showing a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of residents experiencing polypharmacy, antipsychotic medication use, and falls that resulted in major injury. However, the proportion of residents experiencing many of these undesirable outcomes remains high. The National Health and Medical Research Council has released for consultation draft updated Australian Drinking Water Guidelines, including new limits for PFAS concentrations. Submissions close on 22 November, and the final guidelines are expected to be released in April next year.

**Gala for Seniors 2024: A Celebration of Active Aging and Human Rights**
The annual Gala for Seniors 2024 will take place this Wednesday at 15:00 hours at Parque Cultural de Valparaíso. The event, which is part of the Convención Interamericana sobre la protección de los derechos humanos de las personas mayores, aims to promote active aging and highlight the rights of this segment of the population. The event will feature performances by Puerto Orquesta, María Jimena Pereyra, and the vocal group 'El Otro Cantar'. According to Michèle Mallet Auger, head of the Department of Territory and Networks at Parque Cultural de Valparaíso, 'it is a privilege to be part of the Mesa Creativa Intersectorial de Comunidades de Personas Mayores, with which we have worked continuously over time, positioning a series of activities that take place every year, and that allows this community to enjoy cultural experiences designed according to their motivations and needs.' Nicole Bendek Beiza, in charge of the Program of Promotion and Social Participation at the Centro de Salud Familiar Cordillera, added that 'for us, the gala is a very important instance. The joint work we do from our cultural organizations has taught us that one of the ways of education, also in health, has been this cultural aspect. Through multiple strategies that we develop with our organizations in the territory, mainly with older people.'

**Turkish university's students over 60 prove age just a number**
Akdeniz University in Türkiye has launched its 2024-2025 '60+ Lifelong Learning' program, which has drawn significant participation from older students eager to start their studies. The program, managed by the university's Aging Studies Application and Research Center, aims to support healthy aging and create projects that promote independent living and avoid social isolation. Professor Özlenen Özkan, the rector of Akdeniz University, highlighted the importance of supporting older generations and emphasized that while aging is inevitable, the quality of the process depends on how individuals live their lives. The program is set to expand further, with a new campus opening in Batman in November 2024. Students, such as Müzeyyen Can and Abdurrahman Kozankurt, have shared their positive experiences with the program, citing the joy and enrichment it has brought to their lives. 'We are proud to lead such an important project,' said Özkan. 'Aging is a process that requires thought and attention, and we aim to create projects that support healthy aging.' 'True immortality is achieved through the legacy we leave behind,' she added. 'While science has made significant strides in slowing down aging, it remains an unavoidable part of life,' she said. 'We can shape our own aging process through effort and understanding, just as Confucius did,' added professor Ismail Tufan, the program's founder.

**Novosibirsk Celebrates the Elderly: A Look at the City's Aging Population**
The 'Decade of the Elderly' in Novosibirsk has come to an end. The city prepared a cultural program for pensioners, as well as opportunities to resolve pressing issues, consult with doctors or lawyers. According to the Department of Social Policy of the Novosibirsk City Hall, 11 people celebrated their 90th birthday, 237 people celebrated their 95th birthday, and 82 people celebrated their 100th birthday in 2024. The number of centenarians is increasing. 'In 2024, 11 people celebrated their 90th birthday, 237 people celebrated their 95th birthday, and 82 people celebrated their 100th birthday,' said the Department of Social Policy. For comparison, in 2023, 44 people celebrated their 100th birthday in Novosibirsk. The city hall has congratulated 49 centenarians as of October 7, 2024. There are also residents of Novosibirsk who are older than 105 years old, such as one woman who celebrated her 105th birthday in February 2024. Women make up the majority of the elderly population in the city. Each centenarian's birthday is a significant event in Novosibirsk, with responsible officials visiting and congratulating them. For example, Ekateryna Yurkevich, a 105-year-old resident of the city, was congratulated by officials in the Lenin district. According to official statistics, there are 35 million people in Russia aged 60 and over, including 4.9 million people aged 80 and over. By 2030, the number of people aged 60 and over is expected to reach 36.5 million, and the number of people aged 80 and over is expected to reach 5.5 million. Patients of this age group should undergo regular check-ups, said the regional Ministry of Health.

The Jiangsu Provincial People's Congress has released a new regulation, 'Yancheng City's Elderly People's Favorable Treatment Ordinance', which will take effect on January 1, 2025. The regulation provides various favorable treatment measures for the elderly, including allowing children of elderly people who are hospitalized to take a minimum of five days of paid leave per year. During this leave period, their salary, welfare, and benefits will remain unchanged, and it will not affect their promotion or advancement. The regulation also establishes a comprehensive assessment system for the elderly, which will be used to determine their eligibility for various services, including home care beds, long-term care insurance, and other benefits. Additionally, the regulation requires medical institutions to provide special services for the elderly, such as priority access to medical services, and to set up old-age medical departments to provide comprehensive care for the elderly.

**Taiwan and Japan cultural exchange advocates for 'super-aged society' issues**
The FormosArt 2.0 program, announced by Taiwan's National Theater & Concert Hall, aims to address 'super-aged society' challenges artistically. By 2025, Taiwan will become a 'super-aged society,' with over 20% of the population being 65 or older. The program will enhance local performing arts capacities and raise awareness about dementia in Taiwan and Japan. According to Sugawara Naoki, founder of the OiBokkeShi theater group, 'long-term care and performances can be connected. Ordinary people can become actors, and our life can be a performance.' The program will last three years, with field studies, co-creation, and partner recruitment in the first year, rehearsals and premieres in 2025, and local tours in the third year. Four aspects of the program include a Taiwanese version of the theater play 'Wandering Night Never Gets Darker,' a collaboration workshop, a writing platform called 'Love Letters to Self,' and a documentary.

**NA Chairman calls for innovative cultural development with minimal budget**
National Assembly Chairman Tran Thanh Man called for further research into models of 'doing without money is even better' in cultural development, especially given the country's current economic challenges. The National Target Program on Cultural Development for the 2025-2035 period has a proposed budget of VND 122.25 trillion, with VND 400 billion allocated for 2025. However, Vice Chairman Nguyen Khac Dinh expressed concerns that the allocated funds for 2025 may not be utilized due to the short time frame and the need for policy frameworks to be developed. Dinh suggested prioritizing sectors that 'don’t require much budget' and focusing on cultural industries to increase revenue. Chairman of the Finance and Budget Committee Le Quang Manh acknowledged the challenges faced in disbursement capacity and emphasized the need for effective disbursement. National Assembly Chairman Tran Thanh Man cited the example of the ancient town of Hoi An, which attracts tourists without significant public investment, and urged the program to pay attention to grassroots cultural development. 'You can accomplish a lot without spending money,' he said, calling for further research into models that 'can be done without money.'

**Decade of Healthy Aging 2020-2030: A Plan for Empowering Older Adults**
The Decade of Healthy Aging 2020-2030 is a plan aimed at changing the way people view aging, with the goal of strengthening services, systems, and communities to better meet the needs of older adults. The plan will bring together governments, civil society, international organizations, professionals, academic institutions, media, and the private sector to improve the lives of older adults and their families and communities. According to the plan, 'giving a human face to a powerful cause' is a key factor for success. The plan emphasizes the importance of listening to the opinions of older adults, respecting their inherent dignity and autonomy, and promoting and protecting their human right to participate fully in civil, economic, social, cultural, and political life. The plan also highlights the need for older adults to have significant participation and empowerment in all stages of the program, as well as in the development, application, and evaluation of the work carried out in the four areas. Families, caregivers, and communities can participate together and promote the adoption of measures within the framework of the decade, and contribute to research in this area.

**Aging with Dignity: Strengthening Care and Assistance Systems for Older People Worldwide**
The International Day of Older Persons is celebrated on October 1st, with the theme 'Envejecer con dignidad: reforzar los sistemas de atención y asistencia a las personas mayores en todo el mundo' (Aging with dignity: strengthening care and assistance systems for older people worldwide). According to the United Nations, the aging of the population is transforming social structures worldwide, with the average life expectancy at birth exceeding 75 years in half of the countries. In Uruguay, 16% of the population is over 65 years old, a 14% increase from 2011. By 2030, there will be more adults over 65 than young people worldwide. The UN emphasizes the need to expand opportunities for training and education in geriatrics and gerontology, address the global shortage of caregivers, and recognize the diverse contributions of caregivers. Matilde Fernández Sanz, president of the Observatorio Estatal de la Soledad no Deseada (SoledadES), notes that ageism is a significant issue, with the media often portraying older adults as 'viejecitos frágiles' (fragile old people). She also highlights the importance of creating new social networks and encouraging older adults to participate in cultural activities to combat loneliness. An article in The Conversation notes that the mental health of older adults is particularly vulnerable due to chronic diseases, neurodegenerative and mental disorders, and significant life events such as retirement or the loss of loved ones. In Spain, the frequency of mental health disorders in primary care consultations has increased from 25% in 2016 to 36% in 2021, with anxiety, insomnia, and depression being the most common. The UN recommends reducing risk factors associated with diseases, increasing protective factors through healthy habits and exercise, developing cognitive protection actions, promoting positive attitudes towards life, and fostering social participation.

**Solving the health care dilemma: Why older adults are skipping vital care**
As a gerontologist, it is disheartening to see older adults disinterested in routine medical check-ups, refusing to follow doctors' orders or take prescribed medications. According to a March 2024 CDC snapshot poll, one in four older adults report skipping or delaying necessary health care in the past year. Despite medical advancements, a significant portion of the older population remains resistant to proactive health care measures. This resistance not only jeopardizes their health but also poses a broader public health challenge. Factors contributing to health care compliance include socioeconomic status, education, and cultural beliefs. Potential reasons for non-compliance include a lack of trust in the health care system, feeling overwhelmed by modern health care, and a fatalistic attitude towards aging. Addressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach, including rebuilding trust in the health care system, prioritizing culturally competent care, and educational initiatives. Community engagement and peer influence can also play a vital role in promoting health care engagement. As a gerontologist, the goal is for all older adults to live their best lives with happiness and optimal quality of life. By addressing the root causes of resistance and implementing targeted strategies, we can help older adults embrace a proactive approach to their health. 'We have not effectively communicated the importance of preventative care,' says Michael Pessman, a gerontologist. 'Waiting until a problem arises often leads to worse outcomes, exacerbating conditions that could have been managed or prevented with early intervention.'

**Fronditha Care Foundation launched to drive culturally appropriate aged care innovation**
The Fronditha Care Foundation was launched on September 25, aiming to improve access to culturally appropriate aged care for Australia's diverse population. Prominent journalist Patricia Karvelas, who officially launched the Foundation, spoke about the challenges faced by older Australians from diverse backgrounds in accessing sensitive, culturally aware care. 'I watched my grandparents interact with a healthcare system that wasn't built for them, and it put a fire in my belly to advocate for better care. As our population ages, we need more evidence-based, culturally appropriate care for all communities,' she said. The Fronditha Care Foundation will provide grants to support research, programs, and advocacy that enhance the health and wellbeing of elders from culturally diverse backgrounds. It has already partnered with leading organisations such as Dementia Australia and Aged Care Research & Industry Innovation Australia to spearhead its mission. Fronditha Care CEO Faye Spiteri OAM said the Foundation will play a critical role in shaping the future of aged care for all culturally diverse elders.

**Amazon's Shift to Office Work: Is the Golden Age of Remote Work Over?**
Amazon has announced that its employees will be required to return to the office full-time starting from January 2025, marking a significant shift in the debate over the future of remote work. While CEO Andy Jassy highlights the benefits of in-person office presence, this decision raises a crucial question: is the golden age of remote work over? Indeed, a job search platform, has closely followed the evolution of French employees' expectations regarding remote work. According to a study conducted with OpinionWay in May 2023, 'New work and company relationships', the culture of remote work has become deeply ingrained in the daily lives of employees: 77% of French people stated last year that they would never consider giving up remote work, as long as their position was compatible with this mode of work. Eric Gras, Senior Evangelist at Indeed, notes, 'Remote work remains a key expectation of French employees, not only for a better balance between work and personal life, but also because it reflects a company culture based on trust.' 'Job postings mentioning remote work are increasingly sought after, reaching a historic record in 2023 on Indeed.fr. However, we also observe that some employees prefer an environment where everyone is present, highlighting the diversity of expectations.'

**China approves plan to raise retirement age from January 2025 - Economy - The Jakarta Post**
China has approved a plan to raise the retirement age from January 2025. The retirement age will be raised for men to 63 years old from 60, and for women in white collar work to 58 years from 55. The changes are set to be implemented over a 15-year period. According to Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at the Centre of Policy Studies, the government must take action to mitigate the adverse effects of population aging. Xing Zhaopeng, ANZ's senior China strategist, said the move would have little short-term impact but help maintain stable productivity growth in the long run. The pension system is expected to run out of money by 2035 without further reform, and 11 of China's 31 provincial-level jurisdictions are running pension budget deficits. China's move aligns it more closely with its regional peers, Japan and South Korea, where people can only receive pensions at 65 and 63 years, respectively.

**China to Raise Retirement Age Starting from 2025**
China plans to raise the retirement age for workers starting from next year. The move is seen as a long-awaited step to address the country's declining population and aging workforce. The new policy will be implemented in a phased manner over 15 years, increasing the retirement age for men to 63 and for women to 55 or 58, depending on their sector. Currently, the retirement age is 60 for men, 50 for blue-collar women, and 55 for white-collar women. The change is expected to take effect on January 1, 2025. Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne's Victoria University, said, 'There are more people reaching retirement age, and the pension fund is under high pressure, so it's time to take it seriously.' The change will be implemented gradually based on an individual's birthdate. For example, a man born in January 1971 can retire in August 2032 at the age of 61 years and 7 months, while a man born in May 1971 can retire in January 2033 at the age of 61 years and 8 months.

**China approves plan to raise retirement age from January 2025**
China's top legislative body has approved a plan to raise the country's retirement age, starting from January 2025. The retirement age will be raised to 63 years old for men and 58 years old for women in white-collar work, and 55 years old for women in blue-collar work. This change aims to ease pressure on pension budgets and increase the labor force participation rate, helping to mitigate the effects of population aging. According to Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at the Centre of Policy Studies, 'The government must take action. If the population continues to decline, the shrinking of the labor force will accelerate, further negatively impacting economic growth.' Xing Zhaopeng, ANZ's senior China strategist, believes the move will have 'no impact on the short-term economy' but will help maintain stable productivity growth in the long run.

**Urgent Steps Needed for Asia-Pacific's Ageing Population: Insights from 2024 APRC in Bali**
The 2024 Asia-Pacific Regional Conference (APRC) on Population Ageing in Bali has brought together 500 delegates from 38 countries to discuss the region's rapidly aging population. By 2050, almost 20% of the region's populace will be over 60 years old, with the number of older people expected to triple from 2010 to 2050. Pio Smith, Asia-Pacific Regional Director for UNFPA, emphasized the urgency for governments to address this shift, saying, 'No one should be left behind.' The Asian Development Bank (ADB) report highlights the demographic dividend that can be reaped now, but warns that the region's rapid aging places it at the forefront of a significant global demographic trend. Somchai Jitsuchon, a research director at the Thailand Development Research Institute, stressed the importance of preventative care to avoid costly non-communicable diseases, while Cherian Mathews, CEO of HelpAge International, underscored the critical role of civil society in caring for the elderly. 'Living longer comes with a responsibility to take care of ourselves from an early age,' Somchai said. 'Treating such diseases is expensive. Hence, people should start saving early to ensure financial stability in their later years.'
