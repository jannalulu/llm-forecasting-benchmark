**US Presidential Election 2024: Trump vs. Harris - Who Will Win?**
The US presidential election is heating up between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. According to recent polls, Harris maintains a slight lead over Trump, but the difference is minimal, and the outcome will depend on the key 'swing states'. In these states, the competition is fierce, with both candidates alternating in the lead depending on the survey and methodology used. It's essential to stay informed about the results and who is leading the election in the US 2024 so far. It's worth noting that the general elections in November this year are indirect, where US voters choose a group of Electoral College members, who then directly elect the president and vice president. If no candidate reaches the required votes, it's up to the US Congress to determine the new president, although these authorities don't always base their decision on popular will. Certain states play a crucial role in this final decision.

**US Presidential Elections: 60 Million Have Already Voted**
With the US presidential elections just five days away, the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is neck and neck, with both candidates competing in key states like Nevada and Arizona. The results in the southern parts of Georgia and North Carolina are also still uncertain, according to new CNN polls. In the US electoral system, voters do not directly elect the president, but rather the 538 members of the electoral college. The winner will be determined by the candidate who receives at least 270 electoral votes, which will be cast by the electors on December 17. The votes will be counted on January 6, 2025, and the new president will be inaugurated on January 20. The US electoral system is decentralized, with each state having its own election laws. Early voting is an option for voters, allowing them to cast their ballots before November 5. Over 60 million voters have already cast their ballots in 47 states and the District of Columbia, where the capital Washington is located, according to CNN. This represents about 38% of the approximately 158 million votes cast in 2020. Ten states have already surpassed 50% of the total votes from four years ago, led by Georgia, where over two-thirds of the votes have already been cast. As said by CNN, 'It's a significant turnout, especially considering it's just five days before the election.'

**Kamala Harris Delivers Scathing Closing Argument Against Donald Trump**
In a symbolic location, with the columns of the White House lit up in the night of Washington, Kamala Harris delivered her 'closing argument' against Donald Trump on October 29, 2024, one week before the November 5 election. The vice-president accused Trump of seeking 'unlimited power' and opposing her vision for 'a future full of promises'. Harris said, 'This election is 'the most important vote of your life', a choice between 'a country anchored in freedom for every American or one led by chaos and division'. 'We know who Donald Trump is,' she continued. 'He's the person who stood here, almost four years ago, and sent an armed mob to the Capitol to overturn the voice of the people in a free and fair election.' Harris described Trump as 'an unstable candidate, obsessed with vengeance, consumed by resentment, and seeking unlimited power' who wants 'to use the army against American citizens simply because they disagree with him, people he calls 'the enemy within'.' She contrasted this with her own 'to-do list' of priorities if she becomes president on January 20, 2025, including lowering the cost of living by 'cutting taxes for workers and the middle class' and passing a law against 'excessive price increases for food products'. Harris also promised credits for early childhood education and aid for first-time homebuyers.

**Election 2024 Latest: With 1 week to go, Harris speaks in Washington as Trump stumps in Pennsylvania**
Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her campaign's 'closing argument' in Washington, D.C., one week before the 2024 election. Harris emphasized the importance of the election, saying that voters will have the chance to make a decision that directly impacts their lives and the future of the country. She also attacked former President Donald Trump's competency on the international stage, saying that world leaders think he is an easy mark. Harris pledged to 'restore' abortion rights and to work every day to build consensus and reach compromise to get things done. Trump responded to Harris' speech, calling it 'backward-looking' and saying that Harris is lying, name-calling, and clinging to the past. Trump also claimed that the Harris campaign had bused people to Washington for her rally. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden said that he hopes to 'keep Donald Trump out of the White House' and praised Harris for her efforts to win over Republicans and former Trump supporters. Harris took the stage in Washington, surrounded by American flags and signs that read 'Freedom' in block letters, and delivered a speech that was a direct contrast to the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. She emphasized the importance of unity and said that 'our democracy doesn't require us to agree on everything.' Harris also spoke about her plans to address issues such as immigration and the economy, and said that she will be at Howard University on election night if elected.

**Harris to give 'closing argument' in remarks on DC's Ellipse**
Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver her 'closing argument' to the nation at a rally on Washington D.C.'s Ellipse on Tuesday evening, just days before the election. Harris will stand in front of the White House and outline her agenda, emphasizing the importance of 'turning the page' and improving the lives of Americans. The event is expected to draw around 20,000 people, up from the initial estimate of 7,500. Harris has been emphasizing the significance of the location, which is the same place where Donald Trump spoke before the January 6, 2021 Capitol attacks. Harris said, 'I think it is very important for the American people to see and think about who will be occupying that space on January 20.' She also accused Trump of being 'full of grievances' and using 'dark language' that is about 'retribution and revenge.' Harris said, 'It is either going to be that, or it'll be me there, focused on my to-do list, focused on the American people, and getting through that list of goals and plans to improve the lives of the American people.'

Democrat candidate Kamala Harris has warned that they are prepared for the possibility of Donald Trump declaring victory before all votes are counted in the upcoming US presidential election. Harris stated, 'We will be focused on the election night and the days that follow, and we will have our resources, expertise, and focus on that. This is a person, Donald Trump, who has tried to undermine the free and fair election, has incited a violent mob to attack the United States Capitol, and still refuses to accept the will of the people. 140 law enforcement officers were attacked, and some were killed. This is a serious issue. The American people are facing a very serious decision about the future of our country.' Harris also accused Trump of trying to undermine the 2020 presidential election results and inciting violence on January 6, 2021, at the US Capitol.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Latest News on Trump and Kamala Harris**
The US presidential election is just a few days away, and the anticipation is building as to who will win. According to national polls, Vice President Kamala Harris has a slight lead over Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump. However, experts note that national polls may not reflect the final result, as the US electoral system is indirect. In most states, the winner takes all the electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, where the votes are allocated proportionally. To win the presidency, a candidate needs to secure more than 270 electoral votes. The final count will take place on January 6, 2025, and the winner will be sworn in as President on January 20, 2025.

**US election 2024: When will we know the result as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump face off in November 5 poll**
The 2024 US presidential election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is expected to be a contentious one, with Trump claiming that only a 'fair' decision will be respected. The election will take place on November 5, but the result may not be clear for several days or even weeks due to recounts, early voting, and mail-in ballots. Republican-led legislatures have moved to restrict voters' choice and contest the integrity of absentee ballots, leading to a bigger chance of challenges being heard and upheld. Further judicial hearings are likely after November 5, with both parties preparing a rearguard of lawyers. The Electoral College is scheduled to convene on December 17 to certify the result, and the declaration of the result in Congress on January 6, 2025, is also a key flashpoint. Trump has threatened to turn the armed forces on Democrats who object in the event of him winning, but much of this will likely be empty bluster. It may take a while to play out before the next president is inaugurated on January 20, 2025.

**2024 United States Presidential Election: Key Facts and Dates**
The 2024 United States presidential election is approaching, with voters set to choose between incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. The election will take place on November 5, 2024, and will determine not only the next President of the United States but also the composition of the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate. The President of the United States serves as both head of government and head of state, but the Congress plays a crucial role in the legislative process and can even remove the President from office. The election will also determine the governors of 11 states and two territories. To be eligible for the presidency, a candidate must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years old, and a resident of the country for at least 14 years. The President is limited to two terms, which can be consecutive or non-consecutive. The winner of the election will be determined by the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors chosen by each state. The President-elect will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, in a ceremony at the Capitol Building. If no candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes, the House of Representatives will choose the President, and the Senate will choose the Vice President. This has only happened twice in U.S. history. 'The election is a crucial moment for the country, and it's essential to ensure that every vote is counted and every voice is heard,' said a spokesperson for the Democratic Party. 'We're confident that our candidate will win, but we're also prepared for any scenario,' added a Republican Party spokesperson.

**Guess Who Certifies Trump’s Election**
In January 2025, Vice-President Kamala Harris will be responsible for certifying Donald Trump's election. However, Harris has previously described Trump as 'fascist to the core,' 'unfit to serve,' and 'increasingly unstable and unhinged.' This rhetoric has already led to multiple attempts on Trump's life, and some speculate that Harris may refuse to acknowledge the will of the people in order to safeguard what she considers 'Our Democracy.' The Biden/Harris regime has also expressed a desire to throw Trump in prison if he loses the election. Meanwhile, a recent poll shows Trump flipping Wisconsin against Harris, and some are concerned that the Party of the Liberal Establishment may resort to cheating to maintain their control.

**What to Expect from the US Presidential Election**
The US presidential election is approaching, with the majority of states allowing early voting or mail-in voting. Although the polls predict a close election, there may be unexpected developments until election day on November 5. The Democratic campaign, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, and the Republican campaign, led by former President Donald Trump, will focus on key battleground states. It is essential for Americans to register to vote as soon as possible, with 23 states and Washington, DC allowing same-day registration. The election process will continue beyond election day, with potential lawsuits and recounts in some states. The outcome may not be known on election day due to the increase in mail-in voting. After the election, the Electoral College process will begin, and the new Congress will take office on January 3, 2025. In the unlikely event of a tie in the Electoral College, the new Congress will decide the election. Harris will preside over the vote count on January 6, 2025, and the next President will take the oath of office on January 20, 2025.

The United States presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024, with over 240 million eligible voters. The election process will conclude on January 20, 2025, when the winner will be formally inaugurated on the Capitol steps. Citizens can exercise their right to vote by mail, with over 65 million votes cast through this system in 2020.

To win, a candidate must secure at least 270 electoral votes in a session on December 17. The Electoral College results are recorded on a 'certificate of vote' and sent to Congress and the National Archives. On January 6, Congress receives and counts the electoral votes, with Vice President Kamala Harris presiding over the joint session. The winner will be inaugurated as the 47th president of the United States on January 20, 2025, with a formal oath-taking ceremony before the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

**US Elections: Key Dates from Voting to Presidential Inauguration**
On November 5, American citizens will exercise their right to vote, although the president will not begin their term until January 20. The election process is based on a series of phases that have remained largely unchanged since the country's independence. The final stage will be on January 20, 2025, when the inauguration will take place on the Capitol's steps. The election is not a coincidence, as it is always held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of leap years. The promoters of this date chose November to facilitate transportation and avoid winter months, and added a condition to avoid coinciding with the holiday on November 1. The citizens do not directly elect the president on November 5, but rather the 538 members of the Electoral Council, who will designate the future occupant of the White House based on the population of each state. To ensure victory, a candidate needs to surpass the threshold of 270 votes in a session that will take place on December 17. The Electoral Council's result is recorded on a 'certificate of vote' and sent to Congress and the National Archives. On January 6, Congress receives these electoral votes, counts them, and certifies them in a joint session led by Vice President Kamala Harris. The winner of the election will be inaugurated as the 47th president of the United States on January 20, 2025, with a formal beginning of their term with an oath before the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

**2020 is back on the 2024 campaign trail**
With 30 days left before the 2024 election, Vice President Kamala Harris and her allies are focusing on former President Donald Trump's actions on January 6, 2021, and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Harris' campaign is using the issue to remind voters of Trump's 'attempt to stay in power by unraveling the foundations of our republic,' as former Rep. Liz Cheney put it. Cheney said, 'Our republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before — a former president who attempted to stay in power by refusing to accept the lawful results confirmed by dozens of courts of the 2020 election.' Harris' campaign is also airing ads featuring local couples who previously supported Trump but now oppose him due to his actions on January 6. Trump's campaign has blamed the media for the renewed focus on January 6, but polls show that voters are concerned about the issue, with 89% saying 'preserving democracy' is a factor in their vote. A recent poll found that 95% of voters say the economy is a factor in their vote, but 89% also say preserving democracy is a factor, with 64% saying it would be a 'deciding factor' in their decision.

**US Presidential Elections 2024: All you need to know about 2024 elections in the United States**
With less than two months remaining until Election Day, the recent debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump offered a critical insight into the contentious presidential race. Harris presented a strong case against Trump, confronting him on issues such as abortion, immigration, and the state of American democracy. The two candidates have starkly differing visions for the country. The election is scheduled for Tuesday, November 5, 2024, and the winning candidate will hold office for a four-year term starting in January 2025. Key issues dominating the 2024 election include the economy, healthcare, climate change, immigration, national security, and social justice. The Democrats are considered the more liberal party, advocating for civil rights, a broad social safety net, and initiatives to combat climate change. The Republicans, on the other hand, represent conservative values, promoting lower taxes, government reduction, gun rights, and stricter immigration and abortion policies. Harris's nomination for the upcoming November elections would be historic, mirroring her achievement in 2020 when she became the first woman, Black woman, and person of South Asian descent to serve as Vice President of the United States. Harris is recognized for her advocacy on issues such as criminal justice reform, healthcare, and immigration. Trump, on the other hand, is an American businessman, television personality, and politician who served as the 45th president of the United States from January 20, 2017, to January 20, 2021. For the 2024 elections, he has secured the Republican nomination.

**Presidential historian: 'Kamala Harris will be the next president'**
Presidential historian Thomas Whalen believes that Kamala Harris will be the next President of the United States, stating that she 'knocked it out of the park' in the recent debate against Donald Trump. Whalen praised Harris' direct engagement on issues like climate change, which resonated particularly well with younger voters. In contrast, Trump appeared to 'unravel' by the end of the debate, ignoring questions and making 'crazy uncle talk' about executing babies and eating dogs. Whalen expressed concern over Trump's continued rhetoric about election fraud, warning that it could increase the likelihood of violence in January 2025.

The 2024 US presidential election is coming to an end, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump's futures to be decided in the early hours of Tuesday to Wednesday. The outcome is uncertain, with polls showing a close tie between the two candidates, and the results may not be finalized until the weekend due to a potential recount in Arizona and Nevada.

**The 2024 US Presidential Election: When and at What Time Will We Know the Winner?**
The 2024 United States presidential election is approaching, with millions of votes still undecided. On one side is Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, while the other is Donald Trump, the former president. After Joe Biden announced he would not continue his campaign, Harris has gained more supporters, making the election more balanced. However, the question remains: when and at what time will we know the winner of the US election? To register and vote in the 2024 US election on November 5, citizens must meet certain requirements. In the 2016 election, the result was announced at 2:30 am the next day, between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. In the 2020 election, the result was not announced until four days later, between Biden and Trump. This time, the gap between Harris and Trump has narrowed in recent weeks, leaving the outcome uncertain. Will we know the winner in hours or days? Kamala Harris, born and raised in San Francisco, California, has a background in public service. She studied law at the University of California and began her career as a district attorney in Alameda County. Harris' rise to prominence was steady, and in 2004, she became the district attorney of San Francisco, a position she held until 2010. She then became the Attorney General of California, becoming the first woman and African American to hold the position. Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, is a figure who has generated much debate, but continues to influence the country's politics. Born in New York in 1946, Trump is the fourth of five children from a family of real estate entrepreneurs. His father, a real estate mogul, inspired him to join the family business. Before his political career, Trump was a notable entrepreneur and television personality, known for his show 'The Apprentice,' where he coined the famous phrase 'You're fired.'

**US Presidential Elections: 60 Million Have Already Voted**
With the US presidential elections just five days away, the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is neck and neck, with both candidates competing in key states like Nevada and Arizona. The results in the southern parts of Georgia and North Carolina are also still uncertain, according to new CNN polls. In the US electoral system, voters do not directly elect the president, but rather the 538 members of the electoral college. The winner will be determined by the candidate who receives at least 270 electoral votes, which will be cast by the electors on December 17. The votes will be counted on January 6, 2025, and the new president will be inaugurated on January 20. The US electoral system is decentralized, with each state having its own election laws. Early voting is an option for voters, allowing them to cast their ballots before November 5. Over 60 million voters have already cast their ballots in 47 states and the District of Columbia, where the capital Washington is located, according to CNN. This represents about 38% of the approximately 158 million votes cast in 2020. Ten states have already surpassed 50% of the total votes from four years ago, led by Georgia, where over two-thirds of the votes have already been cast. As said by CNN, 'It's a significant turnout, especially considering it's just five days before the election.'

**Kamala Harris Delivers Scathing Closing Argument Against Donald Trump**
In a symbolic location, with the columns of the White House lit up in the night of Washington, Kamala Harris delivered her 'closing argument' against Donald Trump on October 29, 2024, one week before the November 5 election. The vice-president accused Trump of seeking 'unlimited power' and opposing her vision for 'a future full of promises'. Harris said, 'This election is 'the most important vote of your life', a choice between 'a country anchored in freedom for every American or one led by chaos and division'. 'We know who Donald Trump is,' she continued. 'He's the person who stood here, almost four years ago, and sent an armed mob to the Capitol to overturn the voice of the people in a free and fair election.' Harris described Trump as 'an unstable candidate, obsessed with vengeance, consumed by resentment, and seeking unlimited power' who wants 'to use the army against American citizens simply because they disagree with him, people he calls 'the enemy within'.' She contrasted this with her own 'to-do list' of priorities if she becomes president on January 20, 2025, including lowering the cost of living by 'cutting taxes for workers and the middle class' and passing a law against 'excessive price increases for food products'. Harris also promised credits for early childhood education and aid for first-time homebuyers.

**Election 2024 Latest: With 1 week to go, Harris speaks in Washington as Trump stumps in Pennsylvania**
Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her campaign's 'closing argument' in Washington, D.C., one week before the 2024 election. Harris emphasized the importance of the election, saying that voters will have the chance to make a decision that directly impacts their lives and the future of the country. She also attacked former President Donald Trump's competency on the international stage, saying that world leaders think he is an easy mark. Harris pledged to 'restore' abortion rights and to work every day to build consensus and reach compromise to get things done. Trump responded to Harris' speech, calling it 'backward-looking' and saying that Harris is lying, name-calling, and clinging to the past. Trump also claimed that the Harris campaign had bused people to Washington for her rally. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden said that he hopes to 'keep Donald Trump out of the White House' and praised Harris for her efforts to win over Republicans and former Trump supporters. Harris took the stage in Washington, surrounded by American flags and signs that read 'Freedom' in block letters, and delivered a speech that was a direct contrast to the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. She emphasized the importance of unity and said that 'our democracy doesn't require us to agree on everything.' Harris also spoke about her plans to address issues such as immigration and the economy, and said that she will be at Howard University on election night if elected.

**Harris to give 'closing argument' in remarks on DC's Ellipse**
Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver her 'closing argument' to the nation at a rally on Washington D.C.'s Ellipse on Tuesday evening, just days before the election. Harris will stand in front of the White House and outline her agenda, emphasizing the importance of 'turning the page' and improving the lives of Americans. The event is expected to draw around 20,000 people, up from the initial estimate of 7,500. Harris has been emphasizing the significance of the location, which is the same place where Donald Trump spoke before the January 6, 2021 Capitol attacks. Harris said, 'I think it is very important for the American people to see and think about who will be occupying that space on January 20.' She also accused Trump of being 'full of grievances' and using 'dark language' that is about 'retribution and revenge.' Harris said, 'It is either going to be that, or it'll be me there, focused on my to-do list, focused on the American people, and getting through that list of goals and plans to improve the lives of the American people.'

**Harris Warns of Trump's Early Victory Declaration: 'Preparation for a Threat to Democracy'**
Democrat candidate Kamala Harris has warned that they are prepared for the possibility of Donald Trump declaring victory before all votes are counted in the upcoming US presidential election. Harris stated, 'We will be focused on the election night and the days that follow, and we will have our resources, expertise, and focus on that. This is a person, Donald Trump, who has tried to undermine the free and fair election, has incited a violent mob to attack the United States Capitol, and still refuses to accept the will of the people. 140 law enforcement officers were attacked, and some were killed. This is a serious issue. The American people are facing a very serious decision about the future of our country.' Harris also accused Trump of trying to undermine the 2020 presidential election results and inciting violence on January 6, 2021, at the US Capitol. When asked if America is ready for a female and diverse president, Harris replied, 'We will see.'

**US Presidential Election 2024: Latest News on Trump and Kamala Harris**
The US presidential election is just a few days away, and the anticipation is building as to who will win. According to national polls, Vice President Kamala Harris has a slight lead over Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump. However, experts note that national polls may not reflect the final result, as the US electoral system is indirect. In most states, the winner takes all the electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, where the votes are allocated proportionally. To win the presidency, a candidate needs to secure more than 270 electoral votes. The final count will take place on January 6, 2025, and the winner will be sworn in as President on January 20, 2025.

**US election 2024: When will we know the result as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump face off in November 5 poll**
The 2024 US presidential election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is expected to be a contentious one, with Trump claiming that only a 'fair' decision will be respected. The election will take place on November 5, but the result may not be clear for several days or even weeks due to recounts, early voting, and mail-in ballots. Republican-led legislatures have moved to restrict voters' choice and contest the integrity of absentee ballots, leading to a bigger chance of challenges being heard and upheld. Further judicial hearings are likely after November 5, with both parties preparing a rearguard of lawyers. The Electoral College is scheduled to convene on December 17 to certify the result, and the declaration of the result in Congress on January 6, 2025, is also a key flashpoint. Trump has threatened to turn the armed forces on Democrats who object in the event of him winning, but much of this will likely be empty bluster. It may take a while to play out before the next president is inaugurated on January 20, 2025.

**2024 United States Presidential Election: Key Facts and Dates**
The 2024 United States presidential election is approaching, with voters set to choose between incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. The election will take place on November 5, 2024, and will determine not only the next President of the United States but also the composition of the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate. The President of the United States serves as both head of government and head of state, but the Congress plays a crucial role in the legislative process and can even remove the President from office. The election will also determine the governors of 11 states and two territories. To be eligible for the presidency, a candidate must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years old, and a resident of the country for at least 14 years. The President is limited to two terms, which can be consecutive or non-consecutive. The winner of the election will be determined by the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors chosen by each state. The President-elect will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, in a ceremony at the Capitol Building. If no candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes, the House of Representatives will choose the President, and the Senate will choose the Vice President. This has only happened twice in U.S. history. 'The election is a crucial moment for the country, and it's essential to ensure that every vote is counted and every voice is heard,' said a spokesperson for the Democratic Party. 'We're confident that our candidate will win, but we're also prepared for any scenario,' added a Republican Party spokesperson.

**Guess Who Certifies Trump’s Election**
In January 2025, Vice-President Kamala Harris will be responsible for certifying Donald Trump's election. However, Harris has previously described Trump as 'fascist to the core,' 'unfit to serve,' and 'increasingly unstable and unhinged.' This rhetoric has already led to multiple attempts on Trump's life, and some speculate that Harris may refuse to acknowledge the will of the people in order to safeguard what she considers 'Our Democracy.' The Biden/Harris regime has also expressed a desire to throw Trump in prison if he loses the election. Meanwhile, a recent poll shows Trump flipping Wisconsin against Harris, and some are concerned that the Party of the Liberal Establishment may resort to cheating to maintain their control.

**What to Expect from the US Presidential Election**
The US presidential election is approaching, with the majority of states allowing early voting or mail-in voting. Although the polls predict a close election, there may be unexpected developments until election day on November 5. The Democratic campaign, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, and the Republican campaign, led by former President Donald Trump, will focus on key battleground states. It is essential for Americans to register to vote as soon as possible, with 23 states and Washington, DC allowing same-day registration. The election process will continue beyond election day, with potential lawsuits and recounts in some states. The outcome may not be known on election day due to the increase in mail-in voting. After the election, the Electoral College process will begin, and the new Congress will take office on January 3, 2025. In the unlikely event of a tie in the Electoral College, the new Congress will decide the election. Harris will preside over the vote count on January 6, 2025, and the next President will take the oath of office on January 20, 2025.

**Key Dates for the US Presidential Election: November 5 to January 20**
The United States presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024, with over 240 million eligible voters. The election process will conclude on January 20, 2025, when the winner will be formally inaugurated on the Capitol steps. Citizens can exercise their right to vote by mail, with over 65 million votes cast through this system in 2020.

To win, a candidate must secure at least 270 electoral votes in a session on December 17. The Electoral College results are recorded on a 'certificate of vote' and sent to Congress and the National Archives. On January 6, Congress receives and counts the electoral votes, with Vice President Kamala Harris presiding over the joint session. The winner will be inaugurated as the 47th president of the United States on January 20, 2025, with a formal oath-taking ceremony before the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

**US Elections: Key Dates from Voting to Presidential Inauguration**
On November 5, American citizens will exercise their right to vote, although the president will not begin their term until January 20. The election process is based on a series of phases that have remained largely unchanged since the country's independence. The final stage will be on January 20, 2025, when the inauguration will take place on the Capitol's steps. The election is not a coincidence, as it is always held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of leap years. The promoters of this date chose November to facilitate transportation and avoid winter months, and added a condition to avoid coinciding with the holiday on November 1. The citizens do not directly elect the president on November 5, but rather the 538 members of the Electoral Council, who will designate the future occupant of the White House based on the population of each state. To ensure victory, a candidate needs to surpass the threshold of 270 votes in a session that will take place on December 17. The Electoral Council's result is recorded on a 'certificate of vote' and sent to Congress and the National Archives. On January 6, Congress receives these electoral votes, counts them, and certifies them in a joint session led by Vice President Kamala Harris. The winner of the election will be inaugurated as the 47th president of the United States on January 20, 2025, with a formal beginning of their term with an oath before the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

**2020 is back on the 2024 campaign trail**
With 30 days left before the 2024 election, Vice President Kamala Harris and her allies are focusing on former President Donald Trump's actions on January 6, 2021, and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Harris' campaign is using the issue to remind voters of Trump's 'attempt to stay in power by unraveling the foundations of our republic,' as former Rep. Liz Cheney put it. Cheney said, 'Our republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before — a former president who attempted to stay in power by refusing to accept the lawful results confirmed by dozens of courts of the 2020 election.' Harris' campaign is also airing ads featuring local couples who previously supported Trump but now oppose him due to his actions on January 6. Trump's campaign has blamed the media for the renewed focus on January 6, but polls show that voters are concerned about the issue, with 89% saying 'preserving democracy' is a factor in their vote. A recent poll found that 95% of voters say the economy is a factor in their vote, but 89% also say preserving democracy is a factor, with 64% saying it would be a 'deciding factor' in their decision.

**US Presidential Elections 2024: All you need to know about 2024 elections in the United States**
With less than two months remaining until Election Day, the recent debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump offered a critical insight into the contentious presidential race. Harris presented a strong case against Trump, confronting him on issues such as abortion, immigration, and the state of American democracy. The two candidates have starkly differing visions for the country. The election is scheduled for Tuesday, November 5, 2024, and the winning candidate will hold office for a four-year term starting in January 2025. Key issues dominating the 2024 election include the economy, healthcare, climate change, immigration, national security, and social justice. The Democrats are considered the more liberal party, advocating for civil rights, a broad social safety net, and initiatives to combat climate change. The Republicans, on the other hand, represent conservative values, promoting lower taxes, government reduction, gun rights, and stricter immigration and abortion policies. Harris's nomination for the upcoming November elections would be historic, mirroring her achievement in 2020 when she became the first woman, Black woman, and person of South Asian descent to serve as Vice President of the United States. Harris is recognized for her advocacy on issues such as criminal justice reform, healthcare, and immigration. Trump, on the other hand, is an American businessman, television personality, and politician who served as the 45th president of the United States from January 20, 2017, to January 20, 2021. For the 2024 elections, he has secured the Republican nomination.

Presidential historian Thomas Whalen believes that Kamala Harris will be the next President of the United States, stating that she 'knocked it out of the park' in the recent debate against Donald Trump. Whalen praised Harris' direct engagement on issues like climate change, which resonated particularly well with younger voters. In contrast, Trump appeared to 'unravel' by the end of the debate, ignoring questions and making 'crazy uncle talk' about executing babies and eating dogs. Whalen expressed concern over Trump's continued rhetoric about election fraud, warning that it could increase the likelihood of violence in January 2025.

The election is expected to be decided by razor-thin margins, and the results may not be known for days.

**2024 US Presidential Election: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Lead the Pack**
The 2024 United States presidential election is set to take place on November 5, with two main candidates vying for the top spot: Kamala Harris, the current Democratic vice president, and Donald Trump, the former Republican president. Harris is focusing on continuing the policies of the Biden administration, emphasizing climate change, social justice, and voting rights. Trump, on the other hand, is reiterating his 'Make America Great Again' rhetoric, focusing on the economy, border security, and reducing federal government power. The election will be decided by the Electoral College, with each state having a number of electors equal to its number of senators and representatives. The candidate who wins the majority of the 538 electors, more than 270, will become the next president of the United States. If no candidate reaches this threshold, the House of Representatives will decide the winner. The new president will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025.

**US Presidential Elections: 60 Million Have Already Voted**
With the US presidential elections just five days away, the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is neck and neck, with both candidates competing in key states like Nevada and Arizona. The results in the southern parts of Georgia and North Carolina are also still uncertain, according to new CNN polls. In the US electoral system, voters do not directly elect the president, but rather the 538 members of the electoral college. The winner will be determined by the candidate who receives at least 270 electoral votes, which will be cast by the electors on December 17. The votes will be counted on January 6, 2025, and the new president will be inaugurated on January 20. The US electoral system is decentralized, with each state having its own election laws. Early voting is an option for voters, allowing them to cast their ballots before November 5. Over 60 million voters have already cast their ballots in 47 states and the District of Columbia, where the capital Washington is located, according to CNN. This represents about 38% of the approximately 158 million votes cast in 2020. Ten states have already surpassed 50% of the total votes from four years ago, led by Georgia, where over two-thirds of the votes have already been cast. As said by CNN, 'It's a significant turnout, especially considering it's just five days before the election.'

**Kamala Harris Delivers Scathing Closing Argument Against Donald Trump**
In a symbolic location, with the columns of the White House lit up in the night of Washington, Kamala Harris delivered her 'closing argument' against Donald Trump on October 29, 2024, one week before the November 5 election. The vice-president accused Trump of seeking 'unlimited power' and opposing her vision for 'a future full of promises'. Harris said, 'This election is 'the most important vote of your life', a choice between 'a country anchored in freedom for every American or one led by chaos and division'. 'We know who Donald Trump is,' she continued. 'He's the person who stood here, almost four years ago, and sent an armed mob to the Capitol to overturn the voice of the people in a free and fair election.' Harris described Trump as 'an unstable candidate, obsessed with vengeance, consumed by resentment, and seeking unlimited power' who wants 'to use the army against American citizens simply because they disagree with him, people he calls 'the enemy within'.' She contrasted this with her own 'to-do list' of priorities if she becomes president on January 20, 2025, including lowering the cost of living by 'cutting taxes for workers and the middle class' and passing a law against 'excessive price increases for food products'. Harris also promised credits for early childhood education and aid for first-time homebuyers.

**Election 2024 Latest: With 1 week to go, Harris speaks in Washington as Trump stumps in Pennsylvania**
Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her campaign's 'closing argument' in Washington, D.C., one week before the 2024 election. Harris emphasized the importance of the election, saying that voters will have the chance to make a decision that directly impacts their lives and the future of the country. She also attacked former President Donald Trump's competency on the international stage, saying that world leaders think he is an easy mark. Harris pledged to 'restore' abortion rights and to work every day to build consensus and reach compromise to get things done. Trump responded to Harris' speech, calling it 'backward-looking' and saying that Harris is lying, name-calling, and clinging to the past. Trump also claimed that the Harris campaign had bused people to Washington for her rally. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden said that he hopes to 'keep Donald Trump out of the White House' and praised Harris for her efforts to win over Republicans and former Trump supporters. Harris took the stage in Washington, surrounded by American flags and signs that read 'Freedom' in block letters, and delivered a speech that was a direct contrast to the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. She emphasized the importance of unity and said that 'our democracy doesn't require us to agree on everything.' Harris also spoke about her plans to address issues such as immigration and the economy, and said that she will be at Howard University on election night if elected.

Harris said, 'I think it is very important for the American people to see and think about who will be occupying that space on January 20.' She also accused Trump of being 'full of grievances' and using 'dark language' that is about 'retribution and revenge.' Harris said, 'It is either going to be that, or it'll be me there, focused on my to-do list, focused on the American people, and getting through that list of goals and plans to improve the lives of the American people.'

**US Presidential Election 2024: Latest News on Trump and Kamala Harris**
The US presidential election is just a few days away, and the anticipation is building as to who will win. According to national polls, Vice President Kamala Harris has a slight lead over Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump. However, experts note that national polls may not reflect the final result, as the US electoral system is indirect. In most states, the winner takes all the electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, where the votes are allocated proportionally. To win the presidency, a candidate needs to secure more than 270 electoral votes. The final count will take place on January 6, 2025, and the winner will be sworn in as President on January 20, 2025.

**US election 2024: When will we know the result as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump face off in November 5 poll**
The 2024 US presidential election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is expected to be a contentious one, with Trump claiming that only a 'fair' decision will be respected. The election will take place on November 5, but the result may not be clear for several days or even weeks due to recounts, early voting, and mail-in ballots. Republican-led legislatures have moved to restrict voters' choice and contest the integrity of absentee ballots, leading to a bigger chance of challenges being heard and upheld. Further judicial hearings are likely after November 5, with both parties preparing a rearguard of lawyers. The Electoral College is scheduled to convene on December 17 to certify the result, and the declaration of the result in Congress on January 6, 2025, is also a key flashpoint. Trump has threatened to turn the armed forces on Democrats who object in the event of him winning, but much of this will likely be empty bluster. It may take a while to play out before the next president is inaugurated on January 20, 2025.

**2024 United States Presidential Election: Key Facts and Dates**
The 2024 United States presidential election is approaching, with voters set to choose between incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. The election will take place on November 5, 2024, and will determine not only the next President of the United States but also the composition of the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate. The President of the United States serves as both head of government and head of state, but the Congress plays a crucial role in the legislative process and can even remove the President from office. The election will also determine the governors of 11 states and two territories. To be eligible for the presidency, a candidate must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years old, and a resident of the country for at least 14 years. The President is limited to two terms, which can be consecutive or non-consecutive. The winner of the election will be determined by the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors chosen by each state. The President-elect will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, in a ceremony at the Capitol Building. If no candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes, the House of Representatives will choose the President, and the Senate will choose the Vice President. This has only happened twice in U.S. history. 'The election is a crucial moment for the country, and it's essential to ensure that every vote is counted and every voice is heard,' said a spokesperson for the Democratic Party. 'We're confident that our candidate will win, but we're also prepared for any scenario,' added a Republican Party spokesperson.

**Guess Who Certifies Trump’s Election**
In January 2025, Vice-President Kamala Harris will be responsible for certifying Donald Trump's election. However, Harris has previously described Trump as 'fascist to the core,' 'unfit to serve,' and 'increasingly unstable and unhinged.' This rhetoric has already led to multiple attempts on Trump's life, and some speculate that Harris may refuse to acknowledge the will of the people in order to safeguard what she considers 'Our Democracy.' The Biden/Harris regime has also expressed a desire to throw Trump in prison if he loses the election. Meanwhile, a recent poll shows Trump flipping Wisconsin against Harris, and some are concerned that the Party of the Liberal Establishment may resort to cheating to maintain their control.

**What to Expect from the US Presidential Election**
The US presidential election is approaching, with the majority of states allowing early voting or mail-in voting. Although the polls predict a close election, there may be unexpected developments until election day on November 5. The Democratic campaign, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, and the Republican campaign, led by former President Donald Trump, will focus on key battleground states. It is essential for Americans to register to vote as soon as possible, with 23 states and Washington, DC allowing same-day registration. The election process will continue beyond election day, with potential lawsuits and recounts in some states. The outcome may not be known on election day due to the increase in mail-in voting. After the election, the Electoral College process will begin, and the new Congress will take office on January 3, 2025. In the unlikely event of a tie in the Electoral College, the new Congress will decide the election. Harris will preside over the vote count on January 6, 2025, and the next President will take the oath of office on January 20, 2025.

The United States presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024, with over 240 million eligible voters. The election process will conclude on January 20, 2025, when the winner will be formally inaugurated on the Capitol steps. Citizens can exercise their right to vote by mail, with over 65 million votes cast through this system in 2020. The election is not a direct vote for the president, but rather for the 538 members of the Electoral College, who will ultimately choose the next president based on the population of each state. To win, a candidate must secure at least 270 electoral votes in a session on December 17. The Electoral College results are recorded on a 'certificate of vote' and sent to Congress and the National Archives. On January 6, Congress receives and counts the electoral votes, with Vice President Kamala Harris presiding over the joint session. The winner will be inaugurated as the 47th president of the United States on January 20, 2025, with a formal oath-taking ceremony before the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. As stated by the article, 'the election is not casual, but rather a carefully planned process that has remained largely unchanged since the country's independence.'

**US Elections: Key Dates from Voting to Presidential Inauguration**
On November 5, American citizens will exercise their right to vote, although the president will not begin their term until January 20. The election process is based on a series of phases that have remained largely unchanged since the country's independence. The final stage will be on January 20, 2025, when the inauguration will take place on the Capitol's steps. The election is not a coincidence, as it is always held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of leap years. The promoters of this date chose November to facilitate transportation and avoid winter months, and added a condition to avoid coinciding with the holiday on November 1. The citizens do not directly elect the president on November 5, but rather the 538 members of the Electoral Council, who will designate the future occupant of the White House based on the population of each state. To ensure victory, a candidate needs to surpass the threshold of 270 votes in a session that will take place on December 17. The Electoral Council's result is recorded on a 'certificate of vote' and sent to Congress and the National Archives. On January 6, Congress receives these electoral votes, counts them, and certifies them in a joint session led by Vice President Kamala Harris. The winner of the election will be inaugurated as the 47th president of the United States on January 20, 2025, with a formal beginning of their term with an oath before the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

**2020 is back on the 2024 campaign trail**
With 30 days left before the 2024 election, Vice President Kamala Harris and her allies are focusing on former President Donald Trump's actions on January 6, 2021, and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Harris' campaign is using the issue to remind voters of Trump's 'attempt to stay in power by unraveling the foundations of our republic,' as former Rep. Liz Cheney put it. Cheney said, 'Our republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before — a former president who attempted to stay in power by refusing to accept the lawful results confirmed by dozens of courts of the 2020 election.' Harris' campaign is also airing ads featuring local couples who previously supported Trump but now oppose him due to his actions on January 6. Trump's campaign has blamed the media for the renewed focus on January 6, but polls show that voters are concerned about the issue, with 89% saying 'preserving democracy' is a factor in their vote. A recent poll found that 95% of voters say the economy is a factor in their vote, but 89% also say preserving democracy is a factor, with 64% saying it would be a 'deciding factor' in their decision.

**US Presidential Elections 2024: All you need to know about 2024 elections in the United States**
With less than two months remaining until Election Day, the recent debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump offered a critical insight into the contentious presidential race. Harris presented a strong case against Trump, confronting him on issues such as abortion, immigration, and the state of American democracy. The two candidates have starkly differing visions for the country. The election is scheduled for Tuesday, November 5, 2024, and the winning candidate will hold office for a four-year term starting in January 2025. Key issues dominating the 2024 election include the economy, healthcare, climate change, immigration, national security, and social justice. The Democrats are considered the more liberal party, advocating for civil rights, a broad social safety net, and initiatives to combat climate change. The Republicans, on the other hand, represent conservative values, promoting lower taxes, government reduction, gun rights, and stricter immigration and abortion policies. Harris's nomination for the upcoming November elections would be historic, mirroring her achievement in 2020 when she became the first woman, Black woman, and person of South Asian descent to serve as Vice President of the United States. Harris is recognized for her advocacy on issues such as criminal justice reform, healthcare, and immigration. Trump, on the other hand, is an American businessman, television personality, and politician who served as the 45th president of the United States from January 20, 2017, to January 20, 2021. For the 2024 elections, he has secured the Republican nomination.

**Presidential historian: 'Kamala Harris will be the next president'**
Presidential historian Thomas Whalen believes that Kamala Harris will be the next President of the United States, stating that she 'knocked it out of the park' in the recent debate against Donald Trump.

In contrast, Trump appeared to 'unravel' by the end of the debate, ignoring questions and making 'crazy uncle talk' about executing babies and eating dogs. Whalen expressed concern over Trump's continued rhetoric about election fraud, warning that it could increase the likelihood of violence in January 2025.
