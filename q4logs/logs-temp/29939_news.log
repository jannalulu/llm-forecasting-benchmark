**Trump planning flurry of executive orders for first day, top aide says**
Donald Trump's incoming chief of staff, Susie Wiles, revealed that Trump plans to sign a flurry of executive orders on his first day back in the White House to reinstate signature policies from his first presidency. According to Wiles, Trump will likely reinstate policies such as leaving the Paris climate agreement, withdrawing from the World Health Organization (WHO), and banning entry to citizens from predominantly Muslim countries. Trump also plans to revive the Schedule F initiative, which would remove job security from civil servants and enable them to be fired and replaced with right-wing loyalists. Wiles stated that Trump aims to transform the government in two years, rather than four, anticipating more political resistance in the second half of his term. Several of Trump's probable executive orders are likely to face legal challenge, including one revoking birthright citizenship and another banning schools from promoting critical race theory or transgender issues.

**Trump to Revoke Biden's Executive Orders in First Week**
US President-elect Donald Trump will cancel many of the executive orders issued by the Biden administration in its first week, according to Carolyn Livitt, Trump's campaign press secretary. 'All executive orders signed by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to deviate from the effective political course of Trump's first administration will be revoked,' Livitt said in an interview with Fox News. Livitt added that Trump will sign over a dozen executive orders in his first week. She also stated that the 94 executive orders signed by Biden in his first week, which she described as 'on the brink of crisis and economic decline,' will be reversed.

**Bidenâ€™s 2024 Federal Register page count already second highest ever**
The 2024 Federal Register page count has reached 89,476 pages, making it the second-highest yearly count of all time, with over a month and a half to go. This is a significant increase from the 89,368 pages in 2023 and the 79,856 pages in 2022. According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the costs imposed by the rules of 2024 are among the highest on record. President Biden has instructed agencies to advance progressive aims through whole-of-government regulatory initiatives, resulting in big jumps in page counts. The article notes that Donald Trump's regulatory streamlining priority was an anomaly, and a thicker Federal Register generally means more regulations. The article suggests that if Trump formalizes his promised one-in, ten-out campaign for rules in 2025, the Register could flex again.

**Trump to Revoke Biden's Executive Orders in First Days as President**
Donald Trump plans to revoke executive orders issued by the Biden administration in his first days as president, according to his press secretary, Caroline Leavit. She stated that Trump will sign dozens of corresponding orders in the Oval Office in his first weeks as president. Leavit explained that the 94 executive orders signed by Biden in his first week in office 'led to a crisis on the border and an economic crisis.' 'That's why Trump was re-elected - to reverse the steps taken by the Biden and Harris administration,' she added. Trump won the presidential election on November 5, 2024, and the inauguration of the new president is scheduled for January 20, 2025.

**3 Ways the Left Plans to Stack Every Branch of Government | @amacforamerica**
Democratic Party candidates in the 2024 election have proposed policies that would fundamentally transform all three branches of government, assure permanent left-wing power, and effect the domination of American politics by a polarized ideological minority. One of these plans involves 'stacking' the Supreme Court by expanding its size and packing it with liberal judicial activists. This idea has been discussed openly in the Democratic Party, with 11 presidential hopefuls supporting it in the 2020 primaries. President Joe Biden signed Executive Order 14023 to study the issue, but the commission's report concluded that court-packing could undermine the Court's legitimacy and be perceived as a partisan maneuver. 'The risks of Court expansion are considerable,' the report stated.

**A Proclamation on National Veterans and Military Families Month, 2024 | The White House**
President Joe Biden has proclaimed November 2024 as National Veterans and Military Families Month. He expressed gratitude to military and veteran families, saying 'We owe them a debt of gratitude we can never fully repay.' The President highlighted various initiatives to support veterans and military families, including the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, which has provided new benefits and services to over 1.1 million veterans and 11,000 survivors. He also mentioned efforts to prevent military and veteran suicide, eliminate homelessness, and improve financial security for military families. Additionally, the President signed an Executive Order to support the economic security of military families and veterans' spouses, caregivers, and survivors. He emphasized that these actions are personal for him and his family, who have experienced the pride and pain of having a loved one serve in the military. The President called upon the people of the United States to honor veterans and military families with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

**'Biden Bucks' Could Change Elections Forever**
The Biden-Harris administration's Executive Order 14019 has been criticized as 'Biden Bucks' for its potential to alter the election process and favor Democrats. The order directs government agencies to promote voter registration and turnout, but critics argue that the implementation has been biased. Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for The Oversight Project, stated, 'If you target it neutrally, probably not the worst thing in the world. We want civic engagement in the country.' However, Brosnan also noted that the plans submitted by government agencies to promote voter registration have been largely shielded from the public, and that some agencies have partnered with liberal NGOs that push radical ideas such as noncitizen voting and felon voting. Brosnan said, 'They're actually implementing this executive order and putting their thumb on the scale for the federal government to support one candidate over another and juice turnout again.' The potential impact of 'Biden Bucks' on the 2024 presidential election could be significant, especially in Arizona and Michigan, where numerous infirmities in the U.S. election system could dramatically affect the election results.

**Darklore Depository 2024: A Halloween Inventory Of Federal Agency Guidance Documents**
The U.S. Federal Register has reached 86,712 pages, the third-highest annual count of all time, with two months yet to go. Federal agency guidance documents, including statements of policy, memoranda, and notices, are not reliably cataloged and archived. An informal inventory of these documents has uncovered 108,023. The Trump administration's Executive Order 13,891 required public disclosure of agency guidance documents, but this was revoked by the Biden administration. Some agencies continue to report guidance documents, while others have frozen or deleted their counts. The article highlights the challenges of tracking and categorizing guidance documents, with many agencies presenting 'indeterminate' tallies due to the complexity and ambiguity of their guidance. The article concludes that while progress has been made in transparency and disclosure, more needs to be done to address the issue of regulatory dark matter.

**Missouri attempts to halt Bidenâ€™s voter registration executive order**
The state of Missouri is attempting to overturn a 2021 executive order signed by President Joe Biden that aimed to educate voters about how to register to vote. Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft argued that the order is a federal overreach and that the state already has an election system in place. However, an attorney representing the U.S. Department of Justice stated that the state has failed to present any evidence that the executive order has caused harm. The state's attorney claimed that the order will lead to an added burden for the state by verifying voter registration information shared through federal channels. The case has been taken under advisement by the judge, and it's unclear when a ruling will be issued.

**Supreme Court rejects Republican-led challenge to Biden effort to ease voter registration**
The Supreme Court has rejected a challenge from Republican state lawmakers in Pennsylvania to a Biden administration executive order aimed at boosting voter registration. The justices did not comment on the decision, which comes after lower courts had dismissed the lawsuit. The challenge was led by nine Republican secretaries of state and 11 members of Congress, who claimed the order was an unconstitutional attempt to interfere in the November election. The court also rejected two other appeals related to baseless claims about Dominion Voting Systems and the 2020 presidential election, including a claim that the company tried to silence people who made such claims.

In May, the judges declined to take the case and issue a quick decision on it. Separately, the judges also rejected two appeals related to baseless claims made by Republicans that voting machines and Dominion Voting Systems software were responsible for Donald Trump's 2020 presidential election loss.

**US Supreme Court Rejects Republican Challenge to Biden's Voter Registration Order**
The US Supreme Court has rejected a Republican challenge to President Joe Biden's executive order increasing government involvement in voter registration and mobilization. The court denied the petition in the case of Keefer v. Biden without comment, with no dissenting judges. The order requires all federal agencies, including the prison system, to help increase voter registration and participation and promote mail-in voting. Critics say it will likely benefit Democrats more than Republicans. The main petitioner is Pennsylvania state Representative Dawn Keefer, a Republican. The 27 Republican state legislators from Pennsylvania challenged Biden's Executive Order 14019 of March 7, 2021, which requires all federal agencies to help increase voter registration and participation. They argued that the order was unconstitutional and that voter registration campaigns are not a legitimate function of government. They also challenged a voter registration order issued by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat. The legislators argued in their lawsuit that the executive actions violated their constitutional rights by usurping their power to prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections. Judge Jennifer Wilson of the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissed the lawsuit on March 26. 'The legislators were not legitimate to challenge an action that supposedly harmed the legislative assembly as a whole,' she wrote. 'They only alleged an institutional harm derived from a general loss of legislative power.' 'A vague and general allegation that elections, in general, will be undermined, is not the type of case or controversy that this court can pronounce on under Article III [of the US Constitution].' The legislators told the Supreme Court that they wanted an expedited consideration of the issue of standing, so if they prevail, 'they may obtain a preliminary injunction in the district court much before the November 2024 elections.'

**Supreme Court wonâ€™t hear challenge to Biden voter registration order**
The Supreme Court has declined to hear a challenge from Pennsylvania Republican lawmakers to a Biden administration executive order aimed at boosting voter registration. The order, signed in March 2021, allows nonpartisan third-party organizations to provide voter registration services on federal agency premises. The lawmakers claimed the order was unconstitutional and an attempt to influence the 2020 election. However, Chief Justice John Roberts previously addressed a similar argument in a 2023 decision, ruling that state legislatures are not insulated from state judicial review. The denial of the challenge is a blow to groups seeking more transparency behind the executive order's functions, including America First Legal, which has called the order an 'unprecedented election interference program'.

However, Chief Justice John Roberts previously addressed a similar argument in the 2023 case of Moore v.

US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled a new executive order to combat 3D printed and converted firearms, and improve schools' active shooter drills. Biden said machine gun conversion devices can be 3D-printed for under 40 cents in under 30 minutes, and are undetectable by security scanners. 'Enough,' Biden said, vowing to keep fighting against gun violence. Harris noted that more children are now killed by guns than any other cause, including car accidents or cancer. The order also directs federal agencies to develop information for schools on how to create and evaluate evidence-informed active shooter drills. Homicides have dropped 17% since Biden created an office on gun violence prevention one year ago, and mass shootings are down 20% in 2024 compared to last year.

**Ahead of the Election, Biden Rolls Out New Executive Action on Guns**
President Joe Biden has signed an executive order to create a federal task force to combat 'emerging firearms threats,' including cheap devices that can convert semiautomatic pistols into fully automatic machine guns. The task force, which will be responsible for developing a plan to combat machine gun conversion devices, has 90 days to issue a report. The executive order also seeks to crack down on 3D-printed guns and improve school active shooter drills. Biden said, 'The streets are flooded with machine gun conversion devices because the parts are small, cheap, and easy to make. The impact of these devices is devastating.' The task force will be composed of leaders from several federal departments and agencies. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said, 'We've been working with our U.S. attorney, with the Justice Department, to get machine gun conversions like Glock switches off our city streets.' Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'For as much as we have accomplished, more must be done. We need more leaders like the leaders in this room, in Congress, who have the courage to take action, to stand up to the gun lobby, and to put the lives of our children first.' The work may build on the administration's previous efforts to combat 'ghost guns.' 3D-printed firearms are typically produced at home with computer code downloaded from the internet and often lack a serial number, making them undetectable by law enforcement. Stefanie Feldman, the director of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, said, 'Some 3D-printed firearms can be made to be undetectable by magnetometers used to secure airports, courthouses and event spaces.' A second provision of the executive order aims to improve school-based active shooter drills, which have come under increasing scrutiny as parents, students, and educators say that some versions of the drills are traumatic. Christian Heyne, the president of the gun violence prevention group Brady, said in a statement, 'The Biden-Harris administration has been the strongest gun violence prevention administration in history, and today's news tells us they have no intention of slowing down.'

President Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive order on Thursday that aims to make active shooter drills less traumatic for students while still being effective. The order also seeks to restrict new technologies that make guns easier to fire and obtain. According to Stefanie Feldman, the director of Biden's office of gun violence prevention, the order will help schools create drills that 'maximize their effectiveness and limit any collateral harms they might cause.'

**Biden Takes Aim at 3D-Printed Firearms, Machine-Gun Conversion Devices in Executive Order**
President Joe Biden's administration has released a new executive order aimed at reducing gun violence, targeting machine-gun conversion devices and 3D-printed firearms, as well as improving active-shooter drills in schools. The order comes after a mass shooting in Birmingham, Ala., where local law enforcement believe the shooters used conversion devices. Biden will direct a task force to assess the threat these weapons pose and the federal agencies' operational and legal capacities to detect and seize them. The order also sets out to improve school-based active-shooter drills by keeping guns away from potential school shooters and investing more federal resources in school safety and gun-violence prevention. According to the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, there has been a 17-percent drop in the national homicide rate between January and June, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the Gun Violence Archive reported that the number of mass shootings so far in 2024 has dropped by 20 percent. Biden said, 'The Biden-Harris administration's latest effort to crack down on gun violence.'

**President Joe Biden Proclaims Tuesday, September 17, 2024, as National Voter Registration Day**
President Joe Biden has proclaimed Tuesday, September 17, 2024, as National Voter Registration Day. He emphasized that American democracy begins and ends with the ballot box, and that voting defines our threshold of liberty. However, there are forces trying to suppress voters and subvert elections. To combat this, Biden signed an Executive Order to promote non-partisan access to voter registration and election information. Federal agencies have worked to make voter registration more accessible for veterans and college students, and the Department of Justice has doubled its voting rights enforcement staff. Biden called on all eligible Americans to ensure they are registered to vote and to cast a ballot in upcoming elections. He also encouraged Americans to verify their registration and to help their neighbors do the same.

The Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act must be passed by Congress to fully secure the right to vote in every State.
