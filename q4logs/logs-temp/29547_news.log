**Elon Musk: How High Will He Not Climb?**
Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has evolved from a genius inventor and successful entrepreneur to a rival geopolitical player. Since taking control of Twitter, intervening in the Ukraine war, and dominating the space market, Musk's empire has surpassed the model and changed dimension. Musk's ambition is not financial, but to transform the universe and humanity, even if it means spending everything to achieve it. He has become a rival to the liberal Western order and a threat to the European Union, particularly with his support for Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign. Musk's empire is virtual, with no physical territory, but he has built his own space of sovereignty with his galaxy of satellites, rockets, and social media platform. He is treated with the respect and deference usually reserved for heads of state, and his fortune is estimated to be over $350 billion, which could make him the first billionaire by 2027. Musk's vision is to create a new, all-powerful human being, and he is using his platform to promote his conception of the world and intervene in politics. As Nicolas Fouquet's motto 'Quod non ascendet?' (How high will he not climb?) suggests, Musk's ambition knows no bounds.

**The Richest Person In America 2024**
Despite a $7 billion decrease in his net worth, Elon Musk remains the richest person in America for the third consecutive year, with an estimated $244 billion fortune. Musk's lead over Amazon's Jeff Bezos has narrowed to $47 billion, with Bezos' fortune increasing by $36 billion since last year. Musk's Tesla holdings have declined by $53.6 billion due to the company's stock falling 14% and a Delaware judge voiding $56 billion of Musk's performance-based Tesla stock options. However, Musk's influence has grown, and he has emerged as a major supporter of Donald Trump. Two of Musk's other companies, xAI and SpaceX, have soared in value, offsetting most of his Tesla losses. Musk remains bullish about the future of Tesla and predicts that the company could one day achieve a valuation of more than $25 trillion, making him the world's first trillionaire.

Musk's lead over Amazon's Jeff Bezos has narrowed to $47 billion, with Bezos' fortune increasing by $36 billion since last year.

**Elon Musk: How High Will He Not Climb?**
Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has evolved from a genius inventor and successful entrepreneur to a rival geopolitical player. Since taking control of Twitter, intervening in the Ukraine war, and dominating the space market, Musk's empire has surpassed the model and changed dimension. Musk's ambition is not financial, but to transform the universe and humanity, even if it means spending everything to achieve it. He has become a rival to the liberal Western order and a threat to the European Union, particularly with his support for Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign. Musk's empire is virtual, with no physical territory, but he has built his own space of sovereignty with his galaxy of satellites, rockets, and social media platform. He is treated with the respect and deference usually reserved for heads of state, and his fortune is estimated to be over $350 billion, which could make him the first billionaire by 2027. Musk's vision is to create a new, all-powerful human being, and he is using his platform to promote his conception of the world and intervene in politics. As Nicolas Fouquet's motto 'Quod non ascendet?' (How high will he not climb?) suggests, Musk's ambition knows no bounds.

**Elon Musk on Track to Become World's First Billionaire by 2027**
According to CNBC, Elon Musk could become the world's first billionaire by 2027. His net worth has skyrocketed in recent years, from approximately $152 billion in December 2020 to around $220 billion in October 2024. The majority of Musk's wealth comes from his Tesla stock, which saw a significant increase in value during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As CNBC reports, Musk's net worth is expected to continue growing, potentially making him the world's first billionaire by 2027.

**The Richest Person In America 2024**
Despite a $7 billion decrease in his net worth, Elon Musk remains the richest person in America for the third consecutive year, with an estimated $244 billion fortune. Musk's lead over Amazon's Jeff Bezos has narrowed to $47 billion, with Bezos' fortune increasing by $36 billion since last year. Musk's Tesla holdings have declined by $53.6 billion due to the company's stock falling 14% and a Delaware judge voiding $56 billion of Musk's performance-based Tesla stock options. However, Musk's influence has grown, and he has emerged as a major supporter of Donald Trump. Two of Musk's other companies, xAI and SpaceX, have soared in value, offsetting most of his Tesla losses.
