**Orange Jewelry Models for Fall 2024: How to Style Them**
In the fall and winter of 2025, the color orange will be the star of the season in the world of jewelry, combining vitality and warmth. It is a color inspired by the brightness of the sun, giving you a lively and warm look, especially when combined with gold. According to an expert, to make the most of this season's look, we present to you orange jewelry models for fall 2024 and how to style them with your outfits to make a statement wherever you go. The orange gemstone jewelry has become a popular choice among many women, after several famous jewelry brands have showcased stunning designs featuring orange gemstones, such as citrine and orange sapphire. One of the standout designs is the Fanfare Symphony necklace from Gerard Garrard, made of 18-karat yellow gold, featuring a round orange sapphire weighing 0.27 carats, 14 round diamonds weighing 0.11 carats, and 7 pieces of golden mother-of-pearl that harmonize with the yellow gold, adding a touch of magic and allure to the design. This necklace is perfect for a simple everyday look with calm-colored outfits, and can also be styled with evening outfits for a more dramatic look. The orange gemstone jewelry not only adds a touch of elegance but also carries a positive energy, making the wearer feel free and full of life, thanks to its bright color. The Bezel Mixed Drop necklace from Shay Shay is another stunning piece, featuring a modern design that grabs attention, especially with the droplet-shaped orange gemstones. Made of 18-karat white gold, it features a white diamond weighing 0.19 carats, a mix of citrine and yellow sapphire weighing around 4 carats, and various designs ranging from pears to hearts, and circular and rectangular shapes, as well as marquise cuts. This necklace will look great with a soft autumnal coat or a simple dress, and can also be layered with a short chain that complements it. The orange gemstone rings add an exceptional touch to your finger, especially when they feature a luxurious design that showcases the gemstone in the center, drawing attention to its vibrant color. The Fluted ring from Fabergé is a unique and exclusive design, part of the Colours of Love collection, made of 18-karat pink gold, featuring a round spessartite weighing 1.43 carats, 22 orange sapphires weighing 0.25 carats, a Mozambican sapphire weighing 0.02 carats, and 2 round diamonds weighing 0.02 carats. This combination of gemstones makes it a luxurious piece that is perfect for evening and night events, and can be worn with a formal evening dress to add to the drama of your look. The dangling earrings are a great option for special occasions or everyday wear, and look stunning in orange, which complements the autumn atmosphere, adding a touch of brightness to your face, as the orange gemstones reflect the light in a magical way. We were impressed by the Reveal earrings from Boghossian, made of 18-karat yellow gold, featuring a droplet-shaped design that hangs from the earlobe with 2 round citrines weighing 3.40 carats, 2 oval ossetian weighing 38.26 carats, 8 citrines in pear shapes weighing 0.60 carats, and a touch of brilliance with diamonds weighing 0.33 carats. Thanks to its vibrant color, it is suitable for everyday looks with light or dark outfits, as well as formal evening dresses in black or white. The orange gemstone necklaces, or those with innovative designs that combine orange and gold, are characterized by their elegance and allure, especially when they are inspired by nature, such as the sun or flowers. To revamp your look with orange jewelry models for fall 2024, follow these tips: Look for simplicity: If you tend to wear calm colors in your outfits, such as black, white, or light brown, adding an orange jewelry piece, such as a ring or necklace, can be perfect to add a touch of life to your look without overdoing it. Use matching jewelry pieces: Choosing multiple jewelry pieces of the same color but in small or medium size can help achieve a balanced and attractive look. For example, pairing an orange ring with small earrings in the same color can draw attention to the details without overwhelming the look. Style the colors that complement the orange gemstone: Orange complements colors such as white, black, beige, earthy tones like brown, and gold, as well as warm colors like red or pink to create a lively and bright look.

**Goodbye Beige and Terracotta: The Top Color Trends for 2025**
This autumn-winter 2024-2025, the color is bold and unapologetic. Gone are the days of the grey and industrial aesthetic of the 2000s, and the neutral chromatic palette that came with it. According to decorator Juliana de Giacomi, 'Before, people seemed to be afraid of color, it was shunned. We stuck to a minimalist, Pinterest-inspired home, and it was almost sterile.' The new color trends for 2025 are bold and vibrant, but not so overwhelming that they cause eye strain. Think sophisticated dark red, warm brown, and buttery yellow. The beige and terracotta of the past are being replaced by the grey pigeon, burnt orange, and caramel brown. These new colors are perfect for creating a feel-good atmosphere, and can be incorporated into your space through accent walls, accessories, or furniture.

**Advent 2024: Preparing for the Jubilee Year 2025**
The Advent season, which begins on the Sunday closest to St. Andrew's Day (November 30th), is a time of preparation for the Catholic Church to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ and the start of the Jubilee Year 2025. This year, Advent begins on December 1st. The season is divided into two parts, with specific readings for Sundays and weekdays. The first part, from December 1st to 16th, features readings from the book of Isaiah and the Gospels. The second part, from December 17th to 24th, focuses on the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, which tell the story of Jesus' birth. The color purple is associated with Advent, symbolizing penance and austerity. A traditional Advent custom is the Advent wreath, which consists of a circle of green branches and four candles (three purple and one pink). The first purple candle is lit on the first Sunday of Advent, December 1st. The second purple candle is lit on the second Sunday of Advent, December 8th. The third candle is pink, representing joy, and is lit on the third Sunday of Advent, December 15th. The fourth and final purple candle is lit on the fourth Sunday of Advent, December 22nd. During Advent, Masses for the deceased and the celebration of saints and solemnities are not allowed on Sundays. However, weddings can receive a special blessing, and the decoration of the altar is simple, with music played in moderation.

**Colors to Avoid When Welcoming the New Year 2025**
According to astrologers, it's best to avoid certain colors when welcoming the New Year 2025 to avoid bad luck and misfortune. The symbol of the New Year 2025 is the Green Wooden Snake. To ensure a happy and prosperous year, astrologers recommend wearing clothes that don't offend the snake. Green, orange, and yellow colors are said to attract good luck, while brown suits are recommended for men. Women should wear silver and gold dresses. Wearing clothes with a snake print is also a good idea. However, astrologers advise against wearing purple, black, gray, fluorescent, and red colors, as well as blue or blue-green outfits, as they may offend the snake and lead to negative consequences. Wearing clothing made from real snake skin is also strictly forbidden.

**6 Tons de Ruivo para os Cabelos em 2025**
According to Bella Assumpção, a renowned hairstylist, 2025 will be the year of red hair, with a palette of rich and versatile tones that range from natural to bold. The tones vary from soft to intense, offering options that adapt to different styles and preferences. Bella launched the Sertões collection in October 2024, which features three new red hair tones inspired by nature and the strength of Brazilian landscapes: cacau, cor buriti, and ruivo cajá. 'The red hair brings a natural shine to the face and is perfect for those who want a sophisticated transformation without losing naturalness,' says Bella. The expert highlights that the red hair is ideal for those with fair skin, as its reflections enhance natural luminosity, but it also looks great on medium skin tones. 'This color is perfect for those who seek a more natural look, with a soft touch of red that blends with the brown tones,' explains Bella. She emphasizes that the cacau tone values fair and medium skin tones, giving a warm and harmonious effect. 'The buriti red is ideal for warm skin tones, such as dark and black skin, creating a stunning contrast. It illuminates the face and brings a fresh and natural vibe to the look,' highlights Bella. The cajá red is a more vibrant tone, approaching a golden orange. 'This red is perfect for those who want a bolder look, but still with a natural touch,' suggests the expert. It is versatile and can be adapted to different skin tones, especially for those with fair and medium skin and who seek a modern and personality-filled transformation. For those who want to be bold, the neon orange will be one of the most striking colors. 'This tone is ideal for extroverted people, who are not afraid to be the center of attention. It combines with all skin tones, but is especially vibrant on dark skin,' explains Bella. Another bet for 2025 are the warm, reddish tones, such as wine. 'These tones bring intensity and sophistication, creating a striking effect, especially on dark and black skin. It's a color that brings glamour and depth,' suggests the expert. Red hair for all hair types The tones of the Sertões collection and the other red hair trends for 2025 are extremely versatile. 'These colors were developed to value all skin tones,' says Bella, who adds: 'The secret is to adapt the tone to your personal style and find the nuance that best suits you. The Buriti Red, for example, is great for warm skin tones, while the Cacau is perfect for those who want a more natural look.' Hair care for red hair Bella reminds that red hair requires special care. 'As they are colors that fade quickly, it's essential to use specific shampoos and conditioners for colored hair and do weekly hydrations to maintain the health of the hair,' says. She also emphasizes the importance of using UV protection on the hair, especially in the summer, to prevent color fading. With a wide range of tones - from natural cacau to vibrant cajá red - 2025 will be the ideal year for those who want to express themselves through a red hair that is full of authenticity and style.

**The Color Report: Every Shade Worth Remembering From the Spring 2025 Shows**
The spring/summer 2025 fashion shows marked a shift away from the quiet luxury trend of the past few seasons, with a focus on bold and vibrant colors.

Although Pantone has not officially announced the color, rumors and predictions are circulating among experts, with one of the tones that sounds strong being Future Dusk, a shade that combines blue and purple, evoking the serenity and freshness of cloudy landscapes. This color projects calmness and tranquility, and its versatility will allow it to be the protagonist in both daytime and nighttime looks, depending on how it is combined with other tones and textures. Future Dusk recalls the Very Peri of 2022, but with a greater inclination towards blue, making it colder and more serious. It is an elegant and contemporary option that adapts to a wide range of styles and occasions. The article also mentions previous Pantone colors, including Ultimate Gray and Illuminating (2021), Very Peri (2022), Viva Magenta (2023), and Peach Pink (2024). For 2025, the color is expected to be widely used in formal suits and dresses, elegant shirts, and accessories, and will be a great option for those looking for a refined and timeless look.

**Orange Tariff to be Introduced in Greece in 2025**
A new 'orange' dynamic tariff will be introduced in Greece in 2025, which will be based on the fluctuations of the wholesale market. To choose this tariff, consumers must have a 'smart meter' that can record hourly consumption. According to the Deputy Minister of Environment and Energy, Alexandra Sdoukou, the orange tariff will be available to business consumers with smart meters from the beginning of 2025. It is estimated that by the end of 2025, around 1.5 million supplies will have dynamic tariffs, accounting for about 60% of total energy consumption. Additionally, from 2025, the obligation for all suppliers to offer a 'green' tariff will be abolished. The green tariff was a mandatory offer that was based on a specific mathematical formula to allow for comparison between the green tariffs of all providers. However, it is expected that the green tariff will gradually decline as a product, as only certain categories of consumers will not be able to make a different choice. The market is now shifting towards 'blue' fixed tariffs, which are considered the most reliable option for simple household consumers. The increase in the wholesale market this summer, which affected both green and blue variable tariffs, has highlighted the stability of fixed tariffs as the safest choice for consumers.

**Largest ‘Supermoon’ of the Year Coming this Week with Potentially Orange Hue**
The largest supermoon of 2024, known as the Hunter's Moon, will reach its peak illumination this week at 7:26 a.m. on Thursday, with the best viewing time being that evening. According to WKRC, the supermoon will be the brightest at its closest position to Earth, about 220,000 miles away. The moon may appear orange due to a thicker layer of air and the blue wavelengths scattered by the atmosphere, giving it a 'jack-o-lantern-like' color. The Hunter's Moon is also sometimes referred to as the Sanguine or Blood Moon.

**What color to wear to meet the new 2025 year?**
According to the Chinese calendar, the upcoming year 2025 will be under the auspices of the Green Wooden Snake. This reptile symbolizes strength, wisdom, patience, harmony, and balance, as well as the ability to adapt to change. Green is a color associated with growth, development, good fortune, and prosperity. When choosing a dress for the New Year's Eve, it's recommended to opt for 'snake-like' shades such as green, olive, khaki, or emerald. These calm, deep colors complement each other well. Natural snake colors like sandy, brown, gray, milk, white, black, and dark colors are also suitable. New Year's dresses can be red, blue, or orange, and also include mysterious purple, rose shades, including delicate pink, explosive fuchsia, noble marsala, gold, and silver. The snake prefers strict styles and single-colored fabrics. Therefore, when choosing a dress or suit for the New Year, it's better to focus on classic models that emphasize the figure but don't draw too much attention. It's essential that the items are made from natural materials such as cotton, linen, or wool. Additionally, you can use decorative elements like sequins, embroidery, lace, or beads that imitate snake skin. Don't be stingy with accessories. They can be different: malachite, silver, gold, or with natural stones. It's better to avoid items with neon shades, strong contrast, and synthetic materials. Accessories made of natural snake skin, such as belts or handbags, should not be used on New Year's Eve, but a snake print is acceptable. Don't use cheap jewelry, artificial fabrics, and loud, flashy outfits: the Snake values elegance and good taste.

**Tintas Suvinil chooses three colors for 2025: Despertar, Marrom Luxo, and Sossego Noturno**
The Tintas Suvinil, a Brazilian paint company, has chosen three colors for 2025: Despertar (a vibrant yellow that evokes hope and renewal), Marrom Luxo (a terracotta tone that connects with the essential and reflects new sophistication), and Sossego Noturno (a hybrid blue-violet tone that represents harmony between humans, technology, and nature). According to Bruna Galliano, the company's creative director and color consultant, 'In a complex and multifaceted time, a single color would not be able to summarize the sentiment of the time. Choosing more than one is a great analogy of how different ideas and opinions can coexist and create new possibilities that benefit everyone.' The company's research showed a sense of community, a new tomorrow, and a new today, which led to the selection of these three colors. The Coral paint company, on the other hand, has chosen Curry Dourado (a warm and lively yellow) as its color for 2025, which is meant to transform any space and help people step out of their comfort zone. The Pantone Color Institute has not yet announced its color for 2025, but the WGSN, a company that specializes in consumer trends, has chosen Future Dusk (a blue-purple tone).
