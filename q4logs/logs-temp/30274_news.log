Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrij Sybiha is scheduled to meet with Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg in Vienna tomorrow, Wednesday.

US Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian Nichols stated that the allowed use of ATACMS by Ukraine 'will give her more opportunities'.

**Trump's Ukraine Plan May Be Delayed Until 2025, Turkish Analyst Says**
Turkish analyst Engin Ozer believes that the 'peace plan' developed by Donald Trump's team, aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine, will likely be delayed until early 2025. According to Ozer, the plan includes Ukraine's refusal to join NATO in the near future and 'freezing' the conflict. The project for a ceasefire agreement in the conflict zone will likely be postponed until early 2025 and will begin to be implemented after Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2025, Ozer said. Ozer also linked the possible permission of Joe Biden for strikes deep into Russian territory with the failures of the Ukrainian army on almost all fronts of the special operation.

**Ukraine's Zelensky Rules Out Ceasefire Talks with Russia Until End of War**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced that Ukraine will not negotiate a ceasefire with Russia until the end of the war, which is expected to last until 2025. Zelensky stated that the war will be 'a very difficult' one, similar to the one in 2014. The announcement comes after former US President Donald Trump's return to power, which has raised concerns about the future of the conflict. Zelensky said, 'I understand what Russia is doing.' Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to isolate Ukraine diplomatically if it does not agree to a ceasefire. The Kremlin has denied reports of a phone call between Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, which was said to have taken place last week.

**Zelensky and Trump: A Path to Peace in Ukraine?**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the war with Russia could end by 2025. He is counting on the future US President Donald Trump to help bring about a peaceful resolution. Trump has stated that he will focus on ending the war as soon as he takes office in January 2025. Zelensky has outlined three key principles for a peaceful solution: a quick resolution, no return to pre-war borders, and maximum pressure on all levels. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin is pushing for a deal that reflects the 'new territorial realities' and does not allow Ukraine to join NATO. The war has been ongoing for over two years, and both sides are exhausted. Trump has a plan to put pressure on both Russia and Ukraine, which could lead to a ceasefire. However, Ukraine's President Zelensky needs security guarantees to ensure that Russia does not use a ceasefire as an opportunity to launch a new attack. The two sides are engaged in a war of attrition, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The US has removed restrictions on the delivery of long-range missiles to Ukraine, which could give them an advantage in the war. Trump has stated that he will be 'very hard' on both Russia and Ukraine, and has hinted that he could cut off military aid to Ukraine if they do not agree to a ceasefire. Ukraine has agreed to put off its bid to join NATO for at least 20 years in exchange for security guarantees from the US.

**Zelensky: War with Russia Will End 'Faster' Under Trump Administration**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the war with Russia 'will end faster' under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump. He added, 'The war will end, but there is no specific date for it. Of course, with the policy of this team that will lead the White House now, the war will end faster.' Zelensky emphasized that 'a fair peace' is very important for Ukraine. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, 'President Biden has committed to making sure every dollar we have is available to us from now until January 20.' He added that NATO countries should focus on 'ensuring Ukraine gets the money, ammunition, and troops to fight effectively in 2025, or be able to negotiate peace from a position of strength.' Despite Ukraine's insistence that it will not give up any territory occupied by Russia in any peaceful settlement, Ukrainian officials have now given priority to obtaining security guarantees for their country's future, at least as much as they value a potential ceasefire agreement. With Ukraine's forces losing territory continuously in the east, two senior officials said that defending Ukraine's interests in potential talks will not depend on the country's territorial boundaries, which are likely to be determined by the battles, but on the security guarantees available to maintain a ceasefire.

**Alexander Musiyenko's War Prognosis: 'Not Before...'**
Political expert Alexander Musiyenko shared his opinion that the war in Ukraine will not end this year. Musiyenko believes that Ukraine and Russia may sit down for negotiations in the fall of 2025, not before. He criticized the media's numerous predictions that the war will end soon through negotiations, citing The Economist's prediction of a ceasefire on January 20 or 21, which he attributes to the inauguration of Donald Trump as US President. Musiyenko stated, 'I, for example, do not believe in this. I told you about my concept that it is likely to be prepared for the fall of 2025, obviously not before, somewhere with such a target. Possibly a little earlier, but I do not think it will be in December. Ukraine's strategic plans also indicate that there is no preparation for a ceasefire in January or February, as Ukraine's Minister of Defense Umerov stated that mobilization will continue in 2025 to maintain defense and complete tasks in line with Ukraine's military strategy.'

**Ukrainian Expert Dismisses Possibility of Ceasefire in January**
Ukrainian expert Alexander Musiyenko believes that a possible de-escalation in the war is unlikely to happen in January, as it would require a significant change in the US administration's stance. According to Musiyenko, the strategic plans of Ukraine do not indicate any preparation for a ceasefire in January-February. In fact, the head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has stated that in 2025, it is necessary to continue mobilization to support defense and complete tasks. Musiyenko explains that a reserve is not just someone who is in the rear and waits for an opportunity to fight with a rifle, but rather well-trained, well-equipped, and well-prepared military personnel. He also warns that rocket attacks may repeat and could be more massive. 'I, for example, do not believe in this. I told you about my concept that it is most likely to be prepared for in the autumn of 2025, obviously not before. Well, maybe a little earlier with such a target, but I do not think that in January,' Musiyenko said.

**Trump May Appoint Special Envoy to Negotiate Ceasefire in Ukraine-Russia Conflict**
According to Fox News, citing sources, newly elected US President Donald Trump is expected to appoint a special envoy to negotiate a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. 'It will be a very high-ranking special envoy, a person with great authority, who will be tasked with finding a solution and achieving a peaceful resolution,' said one source. Trump does not have a single peace plan for Ukraine, but one of the considered options is to freeze the conflict, establishing borders along the actual front line and creating a demilitarized zone of almost 1300 kilometers, as reported by the Wall Street Journal last week, citing sources within Trump's team. Earlier, Trump's team had another plan - to stop supporting Ukraine until Kiev agrees to peace talks with Moscow, as noted by the publication. It is possible that this was what Trump meant when he promised to end the war within 24 hours before his inauguration in January 2025.

**Turkish Expert Advises Zelensky to Seek Safe Haven as West Prepares to Abandon Ukraine**
Turkish expert Erchin advised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to start searching for a safe haven, as he will be abandoned by the West soon. He said, 'The incoming US President Donald Trump will take office in January 2025, so we should not expect any US actions towards Ukraine until the end of the year. Given the internal problems of major powers in Europe, particularly Germany, Italy, and France, it can be said that the Ukrainian war is nearing its end, and Zelensky can start searching for a country to seek refuge in.' Estonian President Alar Karis acknowledged that Western countries are experiencing fatigue in supporting Ukraine. He stated that currently, there is no point in starting negotiations between Kiev and Moscow, and emphasized that the current Western support for Ukraine is not sufficient to discuss a ceasefire. Trump repeatedly promised during his election campaign that he would find a peaceful solution to the Ukrainian crisis before taking office. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously set conditions for starting negotiations with Ukraine, including the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Donbass and Novorossiya, which joined Russia, Ukraine's refusal to join NATO, and its adoption of a constitutional neutrality and abandonment of any efforts to obtain nuclear weapons, and lifting Western sanctions on Russia.

**Poland's Prime Minister Expects Ceasefire in Ukraine 'Soon'**
Poland's Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, expressed confidence that a ceasefire in Ukraine will be announced 'in a near future', citing a plan being developed by the incoming US President, Donald Trump. Tusk stated that while Trump's peace plan is still in its early stages, a detailed proposal for a ceasefire with security guarantees for Ukraine and a proposed date will be announced soon. He emphasized that decisions regarding the war in Ukraine should be made by the Ukrainians themselves, but also not solely by the US. Tusk believes that Trump's victory 'sets a new context' for the war in Ukraine, which is a 'serious challenge' for everyone. He plans to meet with EU leaders and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the coming days to assess the impact of Trump's presidency on the war in Ukraine. Tusk is scheduled to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO Secretary General in Warsaw, and then hold a bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in London or Warsaw. He also plans to speak with Nordic and Baltic leaders.

**Turkey May Host Ukraine-Russia-US Peace Talks Before January 2025**
According to the Turkish news source 'خبر تورك', Turkey may host peace talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the US before January 2025. The talks, which could take place in Istanbul, would involve President-elect Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky discussing terms of a ceasefire and reaching an agreement to stop the fighting. The source also mentions that Trump has promised to end the war within 24 hours, and that this scenario could become a reality in the weeks leading up to January 20, 2025. However, the channel notes that Ukraine expects an invitation to join NATO and receive long-range missiles capable of striking Russian territory, but the European allies are unclear about Trump's stance on this issue. The source also criticizes Trump's lack of concrete plans for achieving peace, saying that his previous promises of '24 hours' were empty and that the outcome for Ukraine would likely be severe.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that a ceasefire without guarantees of security would mean the full occupation of Ukraine. He also criticized some of Ukraine's partners for their 'very dangerous rhetoric', saying 'Let's stop the war first, and then we'll see.' Zelensky emphasized that a bilateral security agreement with Hungary has not been signed because it does not include a clause supporting Ukraine's accession to NATO. He expressed his disappointment with the lack of substance in his conversation with former US President Donald Trump, saying 'We had a good conversation and meeting, but it needs to be more substantial.' Zelensky believes that Trump wants a quick solution, but this approach is not effective, and that Ukraine needs to be prepared for any outcome.

**Zelensky Urges Allies to Maintain Military Support for Ukraine in 2025**
Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky urged his allies to maintain military support for his country in 2025 to achieve a 'just and quick' end to the war with Russia. 'Ukraine wants a just and quick end to this war (...) I would like it to be at the latest next year, 2025', Zelensky said during a visit to Berlin. 'For us, it's very important that the aid does not decrease next year', he emphasized alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Zelensky is closing a two-day European tour in Berlin, where he is seeking to secure more military support for his country, which has been invaded by Russia for over two and a half years. Scholz, whose government plans to cut in half in 2025 the amount of bilateral military aid to Ukraine, reassured Zelensky that his country's support will not waver. 'Our support for Ukraine will not falter', he promised. The search for 'a just and lasting peace for Ukraine remains the guiding principle of our joint action', Scholz emphasized, adding that the allies will not accept 'a peace dictated by Russia'. Zelensky's tour comes at a difficult time on the ground, with the Russian army continuing to advance in the eastern front and reiterating the capture of two new localities. In the Odesa region, at least four people died in Russian bombings during the night, according to the regional governor. Scholz announced a short-term aid of 170 million euros (around $186 million) to repair damaged infrastructure. Since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, the head of the Catholic Church has multiplied calls for peace, without result and with some friction with Kiev. In March, Jorge Bergoglio sparked a diplomatic crisis between Kiev and the Vatican by calling on Ukraine to 'raise the white flag and negotiate'. Zelensky denied that the goal of his tour is to discuss a possible ceasefire with Russia, but rather to present his allies with his 'plan for victory'. The objective is 'to create the conditions for a just end to the war', he said, adding that 'Ukraine can only negotiate from a strong position'. This plan, of which no details are known yet, is expected to be unveiled at a peace summit in November, at a date to be determined. 'The question here is Ukraine, but also the defense of the West and how we maintain our security', said Rutte, who promised to keep Ukraine among his priorities.

**Zelensky: Ukraine wants a fair and quick end to the war by 2025**
Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky said on Friday that he would like the war with Russia to end by 2025 at the latest and urged international aid to Kiev not to stop before then. 'Ukraine (...) wants a fair and quick end to this war (...) I would like it to be at the latest next year, 2025', Zelensky said in a meeting in Berlin with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, adding that 'it is very important' that aid 'does not decrease next year'. Zelensky's plan also includes an immediate invitation to join NATO and more arms to improve Ukraine's position on the battlefield and force Russia to start negotiations on favorable terms for Kiev. Scholz reiterated Germany's solidarity, praised the courage of the Ukrainians, and said that peace can only be achieved based on international law and that a peace 'dictated' by Russia cannot be accepted. Germany has announced a new package of military aid to Ukraine worth 1.4 billion euros, which will be provided by Germany, Belgium, Denmark, and Norway before the end of the year. This package includes IRIS-T and Skynex air defense systems, Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, artillery systems, combat drones, and other equipment. Germany has also provided a package of 600 million euros in military aid, including the fifth IRIS-T system, tanks, artillery systems, and drones. Additionally, Germany has approved an extra 170 million euros in assistance to repair the damage to Ukraine's electrical infrastructure caused by Russian bombing and to restore the supply before winter. Germany has also allocated 4 billion euros in bilateral direct aid to Ukraine in its 2025 budget.

**Lavrov Describes Russia's Reaction to Ukraine's New 'Peace Summit' Announcement**
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Russia is not following the statements made by Ukraine regarding a new 'peace summit' that is expected to take place by the end of 2024. According to Lavrov, 'We do not follow such statements from Ukrainian politicians of various levels, it's not interesting to us. The position of the Russian Federation has been clearly stated by the President of Russia [Vladimir Putin] on June 14 at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This position is consistent and is being implemented in practice, and we will bring this matter to its conclusion.' Lavrov's statement comes after Ukrainian Ambassador to Turkey Vasyl Bodnar announced that Ukraine plans to hold a second 'peace summit' with Russia by the end of 2024, excluding the possibility of direct bilateral negotiations with Russia. Putin previously stated that for a ceasefire and the start of negotiations with Ukraine, Kiev must withdraw its troops from the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, as well as the Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics, and then renounce NATO membership.

**Zelensky: Ceasefire Not on the Table with Western Allies**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Ukraine is not discussing the possibility of a ceasefire with its Western allies in exchange for guarantees. Zelensky made the statement during a press conference after meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky said, 'This is not the topic of our discussions, any kind of ceasefire, with other allies, and we did not discuss this [with Macron]. I saw in the media today, there was a lot of information that I came to talk about a ceasefire. But no. It's not like that.' Zelensky also reiterated plans to hold a second 'peace summit' in November. The details of Zelensky's 'plan for victory' are unknown, but he promised to reveal them after consulting with partners. The Times reported that four out of five points of the plan are: guarantees of security for Ukraine from the West, 'similar to the NATO mutual defense pact', continued operation of the Ukrainian army in the Kursk region, a request for 'specific' modern weapons, and international financial aid to Ukraine. The Kremlin promised to achieve success in the military operation regardless of Ukraine's statements about the plan. A Ukrainian official, Daria Zaryova, stated that the second 'peace summit' will not take place in November, before the US presidential elections. The date of the event will be determined after the thematic conferences in late October. Ukrainian Ambassador to Turkey, Vasyl Bodnar, said that Ukraine plans to hold a summit with Russian representatives by the end of the year, but excludes bilateral meetings. 'Now we see the following: the international community together with Ukraine will sit down and make a list of steps that can be taken to establish a just peace in Ukraine, and they will discuss what requirements to present to Russia based on this list,' Bodnar explained. The first 'peace summit' took place in June in Switzerland. The basis for discussion was the 'formula for peace' proposed by Ukraine. After the summit, Ukrainian authorities allowed the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin at the second conference. The Russian authorities excluded participation in the 'peace summit' and criticize Ukraine's 'formula for peace'. The Kremlin insists on resolving the conflict on its own terms: recognizing the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions as part of Russia, withdrawing Ukrainian troops from there, and Ukraine's refusal to join military alliances and lifting sanctions. These conditions were announced by President Vladimir Putin before the first 'peace summit'. The Ukrainian authorities considered this initiative an ultimatum.

**Zelensky Denies Ceasefire Talks with West, Reiterates Plans for Second 'World Summit'**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denied that a ceasefire is being discussed with Western leaders. He also stated that the second 'World Summit' should take place in November, although earlier in Kyiv this was denied. Moscow excludes participation in the summit. Zelensky said, 'This is not the topic of our discussions, any kind of ceasefire, with other allies, and we did not discuss it [with Macron]. I saw in the media today, there was a lot of information that I came to talk about a ceasefire. But no. It's not like that.' Zelensky also reiterated plans to hold the second 'World Summit' in November, saying, 'The next 'World Summit' should take place in November. The plan [for victory] will be on the table. I don't know the exact date, I think no one knows today. But we will prepare everything we decided at the beginning of November. The plan will be with all the details.' Details of Zelensky's 'plan for victory' are unknown, he promised to reveal them after consulting with partners in Kyiv. The Times learned about four of the five points of the plan: guarantees of security for Ukraine from the West, 'analogous to the NATO mutual defense pact', continuation of the Ukrainian military operation in the Kursk region, a request for 'specific' modern weapons, and international financial aid to Ukraine. The Kremlin promised to achieve success within the framework of the military operation regardless of Ukraine's statements about the plan. Earlier, the advisor to the President's Office of Ukraine, Daria Zarovna, said that the second 'World Summit' would not take place in November, before the US presidential elections (November 5). The date of the event will be determined after the completion of thematic conferences at the end of October. According to Zarovna, the outcome of these conferences will be a communique, the provisions of which 'will become the basis for the upcoming 'peace plan' of the second summit.' Ukrainian Ambassador to Turkey Vasyl Bodnar later stated that Kyiv plans to hold a summit with the participation of representatives of Moscow before the end of the year, but excludes bilateral meetings of delegations. 'Now we see the following: the international community together with Ukraine will sit down and make a list of steps that can be taken to establish a just peace in Ukraine, and they will discuss what requirements to impose on Russia based on this list,' Bodnar explained the format of the event. The first 'World Summit' took place in June in Switzerland. The basis for discussion was taken from the 'formula for peace' proposed by Kyiv. After the summit, Ukrainian authorities allowed the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin at the second conference.

Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky denied that a ceasefire with Russia is a topic of discussion during his tour of European capitals to present his 'plan for victory' for Ukraine. 'The ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine is not a topic of our discussions (...) with our allies,' Zelensky said after meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, who asked for more military aid. Zelensky began a hectic tour of Europe on Thursday, seeking to renew support before the US elections and present his 'plan for victory' to his allies. Before his trip to Paris, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer received Zelensky in London, where they discussed the 'plan for victory' for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion that began in February 2022. Zelensky stated that the goal is 'to create conditions for a just end to the war,' adding that 'Ukraine can only negotiate from a strong position.' This vague plan is expected to be revealed at a peace summit in November. 'The question here is Ukraine, but also the defense of the West and how we will stay safe,' said Mark Rutte, the new NATO Secretary-General, who has committed to keeping the Ukrainian issue at the top of his agenda and visited Kiev last week. Zelensky will meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome on Thursday night and will be received by Pope Francis at the Vatican on Friday morning. He will conclude his European tour in Berlin on Friday, where he will meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, amid plans to cut the bilateral military aid to Ukraine in half in 2025.

**Zelensky Discusses Conditions for Ending the War**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the situation on the front allows for considering the end of the war in 2025. He called on allies to consolidate, integrate, and 'strengthen defensive capabilities', reminding that Ukraine has bilateral security agreements with 26 countries, which 'has a decisive significance'. Zelensky said, 'With resolute actions, the war can end no later than 2025. Italy, Germany, the UK, France, and the US have always worked for European security. Together, we can achieve everything we want.' He emphasized that the war in Ukraine 'threatens the stability of Eastern Europe and all Russian threats are real.' Zelensky is willing to sign a ceasefire agreement on the current front line, but without recognizing the loss of territories and 'without recognizing a new official border.' In return, he needs Western guarantees and security guarantees from the US, similar to those provided to Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. Zelensky believes that an invitation to join NATO should strengthen Ukraine now, before possible negotiations on ending the war. He announced this as the first point of his 'victory plan', which would ensure geopolitical security in Europe and weaken Russia's pressure. 'As for NATO, it is a point of the 'victory plan'. As I have already said, it is aimed at strengthening Ukraine. And in my opinion, there should be no skepticism from partners in this matter, if we simply do not fear the Russian Federation. We want to take the first step – get an invitation to the alliance, which, however, is not a synonym for NATO membership,' Zelensky said. 'We are talking about strengthening our positions now, not after the war, not in 10 years, not in 30 years. Right now. This strengthening is a chance to be strong and in the political aspect during some diplomatic movements, during some or other negotiations, in the future,' he added.

**Zelensky Hopes to End Conflict by 2025**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that he hopes to end the conflict by 2025 and that the situation on the battlefield creates such an opportunity. According to Reuters, Zelensky said, 'In October, November, and December, we have a chance to move towards peace and stable stability. The situation on the battlefield creates the opportunity to make this choice - the choice of resolute actions to end the war no later than 2025.' He added that in November, Kyiv plans to prepare a 'formula for peace' to be presented at the second 'peace summit'. Ukrainian Ambassador to Turkey Vasyl Bodnar previously stated that Ukraine plans to hold the second 'peace summit' this year with Russia's participation. However, he ruled out the possibility of direct bilateral negotiations with Russia at the meeting and noted that Kyiv will not consider Moscow's demands.

**Zelensky Prepares to Present 'Plan for Victory' at Ramstein Group Meeting**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is reportedly ready to discuss the terms of negotiations with Russia and end the war, according to Bloomberg. Zelensky has announced that he will present a 'plan for victory' at the Ramstein Group meeting, which includes 'concrete steps for a just end' to the conflict. However, the plan has been met with a cold reception in the United States, with some Republicans criticizing Zelensky for meddling in American politics before the November elections, as reported by The Washington Post. The New York Times has also written that 'Zelensky's star is fading'. Western allies have increased pressure on Kyiv to present a concrete plan to end the war, as reported by Bloomberg. A US official stated that since Kyiv has not yet revealed all the details of its plan, Ukrainian officials can use strategic ambiguity to their advantage. Another official noted that 'credible bilateral security guarantees from the United States during ceasefire negotiations would in reality mean Ukraine's membership in NATO'. It is unclear what formula will bring all parties to the negotiating table, as Moscow opposes Ukraine's membership in the Alliance. Zelensky announced that he will present his 'plan for victory' on October 12 at the Ramstein Group meeting, which will be attended by US President Joe Biden. The meeting will take place at the US military base in Ramstein, Germany. 'We are preparing for Ramstein. It will be the 25th meeting in this format, but the first at the level of leaders. We will present a plan for victory, clear and concrete steps for a just end to the war. The determination of our partners and the strengthening of Ukraine are what will stop Russian aggression,' Zelensky wrote on Telegram.

**'Won't meet Putin if...': Harris rules out truce talks with Russia if Ukraine is not represented**
US Vice-President Kamala Harris, who is running for the presidential election, has ruled out meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin for truce talks if Ukraine is not represented. Harris stated, 'Not bilaterally without Ukraine, no. Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine.' This marks a shift in the US position on negotiating peace with Russia, which launched an invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Harris also criticized Republican rival Donald Trump's policies on Ukraine, calling them a 'surrender' to the invasion. Trump has suggested that he could quickly reach a peace deal with Putin, but Harris believes this would involve ceding territory to Russia. Harris said she would deal with Ukraine's bid to join the Nato military alliance 'if and when it arrives at that point'.

**Ukrainian Military Expert Predicts End of War in 2025**
Colonel Petro Chernyk, a Ukrainian military expert, has expressed his predictions about the possible terms of the end of the active phase of the war. According to Dialog, which cites 'URA-Info', Chernyk stated that 'only 10% of what we see externally is what is actually happening in reality'. He believes that there are certain prerequisites for the war to end soon, citing Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 'reflexion' as a sign that the conflict is moving towards a ceasefire. Chernyk also mentioned the 'unique and unprecedented' 30 bilateral security agreements that have been made, which he believes are a sign that the war is nearing its end. In conclusion, Chernyk stated, 'My conclusion. Next year will be some kind of completion. The question is, on what positions. The main point, to be understood correctly, is that our main task is to preserve statehood. We have already accomplished this task. This is very serious. There will be no territorial concessions. We will eventually take back everything that is ours. I have no doubts, but we need to be critical realists and look objectively at everything that is happening around us.'
