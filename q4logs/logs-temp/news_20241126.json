According to Chris Whitten, 2025 president of the Rhode Island Association of Realtors, 'It's tough for younger buyers to compete with that. Down-payment assistance programs help slightly, but lack of inventory, higher prices, and interest rates are still the biggest pain points preventing our younger generations from starting to build equity through homeownership.' However, the condo market offers hope, with a 15.1 percent hike in sales and a 37.3 percent increase in inventory, making it more attractive to first-time buyers. Whitten added, 'The net worth of a homeowner is $415,000 compared to $10,000 for a renter,' emphasizing the importance of increasing the supply of homes to help younger generations achieve homeownership.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2024 10:21 PM\nSource:[Boston](https://www.boston.com/real-estate/real-estate/2024/11/25/house-prices-rise-ri-cash-buyers-dominate/)\n\n**Will 2025 Be a Buyer’s Housing Market? Zillow’s Bold Predictions**\nZillow predicts a more balanced housing market in 2025, with a potential shift in favor of buyers, especially in the Southwest. The forecast includes a modest increase in home sales, a slower pace of home value growth, and a continued volatility in mortgage rates. Buyers can expect more selection and negotiating power, while sellers may face uncertainty and increased competition. Additionally, Zillow anticipates a shift towards smaller, more sustainable, and affordable homes, as well as a decrease in renter-friendly concessions. Pet-friendly properties are becoming a must-have, with nearly 58% of renters now having pets.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2024 07:48 PM\nSource:[noradarealestate.com](https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/will-2025-be-a-buyers-housing-market-zillows-bold-predictions/)\n\n**Here's what the housing market will look like in 2025**\nZillow predicts a more active housing market in 2025 with more inventory and modest home value growth. According to Skylar Olsen, Zillow's chief economist, 'Buying a home in 2024 was surprisingly competitive given how high the affordability hurdle became. More inventory should shake loose in 2025, giving buyers a bit more room to breathe.' Zillow forecasts a 2.6% home value growth in 2025, with 4.3 million existing home sales. However, mortgage rates are expected to be volatile, with potential swings throughout the year. Additionally, Americans are shifting towards smaller homes and renting as a long-term lifestyle, with the term 'cozy' appearing in 35% more listing descriptions in 2024 compared to 2023.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2024 07:18 PM\nSource:[fox32chicago.com](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/housing-market-2025-will-look-like)\n\n**UK House Prices Rise for First Time in 7 Months, Exacerbating Housing Crisis**\nAccording to the UK's Office for National Statistics, the rate of house price inflation in the UK has risen for the first time in 7 months, reaching over 10% in the capital city, exacerbating the housing crisis for renters. The data shows that house prices increased by 7.8% annually in the UK last month, ending a 7-month decline in the rate of increase. Additionally, house prices rose by 9.0% monthly, the highest monthly increase since February last year. In London, house prices increased by 4.10% annually, the highest increase in the UK, and by 2.1% monthly. This increase in house prices is a new setback for renters, who are already struggling with a housing crisis, despite the UK's consumer price inflation rate approaching the 2% target set by the Bank of England. The UK's housing market is still experiencing a shortage of available properties, with a 24% decrease in available rentals in September compared to pre-pandemic levels, according to Zillow UK. The new Labour government in the UK has promised to do a lot to alleviate the suffering of renters, who are mostly forced to rent due to their inability to afford the cost of owning a home. However, critics say that the government's proposals, which include a ban on evicting tenants without a court order and stricter environmental regulations, have exacerbated the problem by causing property owners to sell their units rather than rent them out. The average monthly rent in London has increased by 26% compared to early 2022, reaching £2172 ( $7,275) per month, according to data from the Office for National Statistics.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 07:00 PM\nSource:[جريدة الشروق](https://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=20112024&id=d90a0305-6ef9-44c7-abaa-9be5d70d3816)\n\n**Rental prices in Spain to close 2024 with an 8% increase**\nThe rental market in Spain is expected to close 2024 with an 8% increase in prices compared to last year, according to Pisos.com. This is a three-point percentage increase from the 6% increase seen in 2023. The increase has been widespread, with some cities reaching double-digit price increases. Barcelona is the most expensive city in the country, with rental prices increasing by 18% this year. Ferran Font, director of studies at the agency, attributes the increase to the law of housing, which has caused many owners to take their properties off the market, resulting in a 60% reduction in the offer of rental properties in the last two years. The lack of new construction and the transfer of properties to the vacation rental market have also contributed to the price increase. Experts agree that there is a imbalance between supply and demand, which favors the increase in rental prices. Pisos.com projects a 10.3% increase in rental prices in the medium term, the highest rate in almost a decade. The competition in the rental market is driving the purchase of homes, which is emerging as an alternative for those with the ability to save. The number of transactions has increased by 41.5% in September compared to the same month in 2023, reaching a total of 61,887 operations.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 01:24 PM\nSource:[EL PAÍS](https://elpais.com/economia/2024-11-20/los-alquileres-cerraran-2024-un-8-mas-caros-respecto-al-ano-pasado.html)\n\n**Today’s Mortgage Rates Increase: November 19, 2024 Analysis**\nMortgage rates have increased recently, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate reaching 6.60% as of November 19, 2024. This rise is attributed to the strengthening economy, particularly in the labor market, which has placed upward pressure on interest rates. Despite expectations that rates might ease in 2025, many experts are cautious, citing the robust job market and high consumer spending. Homebuyers and those looking to refinance should consider their unique financial situations and weigh the costs and benefits of refinancing, as current rates are higher than previous months. According to Zillow, average rates for various mortgage types include: 30-year fixed: 6.63%, 15-year fixed: 6.06%, 30-year FHA: 5.73%, 30-year VA: 6.03%, and 7/1 ARM: 7.20%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 12:00 PM\nSource:[noradarealestate.com](https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/todays-mortgage-rates-increase-november-19-2024-analysis/)\n\n**The Real CPI May Already Be at 2% | Investing.com UK**\nThe official inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is reported to be around 2%, but this may be inaccurate due to the lagging nature of CPI data. The shelter component of CPI, which accounts for 40% of CPI, has been running at around 5% annually. However, rental prices, as reported by Zillow and Redfin, have not increased for the last year and a half, with the nationwide median asking rent down $53 from its all-time high in 2022. The author suggests that rent prices may start falling as existing home sale listings rise, and if mortgage rates head lower, the number of existing homes for sale will increase, further pressuring rent prices.

According to Zillow, a third of rental listings in October offered free rent or other perks, up 8% from last year. Nationwide, the share of rentals offering concessions has more than doubled over the last five years, from 16% in 2019 to a record 38% in 2024. Kara Ng, a senior economist at Zillow, said that this means renters have 'much more bargaining power' and that landlords are 'very motivated to fill' vacant apartments, especially heading into the holiday season. However, asking rents are still higher than last year in 48 of the 50 largest metro areas, with the typical asking rent in the Philadelphia region being $1,868, up 4% from last year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[arcamax.com](https://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-3485098)\n\n**Rent growth slows as inventory grows and concessions reach record levels**\nThe average asking rent in October was $2,009, a 0.2% decrease from September, according to a Zillow rental market report. This is a steeper drop than usual for this time of year, indicating a softening rental market. Despite this, rents are still up 3.3% year over year and 33.5% since the beginning of the pandemic. The influx of new apartments has slowed multifamily rent growth to 2.3% for the past year, and rental vacancies have risen to 6.9%. Rental concessions have reached record highs, with 37.7% of Zillow listings offering some form of concession in October. Rents fell in 34 major metropolitan areas, with the largest decreases seen in San Antonio and Denver.

The demand for rentals has increased due to university students' housing needs, marriages, divorces, business purposes, and urban renewal. The imbalance in supply and demand, as well as opportunity price increases, have driven rent increases over the past 4 years. While inflation has increased by 433% over the same period, rent increases have reached 570%. According to real estate experts, approximately 8 million tenants are in the market, with 250,000 new tenants joining each year. However, the difficulty of accessing housing has made it challenging for many to become homeowners. TSKB Gayrimenkul Değerleme General Manager Makbule Yönel Maya said, 'I think the high rent increase rate will start to slow down, but we can expect a real decline in sales prices for a while.' Maya added, 'The pandemic has caused a significant increase in prices, and the amortization period has decreased from 20-25 years to 15-16 years. I think this is a precursor to the slowdown in rent increases we saw in the past two years. I expect the rent increases to calm down, and sales prices will also stabilize.' Gayrimenkul Değerleme Uzmanı Ahmet Büyükduman said, 'Over the past 4 years, inflation has increased by 433%, while rents have increased by 570%. This means that rents have increased by 26% in real terms. The demand for rentals is increasing due to university students' housing needs, marriages, and other factors. The market is growing at a rate of 3% per year, with 250,000 new tenants joining each year. The prices of homes are not accessible, and the monthly payments are high. If the demand continues to increase, prices will rise rapidly. Therefore, I strongly believe that rent increases will be upward, and I expect them to be slightly above inflation.' \nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 09:24 PM\nSource:[Dünya](https://www.dunya.com/sektorler/emlak/kiralar-son-4-yilda-yuzde-570-artti-haberi-752658)\n\n**Annual Home Price Slowdown Continues, Says Report**\nAccording to CoreLogic, U.S. home price growth slowed to 3.4% year-over-year in September 2024, following months of modest monthly declines. Home prices rebounded slightly (0.02%) compared to the previous month. CoreLogic Chief Economist Selma Hepp said, 'Like much of the housing market at the moment, home prices remained relatively flat coming into the fall.' The uncertainty surrounding the U.S. election and mortgage rate volatility may be dampening demand and price appreciation.

According to Brenda Clement, executive director of HousingWorks RI, the high share of 'cost-burdened' individuals, who pay more than 30% of their income toward housing costs, has been a persistent problem for over 20 years. The report states that 55% of the lowest income renter households and an additional 17,043 households earning up to $59,172 are severely cost burdened. Clement noted that even high-income levels are affected, with households having to make sacrifices such as not buying a second car or going on a trip. The report also found that no municipality in the state can affordably purchase a single-family home for households with an income under $100,000, and that renters require an income of over $84,000 to afford a two-bedroom apartment. Melina Lodge, executive director of The Housing Network of Rhode Island, emphasized that the housing shortage in the state is a major contributor to the crisis, citing the state's size and zoning regulations as factors.

In the past two years, rent increases have been limited to 25%. Now that this policy has ended, everyone is wondering what the new rates will be. The inflation data for October will be announced on November 4, 2024 at 10:00, and this will determine the rent increase for November. Both tenants and landlords will use these data to set new rent prices. The rent increase will be influenced by the monthly and yearly inflation rates. According to the latest data from TÜIK, the consumer price index (TÜFE) has increased by 49.38% annually and 2.97% monthly. This data will directly affect the new rent prices that tenants will have to pay. The expectation is that the rent increase for November will be similar to the 12-month TÜFE rate of 63.47% announced last month.

According to Freddie Mac, the trend extends throughout the Northeastern and Midwestern regions, with Iowa, Nebraska, Wisconsin, and Connecticut seeing first-time buyer shares climb by more than 10% over the same period. However, the broader picture remains challenging for new buyers, with entry-level home prices growing 63% more than high-end home prices since 2000 and a severe supply crunch, with approximately 30 renter households competing for each available home for sale. 'Less affordable housing is acutely felt by those seeking to buy their first homes, especially those without substantial wealth at their disposal,' Freddie Mac's report says.

During the earnings call on October 30, 2024, Getty Realty also announced a 4.4% increase in quarterly dividends to $0.47 per share, continuing its 11-year streak of dividend growth. The company's efforts to attract capital were successful, raising $245 million through common stock and unsecured debt, which strengthened liquidity for future investments. Getty Realty's strategic actions, such as the Chipotle reconstruction project in Providence, Rhode Island, and the signing of leases for three new car wash projects, demonstrate a proactive approach to growth. The company's focus on direct deals with tenants and the completion of significant lease extensions have contributed to a strengthened portfolio. With a stable overall coverage ratio and improved performance in new assets, such as car washes, Getty Realty successfully navigates the current economic landscape, laying the foundation for future success. The company's expectation of announcing fourth-quarter and full-year results in February 2024 indicates a promising position as it continues to execute its growth strategy. InvestingPro's data also supports Getty Realty's strong third-quarter 2024 results. The company's market capitalization of $1.88 billion reflects its significant presence in the real estate sector. With a P/E ratio of 27.03, Getty Realty trades with a premium compared to some competitors, which may be justified by its stable growth and dividend performance. InvestingPro's recommendations highlight Getty Realty's impressive dividend history. The company has paid dividends for 30 consecutive years and increased them for 8 consecutive years. This aligns with the company's recent announcement of a 4.4% increase in quarterly dividends, demonstrating a commitment to shareholder returns that goes beyond its 11-year streak. The company's financial health also deserves attention. InvestingPro notes that Getty Realty's liquid assets exceed its short-term liabilities, confirming its strong liquidity position of over $495 million mentioned in the article. This financial stability is crucial for implementing the growth strategy in retail and automotive retail sectors. Getty Realty's revenue growth of 14.02% over the last 12 months, reported by InvestingPro, confirms the 13.1% increase in annual base rent compared to the previous year mentioned in the earnings report. Additionally, the company can boast a high gross margin of 88.85%, highlighting its operational efficiency.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 09:46 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Россия](https://ru.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/article-93CH-2544718)\n\n**Attention Tenants: Rent Increases by 227% in November**\nDespite the 2020 rent law being repealed, some tenants are still bound by the previous regulations and will see a 227.13% increase in their rent in November. This means that those who currently pay $150,000 per month will have to pay approximately $490,000. The increase is lower than the 238% rise in October, due to a decrease in the inflation index. Tenant associations are on high alert due to the difficulties tenants face in paying rent, with many families having to cut back on essential expenses to afford housing. According to real estate companies, the compliance rate is around 97%, but the reality is that families are making sacrifices to ensure they have a roof over their heads.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 12:19 AM\nSource:[corrienteshoy.com](https://www.corrienteshoy.com/info-general/atencion-inquilinos-los-alquileres-aumentaran-227-en-noviembre.htm)\n\n**US Rents Continue to Rise, but at a Slower Pace**\nAccording to Redfin, the average rent in the US increased by 0.6% in September, reaching $1634. This is in line with the trend of the past two years, where prices have remained within a range of $1599 to $1663. However, in 16 of the last 24 months, rents have been even more stable, between $1630 and $1650. Redfin's economist, Sheharyar Bokhari, noted that while rents have remained stable at a national level, the trend could be 'very different' depending on where you live. He explained that in areas with less construction, such as the East Coast and Midwest, rents are rising, while in cities with a high supply of new housing, such as those in the Sun Belt, rents are falling. The cities with the largest increases in rent were in the Midwest and East Coast, with Washington, D.C. experiencing a 12% increase. In contrast, Jacksonville, Florida, saw a 11.3% decrease in rent. Zillow reported that the increase in rent prices has slowed down due to a decrease in demand and an increase in inventory. Property managers are offering more concessions to attract tenants. Zillow estimated that prices will fall as new rentals enter the market. The Biden administration has proposed a law that would limit rent increases to 5% annually for landlords with more than 50 units. This would affect over 20 million rentals in the US. However, the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders have criticized the plan, saying it would infringe on property rights and discourage new construction.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 01:58 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN ÉPOCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/los-alquileres-de-viviendas-en-ee-uu-subiero-en-septiembre-1313095.html)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

According to Skylar Olsen, Zillow's chief economist, 'Buying a home in 2024 was surprisingly competitive given how high the affordability hurdle became. More inventory should shake loose in 2025, giving buyers a bit more room to breathe.' Zillow forecasts a 2.6% home value growth in 2025, with 4.3 million existing home sales. However, mortgage rates are expected to be volatile, with potential swings throughout the year.

This is despite the government setting a 25% cap on rent increases in July. The report also shows that rental inflation has been higher than general inflation since August, with a peak of 8.6 percentage points higher in November. Mehrdad Bazrpash, the former Housing and Urban Development Minister, had announced an average rent increase cap of 25% in June, but the regime's efforts to control prices through legislation have generally failed.

The decline is driven by condominiums, which make up most of Emeryville's for-sale housing market, with a 15.6% decrease in value. In contrast, single-family home values have increased by 10.5%. Real estate experts attribute the decline to weaker competition for condos, higher interest rates, and a shift in buyer priorities towards single-family homes with home offices and easy access to nature. Additionally, California's home insurance crisis has added complexity to the condo market, with many condo owners facing higher insurance costs and policy drops. The median asking price for a one-bedroom apartment in Emeryville has also declined by 4% over the past year, but remains among the highest in California.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 24, 2024 12:00 PM\nSource:[sfchronicle.com](https://www.sfchronicle.com/realestate/article/emeryville-home-value-city-19934696.php)\n\n**This housing market map shows Zillow’s revised 2025 home price forecast**\nZillow economists have revised their 2025 home price forecast, expecting a 2.9% increase in U.S. home prices between October 2024 and October 2025. They attribute this growth to low inventory, declining mortgage rates, and modest improvements in home sales indicators. However, they also note that modest increases in new listings and high mortgage rates will limit price growth. Zillow expects the strongest home price appreciation to occur in 10 areas, including Atlantic City, NJ (+6.5%), and the weakest in 10 areas, including Lake Charles, LA (-7.8%). Some housing analysts remain skeptical about Florida's housing market, citing increased inventory and declining condo prices.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 23, 2024 12:00 PM\nSource:[upstract.com](https://www.fastcompany.com/91233941/housing-market-map-zillows-revised-2025-home-price-forecast?ref=upstract.com)\n\n**Southern California Housing Prices Continue to Decline**\nThe housing prices in Southern California have been decreasing for three consecutive months, according to Zillow data. The median home price in the six counties of Southern California was $864,586 in October, a 0.4% decrease from September and 1% lower than the peak in July. However, it is still 4.5% higher than the same period last year. The recent decrease in housing prices is not a cause for concern, as it is a common phenomenon for housing prices to decrease in late summer and autumn. The main reason for the decrease in housing prices is that buyers' incomes are not keeping up with the rising housing prices. Recently, the number of homes for sale has been increasing steadily. According to industry experts, homeowners who purchased homes during the pandemic or with low-interest mortgages are now choosing to move to larger homes as interest rates have risen. In October, the number of homes for sale in all six counties of Southern California increased compared to the same period last year. Los Angeles County saw a 33% increase, San Bernardino County saw a 25% increase, and San Diego County saw a 49% increase. Another factor contributing to the decrease in housing prices is the rise in mortgage interest rates. Although mortgage interest rates have been declining since the summer, they have been increasing since October. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate was 6.78% on November 7, up from 6.08% in late September. Experts attribute the rise in mortgage interest rates to stronger-than-expected economic indicators and the policies proposed by former President Trump, including higher tariffs and a significant reduction in income tax. These policies are expected to lead to higher inflation and increased national debt, which typically puts upward pressure on mortgage rates. Despite the improvement in the housing supply shortage, the industry expects that housing prices will not decline significantly unless there is a recession. However, they believe that housing prices will slowly rise or remain relatively stable, giving buyers a chance to catch up with housing prices.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 06:44 PM\nSource:[radioseoul1650.com](https://www.radioseoul1650.com/archives/57357)\n\n**Housing tracker: Southland home price growth shows signs of slowing**\nSouthern California home prices have dipped for the third consecutive month, but remain near all-time highs and unaffordable for most households. The average home price in the six-county region was $864,586 in October, down 0.4% from September and 1% below the record reached in July. However, home prices are still 4.5% higher than a year earlier. The rate of home price growth is slowing, with prices peaking at nearly 9.5% in April and declining every month since. A housing shortage and rising mortgage interest rates are contributing to moderating price growth. Experts predict that home prices will climb more slowly or remain relatively flat, giving incomes a chance to catch up. However, it's unclear what impact former President Trump's proposed policies will have on the market. In contrast, asking rents for apartments in many parts of Southern California have ticked down, driven by a rising number of vacancies and a shift in the demographics of renters. However, rent is still extremely high, with the median rent for vacant units in Los Angeles County at $2,069 in October.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 11:05 AM\nSource:[Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-19/housing-tracker)\n\n**Los Angeles rezoning plan won’t spur enough new housing, report finds**\nA new analysis from UCLA researchers found that a soon-to-be-voted-on plan to rezone Los Angeles will fall short of its goal to build 250,000 new homes. According to the study, the current proposal will only increase the realistic capacity for new construction by about 30%. The researchers suggest that expanding development incentives to cover single-family-home neighborhoods, which make up 72% of the city's residentially zoned land, could triple the realistic capacity for building. However, city officials had previously considered allowing changes in these neighborhoods but reversed course after pushback from homeowner groups. Shane Phillips, Housing Initiative Project Manager at UCLA's Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies, said, 'The kinds of changes that would be necessary would need to be transformative rather than incremental.'

According to NAI Capital Executive Vice President Tim Steuernol, 'Things are so much more expensive these days, and there’s less discretionary income out there' to spend on housing. Developers are having to offer concessions to attract tenants, and a slowing construction pipeline may increase demand and raise rents in the years ahead.

Moussa Diop, an associate professor of real estate at the University of Southern California, said, 'Though the economy has proven quite robust, new housing supply and affordability remain on shaky ground.' The region's persistently rising cost of leasing is due to a housing shortage compounded by insufficient construction. Despite slowing rent hikes, tenants can still expect to pay more for their apartments over the next two years.

This change in inflation forecast also led to an update in the rent increase rates. Karahan stated that the interest rate forecast for 2024 is 21%, and that inflation is expected to decrease to 12% by the end of 2026. He emphasized that 'the tight stance in monetary policy will continue until a clear and lasting improvement in the inflation outlook is achieved.' This statement also highlighted the increasing coordination in Turkey's economic policies. The change in inflation forecast has also affected the rent increase rates. According to the Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) data announced by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), the rent increase for housing and workplaces is determined based on the 12-month average of TÜFE. Based on this regulation, the changes in inflation forecasts have reshaped the rent increases.

The recommended changes include reducing the maximum annual allowable rent hike from 8% to 5%, lowering the floor on rent increases from 3% to 2%, and removing a provision that lets landlords increase rents by another 1% if they cover a tenant's gas bill. Tenant groups are pushing for lower caps, citing findings that a majority of L.A. tenants are burdened by high rents. Landlords say the city is 'doubling down' on a failed policy, and that lowering the caps could drive small property owners to sell their buildings or spend less on upgrades.

Proponents of the Justice for Renters Act, or Proposition 33, argued it would help increase affordable housing, while opponents feared it could stymie new development and suppress property values. The measure's failure comes as local apartment developers are scaling back construction amid rising expenses and slower rent growth projections. Kevin Kawaoka, executive vice president at NAI Capital Investment Services Group, said, 'This will bode well for multifamily investment in Los Angeles, providing clarity in this rapidly changing investment landscape.' Kitty Wallace, vice chair at Colliers, claimed policies like Prop 33 would limit a landlord's ability to raise rents between tenants, putting a serious dent in potential profits and prohibiting development.

The inflation data for October will be announced on November 4, 2024 at 10:00, and this will determine the rent increase for November. Both tenants and landlords will use these data to set new rent prices. The rent increase will be influenced by the monthly and yearly inflation rates. According to the latest data from TÜIK, the consumer price index (TÜFE) has increased by 49.38% annually and 2.97% monthly. This data will directly affect the new rent prices that tenants will have to pay. The expectation is that the rent increase for November will be similar to the 12-month TÜFE rate of 63.47% announced last month. Both tenants and landlords should be careful and follow the inflation data during this process.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 02, 2024 12:00 PM\nSource:[kamuajans.net](https://www.kamuajans.net/ekonomi/2024-kasim-kira-artis-orani-ne-zaman-belli-olacak-604718)\n\n**California Rent Hike: What You Need to Know and How to Protect Yourself**\nStarting November 1, renters in some California counties will face higher rent prices, potentially exceeding 8.9%. The increases will be based on 50% of the local Consumer Price Index, which may lead to some landlords taking advantage of the price hike. In areas like Los Angeles and Orange, new legal limits on rent increases have taken effect, so residents should be aware of the increases they will face. If notified of a rent increase on or after November 1, 2024, that exceeds the established limit, renters can turn to the California Tenant Protection Act for protection against eviction without a court order, discrimination, and retaliation. According to the legislation, 'most renters are also protected against unjust eviction and large rent increases.' If abuse is detected, renters should know the three key points: 'La mayoría de los inquilinos también están protegidos contra el desalojo sin causa justa y grandes aumentos de alquiler', señala la legislación.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 09:00 PM\nSource:[RPP noticias](https://rpp.pe/usa/servicios/alquiler-en-california-2024-de-cuanto-es-el-incremento-y-como-protegerme-de-los-excesos-estados-unidos-rppusa-noticia-1591228)\n\n**US Rents Continue to Rise, but at a Slower Pace**\nAccording to Redfin, the average rent in the US increased by 0.6% in September, reaching $1634. This is in line with the trend of the past two years, where prices have remained within a range of $1599 to $1663. However, in 16 of the last 24 months, rents have been even more stable, between $1630 and $1650. Redfin's economist, Sheharyar Bokhari, noted that while rents have remained stable at a national level, the trend could be 'very different' depending on where you live. He explained that in areas with less construction, such as the East Coast and Midwest, rents are rising, while in cities with a high supply of new housing, such as those in the Sun Belt, rents are falling. The cities with the largest increases in rent were in the Midwest and East Coast, with Washington, D.C. experiencing a 12% increase. In contrast, Jacksonville, Florida, saw a 11.3% decrease in rent. Zillow reported that the increase in rent prices has slowed down due to a decrease in demand and an increase in inventory. Property managers are offering more concessions to attract tenants. Zillow estimated that prices will fall as new rentals enter the market. The Biden administration has proposed a law that would limit rent increases to 5% annually for landlords with more than 50 units. This would affect over 20 million rentals in the US. However, the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders have criticized the plan, saying it would infringe on property rights and discourage new construction.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 01:58 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN ÉPOCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/los-alquileres-de-viviendas-en-ee-uu-subiero-en-septiembre-1313095.html)\n\n**LA Renters Face Fierce Competition Amid Rising Rents and Limited Housing**\nThe rental market in Greater Los Angeles is becoming increasingly competitive, with soaring lease renewals and slower construction driving up competition and making it harder for renters to find new housing options. According to the Rental Market Competitiveness Report, Orange County is now California's hottest rental market, with a 95.5% occupancy rate and 12 renters competing per apartment. Eastern Los Angeles County has the highest occupancy rate at 96.0%, with 16 renters competing per apartment. In contrast, Western Los Angeles County has the lowest competitiveness score (64.9) and occupancy rate (92.3%).

Records Highest Level of Office Leasing Activity Since Early 2020**\nLos Angeles recorded its highest level of office leasing activity since early 2020, with 3.8 million square feet signed in the third quarter of 2024, a 27 percent boost year-over-year. The largest lease was signed by the Southern California Gas Company, which relocated to a smaller space. Despite this activity, availability rates in L.A. rose to 28.3 percent, driven by employers downsizing their office footprints. Average monthly asking rents remained consistent at $3.90 per square foot, but Class A office rents rose 1.7 percent year-over-year. The report notes that the rise in leasing activity has sparked cautious optimism that demand for office space is returning to L.A., but office-using employment growth in the region has turned negative. As the report states, 'Leasing activity will be very closely watched to see if the Los Angeles office market has turned the corner or if recovery is further away.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2024 08:42 PM\nSource:[Commercial Observer](https://commercialobserver.com/2024/10/la-office-leasing-activity-savills-report)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

According to Skylar Olsen, Zillow's chief economist, 'Buying a home in 2024 was surprisingly competitive given how high the affordability hurdle became. More inventory should shake loose in 2025, giving buyers a bit more room to breathe.' Zillow forecasts a 2.6% home value growth in 2025, with 4.3 million existing home sales. However, mortgage rates are expected to be volatile, with potential swings throughout the year. Additionally, Americans are shifting towards smaller homes and renting as a long-term lifestyle, with the term 'cozy' appearing in 35% more listing descriptions in 2024 compared to 2023.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2024 07:18 PM\nSource:[fox32chicago.com](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/housing-market-2025-will-look-like)\n\n**It’s a better time to be a renter in Denver as rates fall**\nThe vacancy rate for apartments in the metro Denver area has increased to 11% as of October, according to CoStar. This is roughly double the vacancy rate of a few years ago. As a result, apartment landlords are offering large concessions, including up to eight weeks of free rent, to fill up empty units. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in metro Denver is $1,686 per month, down 2.5% from a year ago. Landlords are also offering perks such as free internet and fresh flower deliveries to attract tenants. However, the good times may be over soon, as the number of apartments being built is way down this year, giving landlords room to raise rents again once they work through the backlog. According to Jeannie Tobin, director of market analytics for Denver at CoStar, 'Now is probably the best deal you’re going to get.

The decrease in rentals in Florida is mainly due to an increase in the supply of apartments, driven by the accelerated construction of residential units during the pandemic. As Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, notes, this increase in supply has moderated prices in the market. However, the economist warns that the price drop may not be sustained beyond 2025, as operational, maintenance, and administrative costs of buildings in Miami are increasing, which could limit future reductions in rentals. Although the price drop is welcome, not all tenants are seeing improvements in their purchasing power, as salaries have not grown at the same rate as inflation, forcing many people to cut expenses to cover their housing needs.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 24, 2024 01:30 PM\nSource:[RPP noticias](https://rpp.pe/usa/actualidad/alquileres-en-florida-por-esta-razon-los-precios-bajaron-en-el-estado-del-sol-estados-unidos-rppusa-noticia-1599901)\n\n**This housing market map shows Zillow’s revised 2025 home price forecast**\nZillow economists have revised their 2025 home price forecast, expecting a 2.9% increase in U.S. home prices between October 2024 and October 2025. They attribute this growth to low inventory, declining mortgage rates, and modest improvements in home sales indicators. However, they also note that modest increases in new listings and high mortgage rates will limit price growth. Zillow expects the strongest home price appreciation to occur in 10 areas, including Atlantic City, NJ (+6.5%), and the weakest in 10 areas, including Lake Charles, LA (-7.8%).

On the other hand, rent prices are expected to stay stable next year, with wage growth potentially outpacing rent growth, according to Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist at Zillow. Renters in the Sun Belt may see more deals on rentals, while renters in other areas may see higher rent increases.

However, rental prices, as reported by Zillow and Redfin, have not increased for the last year and a half, with the nationwide median asking rent down $53 from its all-time high in 2022. The author suggests that rent prices may start falling as existing home sale listings rise, and if mortgage rates head lower, the number of existing homes for sale will increase, further pressuring rent prices.

The demand for rentals has increased due to university students' housing needs, marriages, divorces, business purposes, and urban renewal. The imbalance in supply and demand, as well as opportunity price increases, have driven rent increases over the past 4 years. While inflation has increased by 433% over the same period, rent increases have reached 570%. According to real estate experts, approximately 8 million tenants are in the market, with 250,000 new tenants joining each year. However, the difficulty of accessing housing has made it challenging for many to become homeowners. TSKB Gayrimenkul Değerleme General Manager Makbule Yönel Maya said, 'I think the high rent increase rate will start to slow down, but we can expect a real decline in sales prices for a while.' Maya added, 'The pandemic has caused a significant increase in prices, and the amortization period has decreased from 20-25 years to 15-16 years. I think this is a precursor to the slowdown in rent increases we saw in the past two years. I expect the rent increases to calm down, and sales prices will also stabilize.' Gayrimenkul Değerleme Uzmanı Ahmet Büyükduman said, 'Over the past 4 years, inflation has increased by 433%, while rents have increased by 570%. This means that rents have increased by 26% in real terms. The demand for rentals is increasing due to university students' housing needs, marriages, and other factors. The market is growing at a rate of 3% per year, with 250,000 new tenants joining each year. The prices of homes are not accessible, and the monthly payments are high. If the demand continues to increase, prices will rise rapidly. Therefore, I strongly believe that rent increases will be upward, and I expect them to be slightly above inflation.' \nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 09:24 PM\nSource:[Dünya](https://www.dunya.com/sektorler/emlak/kiralar-son-4-yilda-yuzde-570-artti-haberi-752658)\n\n**November 2024 Rent Increase Rate Announced: 62.02% Maximum Increase**\nThe rent increase rate for November 2024 has been announced by TÜİK based on the October inflation figures.

This rate represents the highest possible increase limit for rent agreements between landlords and tenants, and is not legally allowed to exceed this rate. The new rate comes after the previous 25% rent increase limit expired in July 2024, and rent increases will now be calculated based on inflation rates. According to TÜİK data, the Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) increased by 2.88% in October, with a cumulative increase of 39.77% since December 2023.

Landlords and tenants in Yozgat are preparing to update their rent agreements based on these new rates. While the rent increases will bring more income to landlords, they will also increase the cost burden for tenants. Real estate experts in Yozgat believe that these rent increases will affect the economic balance of the city and may cause fluctuations in the real estate market.

The rate is based on the 2.88% inflation rate announced for October. According to the calculation, a rent of 15,000 TL would increase by 9,303 TL, resulting in a new monthly rent of 24,303 TL. The 25% rent increase limit, which ended on July 2, 2024, will no longer apply. As a result, tenants whose contracts expire in November will have their rent increases determined based on the 12-month TÜFE rate. The TÜFE rate will be the maximum rate that landlords can charge. Hazine and Maliye Minister Mehmet Şimşek stated that inflation expectations are improving, citing a decrease in inflation expectations among the public, the real sector, and market participants over the past five months.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 05:21 AM\nSource:[ahaber.com.tr](https://www.ahaber.com.tr/ekonomi/2024/11/04/kasim-ayi-kira-artis-orani-yuzde-kac-oldu-tuik-kasim-ayi-kira-zammi-ne-kadar-olacak-2024-tufe-konut-kirasi-hesaplama)\n\n**2024 November Rent Increase Rate to be Determined by October Inflation Data**\nThe expected rent increase for November 2024 will be determined by the TEFE and TÜFE indices. In the past two years, rent increases have been limited to 25%. Now that this policy has ended, everyone is wondering what the new rates will be. The inflation data for October will be announced on November 4, 2024 at 10:00, and this will determine the rent increase for November. Both tenants and landlords will use these data to set new rent prices. The rent increase will be influenced by the monthly and yearly inflation rates. According to the latest data from TÜIK, the consumer price index (TÜFE) has increased by 49.38% annually and 2.97% monthly. This data will directly affect the new rent prices that tenants will have to pay. The expectation is that the rent increase for November will be similar to the 12-month TÜFE rate of 63.47% announced last month. Both tenants and landlords should be careful and follow the inflation data during this process.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 02, 2024 12:00 PM\nSource:[kamuajans.net](https://www.kamuajans.net/ekonomi/2024-kasim-kira-artis-orani-ne-zaman-belli-olacak-604718)\n\n**Gen Z Renters Burdened by High Cost of Rent**\nA new report by Zillow and StreetEasy found that nearly 60% of Gen Z renters (ages 18-25) spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. This is a significant burden for many young people, with 3 out of 5 Gen Z renters feeling overwhelmed and stressed by the high cost of rent. 'This is something that shouldn't be normal,' said Kenny Lee, senior economist at StreetEasy. The rent is increasing faster than salaries in most US cities, with the worst affected being Gen Z renters in cities like San Diego, Los Angeles, and Sacramento, where the rent burden is over 75%. Cities in Florida are also among the worst, with 70% of Gen Z renters in Orlando, Miami, and Tampa facing a significant rent burden. However, some cities like Austin have seen a decrease in the rent burden, with Gen Z renters spending 50.6% of their income on rent in 2022, down from 69.2% a decade earlier. The situation is slightly better for Gen Z renters compared to millennials at the same age, according to Zillow. In 2012, 60.2% of millennials spent more than 30% of their income on rent, slightly higher than the 58.6% of Gen Z renters in the same situation. Overall, the situation is dire for many renters in the US, with half feeling overwhelmed by housing costs and spending more than 30% of their income on rent.

This means that those who currently pay $150,000 per month will have to pay approximately $490,000. The increase is lower than the 238% rise in October, due to a decrease in the inflation index. Tenant associations are on high alert due to the difficulties tenants face in paying rent, with many families having to cut back on essential expenses to afford housing.

This is one of the last increases under the old law, which was marked by the ICL. Despite the repeal of the law, existing contracts must be respected until their expiration date. For example, if someone started renting on November 1, 2023, and is due for their first annual update, they will see a 226.6% increase. If they were paying $150,000 per month last year, they will now pay $489,900 per month for the same apartment until November 2025.

This is in line with the trend of the past two years, where prices have remained within a range of $1599 to $1663. However, in 16 of the last 24 months, rents have been even more stable, between $1630 and $1650. Redfin's economist, Sheharyar Bokhari, noted that while rents have remained stable at a national level, the trend could be 'very different' depending on where you live. He explained that in areas with less construction, such as the East Coast and Midwest, rents are rising, while in cities with a high supply of new housing, such as those in the Sun Belt, rents are falling. The cities with the largest increases in rent were in the Midwest and East Coast, with Washington, D.C. experiencing a 12% increase. In contrast, Jacksonville, Florida, saw a 11.3% decrease in rent. Zillow reported that the increase in rent prices has slowed down due to a decrease in demand and an increase in inventory. Property managers are offering more concessions to attract tenants. Zillow estimated that prices will fall as new rentals enter the market. The Biden administration has proposed a law that would limit rent increases to 5% annually for landlords with more than 50 units. This would affect over 20 million rentals in the US. However, the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders have criticized the plan, saying it would infringe on property rights and discourage new construction.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 01:58 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN ÉPOCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/los-alquileres-de-viviendas-en-ee-uu-subiero-en-septiembre-1313095.html)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

Experts believe that the increasing supply of housing will continue to support buyers' purchasing intentions and provide more room for negotiation, maintaining the overall housing price growth trend. The National Association of Realtors reported that as of September 2024, there were 1.36 million unsold homes in the US, a 20% increase from the same period last year. The August S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index showed a 4.2% year-over-year increase, lower than the 4.8% in July, but still a record high for 15 consecutive months. The current housing price surge in the US is mainly due to the sharp rise in mortgage interest rates, causing homeowners with low-interest mortgages to abandon their plans to switch homes, leading to a severe imbalance between supply and demand, and ultimately driving up housing prices.

More inventory should shake loose in 2025, giving buyers a bit more room to breathe.' Zillow forecasts a 2.6% home value growth in 2025, with 4.3 million existing home sales. However, mortgage rates are expected to be volatile, with potential swings throughout the year.

Urban rental costs are expected to increase 4-5% next year, squeezing the budgets of prospective homebuyers. Tony Williams at Building Value said, 'The restriction in supply of rental properties is rising quickly and it is outpacing the shortage of supply in the housing market - and thus rents will outpace house prices axiomatically.' However, British homebuilders have witnessed signs of improvement in recent months, and 13 of 15 respondents believe affordability will improve over the coming year, thanks to more competitive mortgage rates.

However, rental prices, as reported by Zillow and Redfin, have not increased for the last year and a half, with the nationwide median asking rent down $53 from its all-time high in 2022. The author suggests that rent prices may start falling as existing home sale listings rise, and if mortgage rates head lower, the number of existing homes for sale will increase, further pressuring rent prices. When the CPI data catches up with reality, the author expects that CPI will run at 2% or even lower.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 11:50 AM\nSource:[Investing.com UK](https://uk.investing.com/analysis/the-real-cpi-may-already-be-at-2-200614507)\n\n**Housing market pauses for election**\nThe housing market experienced a pause due to the election, with inventory, new listings, sales, and prices all dipping this week. However, this is a common trend for the first week of November, and the market is expected to rebound before the end of the month. The current trends suggest that inventory and new listings will continue to grow, with a 28% increase in homes on the market compared to last year. New listings declined by 20% this week, but this is likely a one-week dip due to the election. The median price of single-family homes dropped by a couple of percent this week, but is still 4% above last year at $380,000. The data suggests that the market is shifting back into low sales mode, and a reversal of the sales growth trend is not off the table. However, the forecast for 2025 suggests continued growth in seller volume and home prices, with a trend of more sellers and greater inventory.

However, mortgage rates are approaching 7% again, which may define the remainder of 2024 and could impact the market in 2025. According to Shriram Villupuram, a real estate and finance professor at the University of Texas at Arlington, 'The weird factor comes in because, when interest rates go up and affordability goes down, prices should go down, but we’re not a normal market.' Despite this, Villupuram believes the market still favors sellers, but notes that mortgage rates are 'flattening the home price.' The median price of a D-FW home was $399,000 in October, up 2.5% from last year, and there were more than 30,200 active listings, a 37% jump from last year.

The article cites data from Redfin, which shows that new listings have increased by 15.3% in Washington D.C., 15.1% in San Francisco, and 14.3% in Seattle compared to last year. These cities, along with New York and Baltimore, are experiencing a surge in new listings, which is expected to continue into the new year. However, some cities, such as Austin, Texas, and Atlanta, are experiencing a decline in new listings. The article also highlights the four main reasons for the lack of new housing construction in the US: high land costs, labor shortages, excessive regulations, and 'not-in-my-backyard' (NIMBY) attitudes.

This change is driven by several factors, including an increase in housing supply, a moderate slowdown in price growth, and ongoing economic factors. Several factors are influencing the current market trend: interest rates, economic uncertainty, population growth, and a strong job market. The market is now exhibiting characteristics of both a buyer's market and a seller's market. The buyer's market features increased inventory, fewer bidding wars, and slightly lower prices. The seller's market is supported by a strong job market and ongoing population growth, as well as relatively low inventory levels. The market's specific characteristics vary depending on the sub-area and location. It is recommended to conduct a detailed analysis of the specific area and price range of interest and consult with local real estate professionals for the latest market information. Different price ranges have different sales data, with the low price range (under $150,000) showing significant fluctuations, the mid-range ( $250,000 to $400,000) remaining the most active market, and the high-end market (over $750,000) showing a decrease in median price despite an increase in sales volume. Inventory months increase with price range, with high-end properties staying on the market longer. The average sales time for Dallas homes increased to 86 days in September 2024, up from 76 days in September 2023. In summary, the Dallas real estate market is undergoing a transformative phase, transitioning from a strong seller's market to a more balanced market. Inventory is increasing, and prices are showing a moderate slowdown, providing opportunities for buyers and sellers to participate in the market with more strategy. The Dallas economy remains strong, with a stable job market and ongoing population growth supporting the real estate market. However, buyers and sellers need to be aware of various factors influencing the market, including interest rates, economic uncertainty, and new home construction.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 22, 2024 04:43 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/24/11/22/n14376045.htm)\n\n**Home sales jumped in October, and housing demand is set to pick up from here, NAR says**\nThe National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported a 3.4% increase in existing home sales in October, marking the first annual rise since July 2021.

However, buyers are still challenged by affordability issues, with the median existing home price climbing 4% to $407,200 in October, marking the 16th-straight month of price increases. Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, stated, 'The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions.' Despite elevated mortgage rates, Yun expects them to stabilize.

This trend is most pronounced in Texas, Florida, and the New Orleans metro, where buyers currently have an edge in negotiations. Zillow's chief economist, Skylar Olsen, stated, 'We're seeing competition among buyers fade, with mortgage rates climbing back toward 7% as we move closer to the usual winter slowdown.' Olsen added, 'Inventory is still slowly building back up and price cuts are still relatively common — persistent buyers may be able to find a deal or negotiate for worthwhile concessions.'

The report states that the low inventory of houses and the expected decrease in mortgage interest rates are driving the price increase. Redfin's senior economist Sheharyar Bokhari said, 'Many people, especially first-time homebuyers, have been waiting for the election to end before making a decision to buy a house. Now that the election is over, we're seeing a rebound in homebuying demand, and in the next few months, we expect to see even more competition for homes, unless the number of available homes increases significantly, in which case, home prices may continue to rise.' Zillow's recent report predicts that home prices will increase by 2.6% this year and 2.8% in the next 12 months. The report attributes the price increase to low inventory and the expected decrease in mortgage interest rates. However, if mortgage interest rates rise and inventory increases slightly, it may limit the price increase.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 11:48 PM\nSource:[www.ntdtv.com](https://www.ntdtv.com/b5/2024/11/20/a103931240.html)\n\n**Cities with highest share of affordable home listings: How Denver compares**\nA recent analysis by Zillow found that the share of affordable homes in the US has increased to 28% in September, the highest level since February 2023. However, this relief may be short-lived as mortgage rates have ticked up again, with the average 30-year mortgage rate at 6.78% last week. According to Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist for Zillow, 'Buyers should expect more ups and downs ahead for mortgage rates.' The share of affordable homes varies from market to market, with Austin, Texas seeing the biggest rise in affordable listings, increasing from 13% in October 2023 to 26% in October 2024. In Denver, 22.9% of home listings in October 2024 were considered affordable, slightly down from September 2024's 23%.

The Zillow Market Heat Index indicates that the competition nationwide is approaching a buyer's market, as activity slows down for the winter. However, Dallas, Houston, and Miami are among the top 10 most expensive cities in the US, according to Zillow's price indices. 'We're seeing the competition between buyers fade away, with mortgage rates rising back to 7% as we approach the typical winter slowdown,' said Skylar Olsen, Zillow's chief economist. The inventory is still slowly accumulating, and price cuts are still relatively common - persistent buyers can find a deal or negotiate concessions worth the effort, Olsen added. The seasonal trends in inventory are local, and decisions to move by buyers and sellers may not be as hindered by the winter time in Southern states, for example. With the current persistence of high housing prices and the mortgage environment, the competition between buyers has a lot to do with the available inventory. Each of the 13 major markets where buyers currently have an advantage are among the top 20 nationally in terms of inventory recovery compared to pre-pandemic levels. The reduced competition translates to lower home appreciation. Monthly home value declines are greater in Austin, Dallas, Atlanta, Tampa, and San Antonio. The average number of days an ad stays on the market has increased more in Southern markets compared to before the pandemic. The national inventory is still on a long path of recovery from a deficit that developed at the beginning of the pandemic; it now sits approximately 28% below pre-pandemic norms for this time of year, the smallest deficit since September 2020 and a significant improvement from the 36% deficit recorded in March, the lowest of 2024. New construction is another piece of the puzzle. In cases where builders have been able to keep up with demand, the balance is returning to markets, and home price appreciation and rent growth have generally flattened. The relief from lower mortgage rates in September was brief. The relief that homebuyers felt in September due to the drop in mortgage rates was brief. Mortgage rates rose again in October, returning some of the gains in affordability. Mortgage payments for a typical home increased by 2.8% intermonthly in October, after four consecutive months of declines. However, monthly mortgage payments (with a 20% down payment) have decreased by more than $100 per month compared to the May peak and are $179 less than in October last year.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 05:09 PM\nSource:[fundssociety.com](https://www.fundssociety.com/es/noticias/mercados/la-competencia-por-la-vivienda-disminuye-mas-rapidamente-en-florida-y-texas/)\n\n**Competition for homes easing fastest in Florida, Texas - Zillow Gr (NASDAQ:Z), Zillow Gr (NASDAQ:ZG)**\nAccording to Zillow's market report, competition for homes is easing across the nation, with more markets tilting in favor of buyers.

Experts believe that the increasing supply of housing will continue to support buyers' purchasing intentions and provide more room for negotiation, maintaining the overall housing price growth trend. The National Association of Realtors reported that as of September 2024, there were 1.36 million unsold homes in the US, a 20% increase from the same period last year. The August S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index showed a 4.2% year-over-year increase, lower than the 4.8% in July, but still a record high for 15 consecutive months. The current housing price surge in the US is mainly due to the sharp rise in mortgage interest rates, causing homeowners with low-interest mortgages to abandon their plans to switch homes, leading to a severe imbalance between supply and demand, and ultimately driving up housing prices.

This rise is attributed to the strengthening economy, particularly in the labor market, which has placed upward pressure on interest rates. Despite expectations that rates might ease in 2025, many experts are cautious, citing the robust job market and high consumer spending. Homebuyers and those looking to refinance should consider their unique financial situations and weigh the costs and benefits of refinancing, as current rates are higher than previous months.

Trump wrote on his media platform 'Truth Social', 'Jimmy Patronis is the current Florida State Treasurer, who has also served as the state fire chief and a key member of the Florida Cabinet. I've heard that Jimmy is considering running for Congress in Florida's 1st Congressional District.' 'He has always been a good friend of mine and 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA). As your next Congressman, Jimmy will work with me to develop our economy, protect our border security, stop immigration crimes, strengthen our incredible military/ veterans, restore America's energy dominance, and defend our Second Amendment, which has been under attack.' Trump concluded, 'If he decides to run, I fully support him. Run, Jimmy, run!' Trump announced his nomination of Gaetz as Attorney General on November 13, and Gaetz resigned from his congressional seat the same day. On November 22, Gaetz withdrew from the Attorney General election and stated he would not return to Congress. Patronis seems to be ready to accept the suggestion. On Monday afternoon, he posted on social media, 'Let me get to work, Mr. President!... I'm here to serve.' Monday was a crucial day. Any elected official interested in running for the special election to fill Gaetz's seat must submit their resignation by Monday. Currently, two Florida state representatives and one local elected official have expressed plans to run. Before the 2026 election, Gaetz's congressional seat will be filled by a person chosen by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. State Senator Joe Gruters, a longtime ally of Trump, has announced his intention to run for state treasurer, but has had conflicts with DeSantis. The question is whether DeSantis will appoint someone who has opposed him to fill the position. Additionally, Lara Trump, the daughter-in-law of Trump, has expressed interest in being appointed to the Senate seat left vacant by Marco Rubio. Trump nominated Rubio for Secretary of State, and Rubio's Senate seat will be filled by DeSantis until the next election in two years. Patronis, a well-known restaurateur in Panama City, Florida, was appointed state treasurer by then-Governor Rick Scott in 2017 and has been a strong ally of Scott. He supported Scott in his first gubernatorial campaign, defeating the majority of the Republican establishment's candidate. Patronis does not reside in Gaetz's congressional district, but he is well-known in the area. Before Trump expressed his support for Patronis, he posted on social media over the weekend, publicly endorsing state Senator Randy Fine to run for the congressional seat left vacant by Mike Waltz. Trump chose Waltz as his next National Security Adviser. Trump's public statement may increase pressure on Governor DeSantis to choose a candidate to fill the congressional and other positions.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 25, 2024 10:41 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/24/11/25/n14378581.htm)\n\n**Who Should DeSantis Appoint to Replace Rubio?

According to Box Office Guru founder and editor Gitesh Pandya, this is exactly what the box office needed this year, citing the pandemic and double strikes as major disruptions. Pandya notes that the outlook for the fourth quarter and 2025 is good, and with Disney's 'Moana 2' coming out this week, he predicts that the Thanksgiving box office will be the 'biggest in over a decade'. 'Wicked' did 'fantastic', and 'Gladiator II' did 'really well', with good reviews and audience metrics. Pandya believes that this will lead to a strong holiday season, with people coming back to the theaters to see upcoming releases.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2024 05:05 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

According to the article, 'Wicked' has the potential to enter the top 10, which would be a 'small glimmer of hope for Hollywood'. However, it's worth noting that the movie will be released in two parts, which may not exempt it from being part of the sequel trend.

'Wicked' got off to a hot start, surpassing Disney's 'Into the Woods' as the biggest opening weekend for a musical adaptation of a Broadway show, while 'Gladiator II' set a record as the biggest November opening day for an R-rated film. Dergarabedian credits the year's success to the diversity in genres and the industry's ability to rebound from the SAG-AFTRA strikes.

However, two star-studded films, Wicked and Gladiator 2, are expected to reverse the trend and generate excitement in theaters before the holidays. Gladiator 2 is already in theaters, while Wicked is set to release on Thursday, November 21, with early access screenings on Wednesday. According to Deadline, Wicked is projected to earn $100 million in its opening weekend, a significant increase from the previous forecast of $80-85 million in its first three days. Meanwhile, Variety estimates that Gladiator 2 will earn $65 million in its opening weekend in the US, while Deadline projects $55-65 million. Gladiator 2 has already earned $87 million in international markets, in line with Deadline's projections. Wicked has secured the second-best pre-sale ticket sales for a film this year, behind only Deadpool & Wolverine, the second-highest-grossing film of the year. The 2024 box office has been a rollercoaster, with few successes and more high-budget flops. While films like Dune 2 and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire stood out in the early months, big-budget failures like Profession: Danger and Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga failed to turn a profit with budgets over $150 million. The industry performed better in winter, thanks to the three biggest hits of the year: Intensely 2, Deadpool & Wolverine, and My Favorite Villain 4. However, spring brought another challenging time for the box office, as expected hits like Joker: Folie à Deux and Venom: The Last Dance failed to meet projections, and the top-grossing film of the past weekend, Code: Red Suit, earned only $34 million with a $250 million budget. The top 10 films in the US did not exceed $100 million in a single weekend in September, a feat achieved every weekend between mid-June and mid-August. Wicked and Gladiator 2 are being compared to the Barbenheimer phenomenon of last year, when Barbie and Oppenheimer dominated the winter box office, becoming the number 1 and number 3 highest-grossing films of the year, respectively. 'It won't happen the same way, but the conversation around Wicked and Gladiator reminds me of Barbenheimer,' said Shawn Robbins, director of cinematic analysis at Fandango, noting that the films are 'feeding off each other.' Tom Nunan, a film professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told CNN that the two films 'will feed off each other,' but likely won't have the same momentum as Barbenheimer, citing Wicked's limited appeal as a musical and the stories being familiar to the audience. Paul Mescal, the star of Gladiator 2, compared the two films to the Barbenheimer phenomenon, dubbing the double feature of this year 'Glicked.' Wicked and Gladiator 2 are expected to receive Oscar nominations for Best Picture, with many publications, including Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, and Entertainment Weekly, predicting that Wicked will lead the pack with nine nominations. Wicked features a star-studded cast, including Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, and is directed by Jon M. Chu. Gladiator 2 is directed by Ridley Scott and stars Paul Mescal, Denzel Washington, and Pedro Pascal. The box office is expected to continue its recovery next week with the release of Moana 2, which is projected to be one of the highest-grossing animated films of the year. Deadline predicts that Moana 2 could eclipse the success of Intensely 2, the highest-grossing film of the year. The CEO of AMC, Adam Aron, said in a quarterly earnings presentation earlier this month that 'experts believe Moana 2 could surpass even the success of Intensely 2.' Between Moana 2 and the second weekend of Wicked and Gladiator 2, Deadline expects the next weekend to be the highest-grossing in the US.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 05:03 PM\nSource:[forbes.com.ec](https://www.forbes.com.ec/negocios/podra-gladiador-2-revertir-presente-hollywood-numeros-entusiasman-industria-n62957)\n\n**Box Office Score Card: Frozen II’s $130M Debut Weekend Rules At #1 – Top 5 Highest-Grossing ‘Thanksgiving’ Debut Weekends!**\nDisney's Frozen II holds the record for the biggest 5-day opening weekend over the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States and Canada, with a debut of $130M.

With a current domestic box office revenue of $6,802,253,425, 2024 is projected to finish under 2023's year-end total of $8,908,478,987. Several upcoming releases, including Gladiator II, Wicked: Part One, and Moana 2, may help boost the domestic box office, but it's unlikely they will make up the $2 billion deficit.

Retailers partnering with Universal are expected to see a boost from sales of 'Wicked' merchandise, which could help them stand out from other companies. The limited-time nature of these merchandise collaborations may also drive demand, as consumers may be willing to spend to get these products before they vanish from shelves. Movie theaters are also offering themed merchandise, such as popcorn buckets and drink specials, to capitalize on the film's release.

According to Shawn Robbins, Fandango's director of movie analytics, 'Wicked' and 'Gladiator II' are 'fueling each other', much like the 'Barbenheimer' phenomenon. The films are projected to open solidly, with 'Wicked' aiming for $80 million to $85 million, 'Gladiator II' looking to bring in $55 million to $65 million, and 'Moana 2' likely targeting above $100 million.

The film's poor reception, as indicated by a 38% Rotten Tomatoes score and 37% audience score, has led to a significant drop in tracking numbers. The film's marketing campaign has been criticized for hiding its musical elements and co-lead nature of Joaquin Phoenix's Joker and Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn. A worst-case scenario could see the film's total gross at around $300 million, while a more moderate outcome could put it at around $600 million. However, this would still be a significant disappointment compared to the original Joker's billion-dollar performance. The film's success will depend on its international performance, particularly in China, and its ability to maintain a strong word-of-mouth.

The assessment, published on November 20, also includes approvals for 25 landings of the Super Heavy booster for the spacecraft and the upper stage at the same site, using the 'food tray' capture mechanism in the launch tower. According to a report by Space, SpaceX may receive FAA approval to launch 25 Starship spacecraft in 2025. The Starship spacecraft, which is recognized as the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, is central to the company's vision for human exploration of the moon and Mars. The spacecraft is 400 feet tall and is designed for full reusability, and has been launched six times so far, all from the Starbase facility. During its recent mission on November 19, 2024, the mission was successful, although a communication failure forced the booster to make a controlled landing in the Gulf of Mexico instead of returning to the launch tower. The FAA's draft assessment, which defines these expanded operational capabilities, is still in its initial stage. Public consultations will take place in January, with four in-person meetings in southern Texas on January 7 and 9, as well as a virtual session on January 13.

The launches will take place from the Starbase launch site in Boca Chica, Texas. The FAA has also approved 25 landings of the two Starship elements - the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft - back at Starbase. SpaceX will use a special launch crane to 'catch' the booster, as it did successfully in mid-October. Although the next attempt was unsuccessful, the booster was landed on water. SpaceX is developing the largest rocket with a spacecraft to transport people to the Moon and Mars in the future. The 122-meter-long Starship is designed for reuse. In the future, SpaceX plans to conduct multiple Starship launches per day. All six test flights of Starship have taken place from Starbase, with the last one occurring in late November. The FAA has scheduled four in-person public hearings on January 7 and 9, 2025, and one virtual meeting on January 13. In March 2025, SpaceX plans to begin orbital testing of fuel transfer between two Starships. The company aims to use the Starship to launch Starlink V3 satellites into orbit. Additionally, in 2025, SpaceX is expected to launch the Starship with the Raptor 3 engine.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 22, 2024 01:36 PM\nSource:[Хабр](https://habr.com/ru/news/860614/)\n\n**SpaceX fails to repeat Starship booster catch, as Trump watches on**\nSpaceX's latest test flight of its Starship megarocket was unsuccessful in catching the descending first stage, despite President-elect Donald Trump's presence at the event.

According to Elon Musk, the head of SpaceX, a malfunction occurred on the ground infrastructure, not on the rocket itself, during the November 20, 2024 launch. The launch pad's tower lost contact with the mission control center shortly after the Starship spacecraft separated from the Super Heavy first stage, as Musk wrote on X. As a result, the command was given to steer the first stage towards the Gulf of Mexico for a controlled splashdown. It's possible that the stage could have been caught by the tower in autonomous mode, but SpaceX decided not to take the risk. The recovery of the first stage of Super Heavy has already been successful, during the fifth test flight. However, the attempt was almost a failure, but it was successful in the end. The incident led to a software update for the first stage's equipment, which was intended to be tested during the sixth test flight. However, the ground infrastructure failed this time. The sixth test flight was still successful in its mission, providing valuable data on the dynamics of the Starship spacecraft's descent at subsonic speeds during the final stage of the flight before splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This data will help later to organize the capture of the Starship spacecraft by the launch pad's tower. However, at least one more test flight, the seventh, will take place before that. In this flight, the spacecraft will be larger and have a slightly different layout of the flaps. If the new version of the spacecraft shows a successful splashdown on the same side of the Earth as all previous flights, SpaceX may attempt to recover the Starship spacecraft and catch it in the air during the eighth flight, which is expected to take place in early 2025.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 21, 2024 06:22 PM\nSource:[3DNews - Daily Digital Digest](https://3dnews.ru/1114392/povodom-dlya-zatopleniya-raketi-super-heavy-vo-vremya-poslednego-zapuska-starship-stal-razriv-kanala-svyazi-s-kompyuterom-bashni-obslugivaniya)\n\n**SpaceX's Starship Test Fails to Meet Expectations, Despite Presence of Elon Musk and Donald Trump**\nThe SpaceX Starship, the largest rocket ever built by the company, conducted a new test on November 19, 2023, in Boca Chica, Texas. The test, which was attended by Elon Musk and US President-elect Donald Trump, did not achieve the same success as the previous launch. The rocket, weighing 5,000 tons, carried a novel feature: a banana-shaped cushion used for gravity-related tests. According to Musk, 'I want someone who looks at me the way Trump looks at Elons Starship.' The test was the sixth conducted by the company in 2023. The Heavy Booster separated from the rocket at an altitude of 68 kilometers and landed in the Gulf of Mexico, but failed to return to the launch base. The Starship landed in the Indian Ocean after an hour of flight, but the company still needs to refine the reusability of the propulsor. SpaceX has already successfully completed a flight with the recovery of the propulsor, but the first attempts only returned to Earth without using the recovery platform. Reusability is essential for reducing costs and making future missions, including those to Mars, feasible.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 01:19 PM\nSource:[diariocarioca.com](https://www.diariocarioca.com/mundo/trump-e-elon-musk-acompanham-teste-da-spacex-com-falha-no-foguete-starship/)\n\n**Starship Test Ends in Failure, But Successful Water Landing**\nSpaceX, the space exploration company founded by Elon Musk, conducted a new test for its Starship spacecraft on November 19.

The test aimed to repeat the 'chopstick-grabbing-rocket' maneuver, but it was not successful. However, the Starship did successfully relight its Raptor engines in space, a feat that was first attempted in March but failed due to high roll rates. The test also carried a banana as a payload, which was a nod to the internet meme 'banana scale'. The Starship is expected to undergo a major upgrade for its seventh flight test, which will include a new propulsion system, improved heat shields, and a redesigned nose fairing. SpaceX aims to conduct 25 Starship launches in 2025, a goal that some consider overly ambitious. However, with the potential for relaxed regulatory environment under the new US administration, SpaceX may be able to achieve this goal.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 03:39 AM\nSource:[东方财富网](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202411203245317081.html)\n\n**SpaceX's Starship Fails to Recover First Stage in Latest Test Flight**\nSpaceX's Starship failed to recover its first stage with mechanical arms during its sixth test flight, despite the encouragement of Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

The largest rocket in history took off at 19h (Brasília time) from Starbase, the company's installation in Boca Chica, Texas, USA. The first stage, the Super Heavy propellant, separated from the second, the Starship spacecraft, about three minutes after launch and then began maneuvers to return to the platform. However, unlike last month, telemetry data sent by the first stage led the company to decide not to bring the Super Heavy to the mechazilla, a structure developed to catch the propellant in the air. Instead, the rocket descended, as planned in case of contingency, in a controlled manner into the ocean. The second stage continued its suborbital trajectory, passing about an hour in space and making more than half a turn around the Earth, in an effort to push the envelope and establish higher limits for its operations. The spacecraft activated one of its Raptor engines in space, a first for the program. The landing, which was successful, was recorded by cameras on board and in nearby buoys, producing beautiful live images transmitted by SpaceX on its X social network account. This was the last flight with the original Starship model, which has undergone hundreds of mission improvements mission by mission. From the seventh flight, the updates will be more notable, including redesigned front flaps, larger propellant tanks, the new generation of thermal protection tiles, and secondary thermal protection layers. The goal is to develop a fully reusable thermal protection system that will enable rapid recovery and preparation of the Starship for new flights. The program still needs to demonstrate several technologies before the rocket can be used for human transportation to the lunar surface, as the NASA wants for the Artemis 3 mission, scheduled for the end of 2026 (with possible delay to 2027 or 2028).\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 07:09 PM\nSource:[uol.com.br](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ciencia/2024/11/em-novo-teste-spacex-desiste-de-capturar-starship-com-braco-robotico.shtml)\n\n**ispace and SpaceX Postpone Lunar Module Launch to January 2025**\nispace, a global company focused on lunar research, has released its financial results for the second quarter, which ended on March 31, 2024.

'We found some things that we just couldn't feel comfortable putting ourselves back in the Starliner when we had other options,' said Wilmore. 'We wanted to take the Starliner to the end and land back home, but you know, there's a time to move on and look to the next opportunity,' added Williams. The two astronauts will remain in space for over 8 months and will not return until February 2025. This incident highlights the challenges faced by Boeing in developing its Starliner spacecraft, which has been plagued by technical issues since 2014. 'It was a successful landing,' said Steve Stich, NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, but acknowledged that new problems had arisen, including a failed new propulsor and temporary loss of the guidance system. 'It's too early to say if the next Starliner flight, scheduled for August 2025, will carry a crew,' Stich added. 'We need time to analyze the data and evaluate the changes needed, both in the spacecraft design and its environment.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 28, 2024 11:00 AM\nSource:[El Deber](https://eldeber.com.bo/mundo/si-el-huracan-elene-lo-permite-hoy-space-x-lanza-la-nave-que-rescatara-a-los-astronautas-varados-des_386171)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

    "news": "Here are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Temer: Brazil Not Prepared for 4-Day Workweek**\nFormer President Michel Temer stated on Monday (25) that Brazil is not prepared for a 4-day workweek and 3-day weekend schedule. He believes that Brazilians are not concerned about this and that people would look for another job to occupy the three days off. Temer said, 'I think Brazil is not yet prepared for this [4-day workweek]. It's not possible. I remember in 1997, 1998, when I was first president of the Chamber, there was a movement to reduce working hours from 44 to 40 hours. It lasted almost a year, but didn't work out. I even proposed reducing it to 42 hours, but it wasn't possible.' According to Temer, the measure would be 'unhelpful' for the national business sector, as it would heavily burden companies. He also stated, 'This 4-day workweek won't work in Brazil. I don't think it's the right time to think about it. I don't even think workers are concerned about it. If it happens, I think workers will find another job for the other three days,' Temer said.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 25, 2024 04:57 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2024/11/brasil-nao-esta-preparado-para-jornada-4x3-e-trabalhador-nem-liga-para-isso-diz-temer.shtml)\n\n**The 6x1 Workday: A Disguised Slave Regime that Affects Women**\nThe proposal to end the 6x1 workday has gained attention in Brazil, after a growing pressure on social media and organized protests by social movements. The proposal was finally sent to the National Congress. However, the reality is that the 6x1 workday should have been abolished much earlier. The 6x1 workday is a disguised slave regime that takes away the fundamental right of workers to have a healthy, balanced, and dignified life. There is no time for self-care, studying, resting, hobbies, or even being with family. This workload overload is not just a matter of time, but of quality of life. The arguments that eliminating this model would compromise the economy are false, just like the case of the CLT or the 13th salary. According to IBGE data, around 11 million single mothers live in Brazil, who often have to work incessantly to support their children, but end up not being able to offer the attention and care that children need. This problem is even more serious for single mothers, who represent a significant portion of women in Brazil. The PEC that puts an end to the 6x1 workday is not just a change in the work regime, but an opportunity to reverse a structure of exploitation and ensure that women can seek a balance between their professional and personal lives. Quality of life should be the priority, not excessive work. This is a cause that involves the entire society, but directly affects women, who have been overloaded with the double workday.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 25, 2024 04:33 PM\nSource:[uol.com.br](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/ana-fontes/2024/11/a-perspectiva-das-mulheres-no-debate-da-jornada-6x1.shtml)\n\n**Brazil Postpones New Rules on Sunday and Holiday Work in Commerce Sector**\nThe Brazilian government has announced the postponement of new rules on working on Sundays and holidays in the commerce sector, originally planned for 2024, to 2025. The decision highlights the challenges of balancing the demands of employers, workers, and union representatives in a context where the 2021 norm, which exempted union intervention, generated controversy. The extension of the implementation deadline emphasizes the importance of dialogue and articulation among the different stakeholders to promote legislation that is fair to all sectors. The new rules aim to provide workers with more rest and time for their personal lives, which may result in higher job satisfaction and lower absenteeism rates. However, they may also increase costs for companies, particularly those that rely on weekend and holiday work, and require restructuring of operations. The implementation of the new rules is expected to intensify negotiations between unions and companies, seeking to find a balance between workers' rights and business needs.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 25, 2024 11:24 AM\nSource:[terrabrasilnoticias.com](https://terrabrasilnoticias.com/2024/11/trabalho-aos-domingos-e-feriados-em-2025-novas-regras-trazem-mudancas-e-brasileiros-comemoram/)\n\n**Gisela Simona Supports PEC Vida Além do Trabalho, Advocates for Broad Debate**\nFederal Deputy Gisela Simona (União Brasil) supports the PEC Vida Além do Trabalho, which aims to end the 6x1 work schedule and replace it with a 4x3 schedule. She advocates for a broad debate with the Federal Government, parliamentarians, the business sector, industries, and workers to find a 'middle ground'. According to Simona, the current 6x1 model is 'exhausting' for Brazilians, but any change must be carefully considered to avoid harming the country's economy. She suggests that a 5x2 schedule might be more acceptable, but notes that any reduction in working hours must be balanced with measures to avoid negative impacts on businesses and employment. 'We need to find a way for Brazil to find the best solution,' Simona said. 'The 6x1 schedule is exhausting, but there's a fear that a 4x3 schedule could burden businesses and lead to unemployment, which we don't want.' The proposal has been criticized by right-wing parliamentarians, who see it as an attempt to 'lock in' and gain national visibility. Simona believes that the PEC will undergo adjustments to avoid any imbalance and that discussions may drag on.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 25, 2024 11:05 AM\nSource:[poconet.com.br](https://www.poconet.com.br/noticia/ler/gisela-apoia-pec-do-fim-da-escala-6x1-e-defende-amplo-debate-por-consenso/43604)\n\n**Brazilian Workers Demand a Shorter Workweek: A Proposal to Abolish the 6x1 Schedule**\nA proposed constitutional amendment (PEC) by federal deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL-SP) aims to abolish the 6x1 work schedule, which consists of six days of work and one day of rest. The PEC has already gathered the required number of signatures and will begin to be processed in the Chamber of Deputies. Some economists, such as Pedro Gomes, professor of economics at the University of London, argue that a four-day workweek would be more beneficial for the economy. However, many business leaders and politicians are opposed to the proposal, citing concerns that it would increase costs and lead to job losses. Supporters of the PEC, including Luiz Marinho, Minister of Labor and Employment, argue that the current 6x1 schedule is 'cruel' and that a shorter workweek would improve the lives of workers. 'It's a text that will bring dignity and quality of life to Brazilian workers,' said Erika Hilton.

In her speech, Rick Azevedo stated, 'The 6x1 work schedule is a slave-like, inhumane, exploitative system that ends the lives of workers, especially mothers.' Erika Hilton, a PSol deputy, emphasized the importance of the movement, saying, 'The struggle of the worker will bring down the 6x1 schedule in this country. It's not the politicians who will make this change, it's the workers.' The movement aims to reduce the work schedule to 36 hours a week without salary reduction and has already gained support from various politicians and social movements.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 16, 2024 04:06 AM\nSource:[Correio Braziliense](https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/economia/2024/11/6989778-vat-deve-organizar-mais-atos-pelo-fimdaescala6x1-ate-o-fim-do-ano.html)\n\n**Prohibiting the 6x1 work schedule is good for the country? YES**\nA debate about ending the 6x1 work schedule (six consecutive days of work followed by one day of rest) has mobilized millions of workers in Brazil. The proposal, led by federal deputy Luiza Erundina (PSOL-SP), aims to eliminate the exploitative model of work and has gained support from over 230 deputies. A petition organized by Rick Azevedo's Movimento Vida Além do Trabalho (VAT) has reached nearly 3 million signatures. According to a DataSenado survey, 51% of the population supports reducing the workday to four days without salary loss, and 67% see the relationship between quality of life and salaries as a major challenge. The proposal aims to address the unsustainable model of work that has led to financial losses of R$ 13 billion per year due to work-related accidents. Opponents argue that the reduction of the workday would negatively affect small and medium-sized employers, but Erundina argues that this is a 'purely economic' view that ignores the real impact on workers' lives, health, and professionalization.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 10:49 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/opiniao/2024/11/proibir-a-jornada-6x1-e-bom-para-o-pais-sim.shtml)\n\n**Brazilian Protesters Demand End to 6x1 Work Schedule**\nProtesters across the country gathered on Friday, November 15, to demand an end to the 6x1 work schedule, which consists of six days of work and one day of rest.

According to the VAT, the current 6x1 schedule is a major cause of physical and mental exhaustion among workers, as well as hindering their ability to spend time with family and friends, engage in physical activities, or pursue hobbies. With the added pressure from the protests, the number of deputies who have signed the proposal has increased from 60 to 134 in just one week.

The mobilization is led by the Movimento Vida Além do Trabalho (VAT), created by elected councilor Rick Azevedo (PSOL-RJ), and aims to support the Proposed Constitutional Amendment (PEC) that seeks to transform the work model in Brazil, allowing for a shorter and more balanced workday. According to Márcio Ayer, president of the Sindicato dos Comerciários do Rio de Janeiro, the end of the 6x1 schedule is necessary for the dignity and health of workers. 'The 6x1 schedule is incompatible with the dignity of workers, as it does not allow any possibility of balance between work, personal life, rest, and self-care,' he said. Adilson Araújo, president of the Central dos Trabalhadores e Trabalhadoras do Brasil (CTB), emphasizes that the end of the 6x1 schedule and the reduction of the weekly workday can bring significant benefits to the economy and society as a whole. 'This is a strategic objective that stimulates the economy, increases work productivity, and reduces the incidence of occupational diseases such as burnout,' he said. Experiences from other countries, such as the United Kingdom, show that a shorter workweek can be a viable solution for Brazil. 'We have seen that healthier and happier workers are more productive, which generates a virtuous cycle for the entire economy,' said Ayer. Erika Hilton highlights that the proposal seeks a four-day workweek, which, according to her, 'reflects a global movement towards more flexible work models for workers, recognizing the need to adapt to new market realities and demands for better quality of life for workers and their families.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 04:23 PM\nSource:[vermelho.org.br](https://vermelho.org.br/2024/11/13/mobilizacoes-pelo-fim-da-escala-6x1-marcam-feriado-da-proclamacao-da-republica/)\n\n**Proposal to End 6x1 Work Schedule Reaches Congress**\nA proposal to end the 6x1 work schedule, presented by Erika Hilton, has reached the minimum number of signatures required to be submitted to the Brazilian Congress.

Carlinhos Maia emphasized, 'No one is a slave to anyone, and employers need to understand that a happy employee is a productive one.' Felipe Neto criticized the Minister of Labor's stance on the issue, saying, 'It's shameful to wash your hands and say that this should be treated in conventions and agreements.' Valesca Popozuda stated, 'This schedule is detrimental to any human being's quality of life and mental health.' She also added, 'Those who are against the end of the 6x1 schedule should try working on Saturdays and Sundays for minimum wage and bringing their lunch from home.'

PEC proposes 4-day workweek and 36-hour limit**\nA proposal to end the 6x1 work schedule, where employees have only one day off, has been debated on social media, from Twitter to Instagram, and LinkedIn. However, this is not the only common work schedule in the Brazilian labor market today. The change in the weekly work schedule is proposed in a Constitutional Amendment Bill (PEC) initiated by federal deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL-SP), who adopted the banner of the Vida Além do Trabalho (VAT) movement, which gained strength on social media last year. The VAT was founded by Rick Azevedo, elected city councilor in Rio. The text suggests adopting a four-day workweek and reducing the legal limit of 44 hours of weekly work to 36 hours, without changing the maximum daily load of eight hours and without reducing salaries. Maria Lucia Benhame, a labor law attorney and specialist in Labor Law, explains that the 6x1 schedule mainly affects workers in the commerce and some service sectors, such as hotels, bars, and restaurants, with a 7h20 workday in six days and one day off. According to data from the General Registry of Employees and Unemployed (Caged), there are 10.5 million workers in the commerce sector alone, the second-largest employer in the country. However, in other sectors, there are specific schedules. The attorney details that in the industry, for example, schedules have become increasingly 'creative': 'I've seen factories with weekly schedules that alternate, with 6x3, 6x2, and 6x1, for example. And in the logistics sector, there are cases of 4x4 schedules, at the demand of the workers themselves.' In other sectors, the schedule is not by day, but by hours worked. This is the case of healthcare workers or security services, who often work 12 hours and have 36 hours off.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 03:00 AM\nSource:[globo.com](https://oglobo.globo.com/economia/noticia/2024/11/13/6x1-5x2-4x4-12x36-entenda-os-diferentes-tipos-de-escala-de-trabalho-que-ja-existem.ghtml)\n\n**Zema calls 6x1 work schedule discussion 'a waste of time'**\nMinas Gerais Governor Romeu Zema stated that the discussion about the 6x1 work schedule, which may be debated in the Brazilian Congress, is 'a waste of time' and 'dispensable'. Zema emphasized the importance of free negotiation between employers and employees, saying that the country is one of the most regulated in this regard. He also stated that 'nobody is forced to marry, to tolerate things they don't agree with. You should have contracts, case by case.' Zema believes that responsible people who fulfill their contracts are what matters, not laws. This statement follows the liberal economic line of his party. The discussion about the 6x1 work schedule has gained momentum in Brazil, particularly with the 'Vida Além do Trabalho' (Life Beyond Work) movement, which criticizes the schedule for causing exhaustion and affecting workers' health and well-being. The movement proposes more time off for workers to rest, have leisure time, spend time with family, and take care of their health. The proposal aims to abolish the 6x1 schedule and reduce the maximum working hours from 44 to 36 hours per week, with a four-day workweek.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 08:19 PM\nSource:[InfoMoney](https://www.infomoney.com.br/politica/zema-diz-que-debate-sobre-escala-6x1-e-perda-de-tempo/)\n\n**Brazil's '6x1' Work Schedule Under Fire as Proposals for 36-Hour Workweek Gain Momentum**\nThe '6x1' work schedule, where employees work 6 days a week and have 1 day off, has been a topic of debate in Brazil. The Vida Além do Trabalho (VAT) movement has been pushing for the end of this schedule, and a proposal for a 36-hour workweek with 4 days off has been presented to the National Congress. The proposal, presented by Deputy Erika Hilton, has gained 134 signatures in just one week, and is now close to the 171 signatures needed to begin the legislative process. The proposal aims to reduce the workload and improve the quality of life for employees, who are often forced to work long hours without adequate rest. Deputy Reginaldo Lopes has also presented a similar proposal, which would reduce the workweek from 44 to 36 hours over a period of 10 years. The debate around the 6x1 schedule has been ongoing for years, with some arguing that it is a form of 'prison' for workers, while others argue that it is necessary for the economy. The Central Única dos Trabalhadores (CUT) and the Central dos Sindicatos Brasileiros (CSB) have been advocating for the reduction of the workweek to 40 hours, while the Confederação Nacional do Comércio de Bens, Serviços e Turismo (CNC) has expressed concerns about the potential impact on businesses. 'The imposition of a reduction in working hours without a corresponding reduction in salaries will directly affect the operational costs of companies,' said the CNC. Deputy Amom Mandel has expressed concerns that the end of the 6x1 schedule could harm the economy, but is open to being convinced otherwise. 'The proposal is not for the end of the 6x1 schedule, but for the establishment of a 4-day workweek,' he said. '80% of formal jobs in Brazil come from micro or small businesses, my people.' Minister of Labor and Employment Luiz Marinho has defended the idea of treating the 6x1 schedule in collective bargaining agreements, where employers and workers negotiate the terms of the contract. 'The ministry considers that a reduction in working hours to 40 hours per week is fully possible and healthy, when resulting from collective decision-making,' he said. 'The MTE has been following the debate closely and understands that this is a topic that requires the involvement of all sectors in a detailed and in-depth discussion, considering the specific needs of each area.' \nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 07:30 PM\nSource:[diariodepernambuco.com.br](https://www.diariodepernambuco.com.br/noticia/politica/2024/11/fim-da-6x1-cresce-pressao-popular-pela-aprovacao-da-pec.html)\n\n**Alckmin says 6x1 work schedule reduction is 'a trend worldwide'**\nBrazilian Vice President Geraldo Alckmin stated that the reduction in the 6x1 work schedule, with six days of work and one day of rest, is 'a trend worldwide'.

He noted that 'As technology advances, you can do more with fewer people and have a shorter workday'. However, Alckmin emphasized that the Brazilian government has not yet discussed the proposal to abolish the 6x1 schedule. He also stated that 'this is a debate that belongs to society and the Parliament', without clarifying whether the government will support or oppose the proposal made by federal deputy Erika Hilton, which aims to reduce the weekly working hours from 44 to 36.

The proposal, led by Erika Hilton (PSOL), aims to reduce the weekly work hours from 44 to 36 hours, without changing the 8-hour daily schedule. This would provide more quality of life and balance between personal and professional life for workers. The PEC has already gathered more than half of the necessary signatures, with notable signatories including Tabata Amaral (PSB-SP), André Janones (Avante-MG), and Duda Salabert (PDT-MG). According to Tabata Amaral, she decided to sign the proposal after discussing it with her team, saying, 'Before signing or presenting any project, I analyze with my team its economic and social impacts. It's my way of working, and it wasn't different with the PEC against the 6x1 scale.' André Janones emphasized the need for more deputies to sign the PEC, stating, 'The 6x1 scale is anti-human. People stop existing, they don't have a day to go to the cinema, read a book, dedicate themselves to their family, play with their children, or walk a dog. Life becomes working to exist, and existence becomes work.' Duda Salabert also called for the end of the 6x1 scale and more dignity for workers, saying, 'I was one of the first parliamentarians to sign the PEC to end the 6x1 shift because I believe that human dignity should come before profit. In the current scale, the worker has only 1 day of rest per week. This is unacceptable.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 11:08 AM\nSource:[terra.com.br](https://www.terra.com.br/noticias/brasil/politica/erika-hilton-tabata-amaral-e-andre-janones-veja-quais-deputados-ja-assinaram-a-pec-contra-a-escala-6x1,809fef775396785312baf6d21d3cb747dt2l9tgj.html)\n\n**Proposal to Change 6x1 Work Schedule Gains Momentum in Brazil**\nA proposal to change the 6x1 work schedule (six days of work and one day of rest per week) has gained momentum in Brazil. The proposal, presented by Erika Hilton (PSOL-SP) on May 1st, aims to end the 6x1 schedule and adopt a 36-hour workweek, divided into four days. The proposal has the support of over 130 parliamentarians, but still needs 171 signatures from the 513 members of the House to move forward. The proposal would alter Article 7 of the Constitution, which currently limits the workweek to 44 hours. The change would allow for shorter workweeks and more days off, as seen in other countries. However, the proposal faces resistance from some sectors. According to Marcos Vinícius Nascimento, a lawyer, the proposal could increase employability but also burden employers with more formal employment costs. 'It increases employability, but may burden the employer, who will have more charges with formal employment,' he said. The list of parliamentarians who have signed the proposal includes members from various parties, such as PSOL, PT, PCdoB, PDT, PSB, PV, and UNIÃO.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 09:10 AM\nSource:[noticiasaominuto.com.br](https://www.noticiasaominuto.com.br/economia/2225380/3-veja-lista-de-deputados-que-assinaram-a-favor-da-mudanca-na-escala-6-x-1)\n\n**Bolsonaro Family Rejects End of 6x1 Work Schedule, but Supports Eternal Rest for Themselves**\nThe Bolsonaro family and the PL (Liberal Party) bloc have rejected the end of the 6x1 work schedule, calling it a 'threat' to Brazilian tradition. They argue that the 6-day workweek and 1-day rest schedule is what keeps the country on track. However, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who refuses to support the proposed amendment by Erika Hilton, seems to support a lighter work schedule for himself and his family, the 0x365, a lifestyle with eternal rest - except for the 'hard work' of destroying the country, according to his critics.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 05:36 AM\nSource:[O Globo](https://oglobo.globo.com/blogs/humor/sensacionalista/post/2024/11/familia-bolsonaro-rejeita-fim-da-jornada-6-x-1-mas-defende-jornada-0-x-365-para-si.ghtml)\n\n**Brazilian Politicians Unite to End 6x1 Work Schedule**\nA proposal to end the 6x1 work schedule in Brazil has gained 134 signatures, led by federal deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL).

This would effectively end the 6x1 schedule.

The movement has gained traction, with 134 lawmakers signing a proposal to amend the Constitution and establish a maximum 36-hour workweek and 4-day workweek in Brazil. The proposal, led by Deputy Erika Hilton, aims to end the 6x1 schedule, which she argues is a form of 'prison' that takes away workers' right to spend time with their families, care for themselves, and pursue other opportunities. The proposal has received support from labor unions, but has also faced criticism from business groups and some lawmakers, who argue that it would increase costs and harm the economy. The proposal needs 171 signatures to move forward in the Chamber of Deputies and 308 votes to pass in two rounds of voting. 'This is a matter of dignity for workers,' said Erika Hilton. 'The 6x1 schedule is a form of exploitation that affects the quality of life of employees, compromising their health, well-being, and family relationships,' added the petition online. 'It's time for the country to adopt a 4x3 or 5x2 model, without reducing salaries,' said Deputy Reginaldo Lopes. 'The 6x1 schedule is a prison, and it's incompatible with the dignity of workers,' argued Erika Hilton. 'The reduction of the workday to 40 hours is possible and healthy when it results from collective decision-making,' said Minister Luiz Marinho.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[estadaomatogrosso.com.br](https://www.estadaomatogrosso.com.br/brasil/pec-6x1-cresce-a-pressao-pela-aprovacao-da-proposta/102927)\n\n**Proposal to End 6x1 Schedule Sparks Debate**\nA proposal by federal deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL-SP) to end the 6x1 schedule, which allows for six days of work and one day of rest per week, has sparked controversy on social media. The intention is to replace the current 44-hour weekly schedule with 36 hours, resulting in four days of nine hours or five days of 7.2 hours. According to Hilton, the reason for the difference in productivity between Brazilians and Americans is not due to the Brazilians being better, but rather the quality of education. 'It is because they are better? No, it is because of the quality of education,' Hilton said.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 02:11 PM\nSource:[GZH](https://gauchazh.clicrbs.com.br/colunistas/marta-sfredo/noticia/2024/11/e-dificil-resistir-a-tentacao-do-fim-da-escala-6x1-mas-a-proposta-e-factivel-cm3d349t5001g015tm4brwopc.html)\n\n**Brazilian Proposal Aims to End 6x1 Work Schedule and Improve Workers' Quality of Life**\nA proposal to end the 6x1 work schedule, which requires workers to work six days a week and have one day off, has gained momentum in Brazil. The proposal, led by the VAT (Vida Além do Trabalho) movement, aims to reduce the workweek to four days and three days off, without affecting salaries or benefits. The proposal, presented by federal deputy Érika Hilton (PSOL-SP), has already been signed by 71 of 513 deputies, and needs the support of 171 deputies and 27 senators to be presented to Congress. According to the proposal, the change aims to provide Brazilian workers with more time off and improve their quality of life, without compromising salaries and benefits. The VAT movement has mobilized public support through a petition, which has already gathered over 1.3 million signatures. 'It is well known that the workweek in Brazil often exceeds reasonable limits, with the 6x1 work schedule being one of the main causes of physical and mental exhaustion of workers. The abusive work hours imposed by this work schedule negatively affect the quality of life of employees, compromising their health, well-being, and family relationships,' said the petition. The 6x1 work schedule is widely used in sectors that operate every day, such as commerce, supermarkets, and pharmacies. The proposal aims to align the workweek in Brazil with more modern models adopted in other countries, where the weekly rest period is longer.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 10, 2024 03:19 PM\nSource:[Campo Grande News](https://www.campograndenews.com.br/politica/da-bancada-de-ms-dagoberto-e-camila-assinaram-pec-que-propoe-fim-da-escala-6x1)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."
