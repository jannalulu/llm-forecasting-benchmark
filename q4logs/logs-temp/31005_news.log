**Fed Cuts Interest Rates for Third Time Since March 2020**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has decided to lower interest rates by 25 basis points for the third time since March 2020, setting them at a target range of 4.25% to 4.50%. This reduction follows previous cuts in September and November. The Fed stated that the risks for employment and inflation are 'more or less balanced' and remains 'attentive' to potential threats from both sides. According to the Fed, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to grow at a solid pace, but the labor market has lost momentum since the beginning of the year, with the unemployment rate rising, although remaining low. The inflation rate has continued to move towards the Fed's 2% target, but remains elevated. The Fed will be attentive to incoming data and will be prepared to adjust interest rates as necessary, analyzing labor market, inflation, and international and financial event effects. As in September, one member of the Fed, Beth Hammack, voted against the interest rate cut, preferring to keep them at 4.50%-4.75%. The Fed will continue to reduce its balance sheet by re-investing principal payments from Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The US economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the third quarter of 2024, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.2% in November, and the consumer price index (CPI) increasing to 2.3% in October.

**International markets face an uncertain 2025. Here's what to look out for**
International markets are facing an uncertain 2025, with concerns of slow growth, higher inflation risks, and a stronger dollar from U.S. tariffs weighing on investors. 'Many global multi-asset investors are approaching 2025 with some trepidation, and the growing unease is understandable,' said Todd Jablonski, chief investment officer at Principal Asset Management. The list of significant concerns is long, including a strong U.S. dollar, which could hurt international markets by hurting other countries' purchasing power. 'A strong U.S. dollar, fueled by protectionist trade policies, is making imports from the U.S. more expensive and reducing returns for U.S. investors with non-U.S. holdings,' said Richard Ratner, senior vice president at Bel Air Investment Advisors. Weak growth worldwide is also a concern, with Europe and China forecast to underperform in 2025. However, not all hope is lost, with some pockets of opportunity emerging, such as Japan and India. 'This could actually boost E.U. competitiveness,' said Ryan Dykmans, chief investment officer at Dunham & Associates Investment Counsel. 'As the economy enters its third year of normalization, we expect Japanese stocks to enter a sustained growth phase, driven by corporate governance reforms that lead to a different pace of corporate behavior,' said JPMorgan strategist Rie Nishihara. India is also expected to be one of the top emerging markets next year, with strong earnings, macro stability, and domestic flows. However, not all of Wall Street is as bullish, with Bank of America saying it's stuck 'between hope and caution' on Indian equities next year.

**Trump's Presidency: A Key Investment Focus in 2025**
As the US presidential election approaches, market sentiment has become increasingly optimistic about the US stock market. Analysts believe that President Trump's personnel appointments and policy implementations will be the key investment focus in the first quarter of 2025. Given the global economic data divergence, it is recommended to invest in a balanced fund to grasp the financial market's investment rhythm. According to S&P Global, the US service industry expanded at its fastest pace in over three years in December, while manufacturing remained sluggish. This indicates that the US economy is becoming increasingly polarized, with manufacturing stagnating and services performing well, which is expected to continue supporting the US economy's stable growth. Meanwhile, the Eurozone's PMI continued to decline in December, and the Eurozone economy remains in a recession, relying on services to recover, while manufacturing remains sluggish. The European Central Bank has also lowered its economic growth rate and inflation forecast. The global economy is experiencing different trends. The Daiwa Securities target return combination fund research team predicts that with the uncertainty of the 2025 US presidential election eliminated and inflation expected to decrease gradually, the BofA Investment Clock shows that the economy is in the 'recovery' stage in 2024, with low interest rates and high earnings-per-share stocks expected to rise. In 2025, the economy will enter the 'prosperity' stage, where earnings-per-share is high and interest rates are high. At the same time, the 2025 bond yield curve will turn bearish, indicating a shift from a deflationary to an inflationary environment, where bond prices will decline and interest rates will decrease. Equity performance will outperform bonds, but this will be a positive factor for most risk assets, so it is still worth paying attention to stock performance.

**Saudi Investors Flock to US Stock Market, with $24 Billion Invested in Q3 2024**
Saudi investors have shown a significant increase in their investments in the US stock market, with a total value of around $24 billion in the third quarter of 2024, representing a growth of 110.5% compared to the same period in 2023. The US stock market accounted for 98.66% of the total foreign transactions of Saudi investors, which reached $24.23 billion. The Saudi investors' transactions in the US stock market increased by 30.6% compared to the same period in 2023, reaching $56.14 billion. According to Sa'id Khalil al-'Abasi, a writer and economic analyst, the US stock market has several advantages, including the availability of various investment options, such as mutual funds, futures contracts, and stocks listed on the exchange. He also notes that the US stock market has high liquidity, transparency, and credibility, making it an attractive destination for Saudi investors. The analyst expects the US stock market to continue its growth in 2024 and 2025, with the S&P 500 index expected to reach 6084 dollars by December 2024 and 6544 dollars by December 2025.

**Foreign Direct Investment Decreases by 26.6% in Q3 2024**
According to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, foreign direct investment (FDI) in the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 26.6% compared to the same period last year, with a total investment of $14.19 billion. The FDI in the Americas region decreased by 34.4% to $5.13 billion, while the FDI in Europe, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean decreased by 36%, 29.2%, and 21.3% respectively. The Ministry explained that the decrease in FDI is due to 'global economic uncertainty, high interest rates, and geopolitical risks.' A government official stated, 'Many companies that invested in the US semiconductor industry through IRA support have reduced their investment.' The top industries for FDI were finance and insurance ($6.06 billion), manufacturing ($3.97 billion), mining ($1.29 billion), and information and communication ($853 million). The information and communication industry saw a significant increase in investment, with a 3-fold increase from the same period last year, attributed to the efforts of game companies such as NCSoft and Krafton to strengthen their global competitiveness.

**Mexico's Economy: A Look Ahead to 2025**
Mexico's economy grew 1.1% in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, according to the INEGI. This suggests that economic activity in Mexico accelerated in the third quarter compared to the first half of the year. However, there were several unusual events in the first half of the year that created favorable base effects. The labor market is showing signs of weakness, with formal employment growth slowing significantly. The PIB registered a growth rate of 1.6% in the third quarter of 2024, and a cumulative growth of 1.8%, above the consensus of analyst surveys. The balance of risks for Mexico's growth in 2025 is skewed to the upside, due to a better manufacturing outlook in the US and the lack of coordination in public spending between the outgoing and incoming administrations. Additionally, the 'nearshoring' trend is continuing, but in a less visible way, as foreign companies are investing in existing infrastructure and hiring local engineers to manage their operations. 'Nearshoring' will be a key driver of growth in 2025, according to the author. 'The 'nearshoring' is happening, but it's not being seen in the usual indicators,' said the author. 'The model of productive investment in Mexico has changed. Foreign companies no longer want to come to the country to build a factory from scratch. They want to come to a safe place that offers the infrastructure they need, water and electricity mainly, where they can simply arrive, connect their machines and hire some engineers to manage their operation. That's what the industrial parks in Mexico offer and that's not counted as FDI because they are being built by local developers of industrial parks.'

**U.S. Gold Corp Reaches 52-Week High of $8.57 Amid Sector-Wide Bullish Sentiment**
U.S. Gold Corp (USAU) has reached a 52-week high of $8.57, a significant increase of 136.87% in the last year. This surge in price reflects a growing appetite for perceived safe-haven assets and positions USAU as a standout performer in the sector. The company has also made significant progress on its CK Gold Project, obtaining the necessary permit for development and conducting advanced engineering and optimization studies to support the transition to the development phase. These studies have focused on areas such as the tailings management facility (TMF), water management, and plant operations. The Tierra Group International of Denver has examined the TMF design to potentially increase its capacity and reduce capital costs without altering the approved footprint. USAU is also refining its water management strategy to strengthen its water collection capabilities, with the goal of reducing its reliance on purchased water. Additionally, the company is exploring alternative flotation technologies that could improve metal recovery rates and reduce operating costs. These recent developments are part of USAU's broader effort to consolidate the economic feasibility of the project before releasing the updated Prefeasibility Study in the third quarter of 2024. InvestingPro data reveals an impressive total price return of 126.33% in the last year, aligning with the 136.87% increase reported in the article, confirming the exceptional performance of the title. The current price of the company stands at an impressive 93.29% of its 52-week high, indicating sustained momentum. InvestingPro's suggestions highlight that USAU has shown strong returns not only on an annual basis but also in the last month and the last three months, with gains of 27.29% and 36.36%, respectively. This short-term strength suggests continued investor confidence in the company's prospects.

**Mexico's Balance of Payments: A Mixed Picture of Economic Stability and Uncertainty**
Mexico's balance of payments for the third quarter of the year has been released, showing a certain stability and some additional signs of economic deceleration and uncertainty. The current account, which records transactions of goods, services, and transfers, showed a slight surplus in the third quarter, similar to the second quarter. Remittances were the driving force behind this surplus. The balance of payments is also the primary source of information for analyzing foreign direct investment. In the third quarter, foreign direct investment net (entries minus exits) was $1,443 million. For the first nine months of the year, the total foreign direct investment was $31,330 million, a 3.3% increase from the same period in 2023. The total entries of resources directed to investment were $35,738 million, slightly higher than the $35,226 million that entered in the same months of last year. Foreign direct investment typically represents around 10% of Mexico's total investment, but it is a fundamental lever for growth, not only because of the resources involved, but also because of the externalities associated with it, such as the transfer of technology, changes in productivity, and the exchange of knowledge. The entry of new investment, considered different from the reinvestment of profits or accounts between companies, was $511 million in the third quarter, lower than the $684 million in the second quarter and the $865 million in the first quarter. According to the data presented yesterday, new investments represent only 6% of the entries, down from 50% in 2022 and 14% in 2023. Foreign direct investment is not a clear sign of the relocalization phenomenon, and it could be a lagging variable. However, there is no evidence of a change in the trend of investments, despite announcements of investment and narratives of historical highs. In the international context, Mexico still presents opportunities, but the reinvestment of profits accounts for 86% of the investments. Investors are waiting to see if the country will provide the necessary conditions for new resource injections. Meanwhile, while Mexico falters in providing what is needed to promote investment, Trump prepares his return to the White House and will not hesitate to seek alternative destinations for those investments.

**Mexico's Foreign Direct Investment Sees Mixed Results in Third Quarter of 2024**
According to Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico captured $2.1 billion in new investments in the third quarter of 2024, exceeding the $900 million of the previous period. Luis Rosendo Gutiérrez, subsecretary of Foreign Trade, stated that the Direct Foreign Investment (IED) reached a new historical record in the third quarter of 2024, totaling $5.737 billion, a 9% growth compared to 2023. The Secretary of Economy estimated that the IED will reach $38.172 billion by the end of 2024. However, Gabriela Siller Pagaza, director of Economic Analysis at Grupo Financiero BASE, expressed concerns about the investment figures, stating that 'the numbers are very negative' and that 'there was no reinvestment of profits and new investment decreased again.' She also noted that most of the investment was due to inter-company accounts, which are often just a bookkeeping entry. The economy captured $3.217 billion in IED between July and September, a 4.2% increase compared to the same period in 2023, according to the balance of payments data from the Bank of Mexico.

**Thai economic and investment landscape under Trump 2.0**
The global economy in 2025 will be shaped by three themes: US economic resilience, China's strategic pivot, and escalating economic tensions following Donald Trump's return to the White House. Despite US economic strength, the Federal Reserve expects four interest rate cuts in 2025, potentially bringing the federal funds rate down to 3.4% by year-end. The International Monetary Fund projects increased trade barriers under the Trump administration could slow global economic growth by 0.1 to 0.8 percentage points in 2025. In Thailand, the economy exhibited resilience in the third quarter, with GDP growth reaching 3.0% year-on-year, driven by public investment and robust growth of 25.9%. However, net exports showed mixed signals, growing at a rate of 10.5%, up from 4.7% in the previous quarter. Looking ahead, we are concerned that Thailand's economy will face major challenges from global economic headwinds and trade tensions. Nevertheless, we expect two more interest rate cuts by the Bank of Thailand and an increase in government budget disbursement, which may lead to a domestic consumption recovery. Investors are advised to prioritise domestic consumption plays and defensive growth sectors such as telecom, tourism, healthcare and retail.

**US clean energy investments hit record-high in Q3: Rhodium**
According to a report from Rhodium Group, a record $71 billion was invested in U.S. clean energy and transportation in the third quarter of 2024, representing a 12% increase year-over-year and a 2% increase from Q2 of 2024. Clean energy investing accounted for 5% of total U.S. private investment in structures, equipment, and durable goods, up from 4.5% in Q3 of 2023. However, despite the growth, the nation is still off track to reach its 2030 emissions reduction targets. Rhodium said that the current pipeline of clean electricity projects does not translate to enough new capacity in 2025 to keep pace with decarbonization expectations. The report also found that the pipeline of new clean energy and transportation manufacturing investments slowed in the third quarter, with a 9% decrease from 2024's Q2 and a 62% decline from Q3 of 2023. Rhodium's analysts said that policy interventions have the potential to address the permitting-related obstacles and enhance the likelihood that the IRA can fully deliver on its clean electricity deployment potential.

**Mexico Sees 133% Increase in New Foreign Investments in Q3 2024**
Mexico's new foreign investments showed a positive trend in the third quarter of 2024, with a 133% increase compared to the second quarter, according to the Secretary of Economy, Marcelo Ebrard. The country captured $2.1 billion in new investments, surpassing the $900 million of the previous period. Luis Rosendo Gutiérrez, subsecretary of Foreign Trade, stated that the total foreign direct investment (FDI) in the third quarter was $5.737 billion, a new historical record. 'It's the highest FDI figure our country has had. Even if we compare it to the third quarter of last year, we grew 9%. This indicates that we accelerated in the last quarter,' he said. However, experts like Miguel González Ibarra and Rodolfo Ramos pointed out that there are still areas of opportunity that Mexico needs to address, such as implementing policies friendly to the private sector and addressing concerns about institutional deterioration and potential policies of Trump. 'The idea of allowing public-private associations and unblocking investments in energy will be a success,' said González Ibarra. 'The nearshoring is working, something is happening economically,' added Ebrard, referring to the fact that Mexico is attracting investments due to its proximity to the US market.

**Austrian Real Estate Market Shows Signs of Life**
The Austrian real estate investment market is showing signs of life in the third quarter of 2024, with a volume of around 1.1 billion euros, about 11% higher than the same period last year. This is according to the current Arnold Immobilien market analysis. Markus Arnold, CEO of Arnold Immobilien, notes that 'private investors are still showing great interest in the high-quality existing products currently on offer. Additional dynamism comes from international early movers.' He also emphasizes that 'a growing deal pipeline and the already confirmed transactions in the fourth quarter indicate a sustainable revival of the domestic investment market.' The focus of investment transactions in 2024 is on office buildings, accounting for around 50% of the volume. In the third quarter of 2024, the residential segment (deal volume from 15 million euros) also showed a significant increase in dynamics. Austrian residential real estate is becoming increasingly attractive to international investors due to the currently very attractive sales prices. 'The majority of completed deals in the residential segment were made with foreign capital, with most cases being purchased with the support of local investment management companies,' reports Martin Ofner, head of market analysis at Arnold Immobilien. Improved framework conditions are expected to influence the investment market in 2025, with macroeconomic experts predicting that the future economic development and interest rate development will be the dominant factors. In terms of Austrian economic growth in 2025, it will be observed whether the autumn forecasts of Austrian economic research institutes, with +0.8% (IHS) and +1.0% (WIFO) GDP growth, are accurate. For investors, an end to the Austrian economic recession would be a much-needed signal to increase confidence in demand on the user markets.

**Uncertainty Favors Gold: A Look at the Global Debt Situation and Gold Investments**
The uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election is over, but long-term gold price predictions are still challenging. Factors such as interest rate development, monetary policy of the American central bank, and inflation expectations are crucial. Unpredictable events like the pandemic can occur. However, it is certain that more and more countries want to reduce their dependence on the US dollar. Estimates suggest that the yuan will rise and the US dollar will decline. The global debt is immense, with the International Monetary Fund estimating that it will exceed $100 trillion for the first time. The US and China are the largest debtors, followed by Italy, France, Brazil, and the UK. The increasing debt is driven by factors such as climate change and aging populations. This debt situation speaks in favor of gold. As a result, interest in gold investments in Europe is high. In October, the number of investors who invested in gold for the first time worldwide doubled compared to the previous year. The same applies to the third quarter as a whole. In the third quarter of 2024, it was particularly the ETF inflows that drove up gold demand. Even the lower demand for bars, coins, and jewelry could not change this. With interest rate cuts and high government debt, further inflows into ETFs are expected. Gold remains the preferred means of preserving values, protecting wealth, and not watching wealth decline due to the devaluation of currencies. The values of gold mining companies are also a possibility. Miata Metals has earn-in options for the acquisition of a stake (100%) in the Gold Project Sela Creek in Suriname and also in the Cabin Lake property in British Columbia. Fury Gold Mines is active in Nunavut and Quebec. At the Eau-Claire project, more than 12 grams of gold per ton of rock have already been detected. Fury Gold Mines holds a significant stake in Dolly Varden Silver.

**A Resilient Global Market in 2024**
The global market has shown resilience in 2024, providing extraordinary returns in investment portfolios, particularly in relation to global markets, especially in the United States. This has occurred despite the presence of various economic, geopolitical, and political factors that have introduced volatility. The US economy has shown signs of strength and stands out in the global context, despite the uncertainties and expectation of deceleration generated by a restrictive monetary policy after the interest rate hike cycle by the Federal Reserve. According to the IMF projections, the growth for 2024 is expected to be 2.6%, compared to 2.5% in 2023, which represents a growth higher than the developed world average, estimated at 1.7% for this year. Although the labor market has begun to show signs of weakness, data such as the unemployment rate and consumption figures that exceed analysts' expectations are observed. In terms of inflation, a downward trend is appreciated, with some fluctuations throughout the year, but in general, a greater certainty of relaxation in monetary policy is projected. The main stock market indices reported positive returns in double digits at the end of the third quarter, based on various regional factors. In the United States, a less marked divergence in sectoral returns has been seen, with a significant boost in companies benefiting from the advancement of artificial intelligence, as well as in other sectors with attractive growth and undervalued valuations. The expectation for the third quarter is a growth of over 7%, compared to 11.2% in the previous quarter, which is a notable figure. Globally, positive stories are also found, such as Japan's economic strength and its exit from a low-inflation environment, supported by optimistic expectations regarding changes in regulation and corporate governance that benefit the country's companies. In Europe, the situation is more complicated, with a technical recession in Germany and lower growth in corporate profits, with projections of a decline for 2024; however, expectations for 2025 may improve, both in terms of economic growth and profits, given a lower comparative base and a recovery with the relaxation of monetary policy, where it seems that the ECB has more room for cuts. In emerging markets, China's situation is notable. Since the pandemic, the country has faced weaknesses that have affected its growth potential, as well as the lack of government measures to significantly boost consumer confidence and the real estate sector. Recently, signs of greater government intervention have been seen to achieve the 5% growth target, actions that the market has received positively, which has improved the stock market performance and positioned China among the countries with the best performance of the year. In summary, the strength of the stock market in 2024 is based on solid economic growth, business innovation, and a robust labor market. However, factors such as geopolitical risk and electoral uncertainty present challenges that investors must consider. On the one hand, geopolitical instability, particularly in the Middle East, has created an environment of uncertainty that investors observe with attention. As tensions increase, global markets experience volatility, which affects especially energy and raw materials sectors. The price of oil has shown significant fluctuations and any escalation in the conflict can impact production costs, supply chains, and inflation, being a determining factor for monetary policy. Another crucial factor is the electoral cycle in the United States. With the uncertainty of the final results of the presidential elections in sight, political uncertainty can cause market movements. The promises of the candidates on issues such as the economy, fiscal policy, and financial regulation will influence investor confidence.

**Poll position: US election could rattle global markets, says ASPS**
Asia Plus Securities (ASPS) is warning investors to be cautious ahead of the US election, predicting it will lead to increased market volatility. ASPS suggests focusing on stocks with low volatility and strong third-quarter performances for 2024. The brokerage also notes that the Thai economy is expected to see a boost from the government's fiscal 2024 and 2025 budgets, which include increased spending and private investment. However, high debt levels and potential credit rating downgrades are concerns. ASPS analysts predict a shortfall in listed companies' earnings for the third quarter, but forecast the SET index to tick upwards due to a low earnings yield gap. The brokerage recommends keeping an eye on stable performers such as WHA Corporation, Plan B Media, and Bangkok Dusit Medical Services. 'It's time to back stocks boasting low volatility and stellar third-quarter performances for 2024,' said ASPS. 'With interest rate cuts potentially taking a rain check and global central banks keeping markets on tenterhooks, bond yields might just shoot up, fuelled further by escalating international tensions,' the brokerage added.

**Investments hinge on US election result**
Investors are advised to monitor the US election results on November 5, as it may impact global investments and create volatility in stock markets, according to Asia Plus Securities (ASPS). ASPS recommends focusing on stocks with low volatility and those expected to report healthy performances for the third quarter of 2024. The brokerage also notes that the US Federal Reserve's indication of a slower pace of interest rate cuts and rising geopolitical risks may influence investment decisions. ASPS outlines a cautious investment strategy for November, recommending investors steer clear of volatile stocks that may be affected by the US election. The brokerage also forecasts the profits of listed companies for the third quarter to be below expectations, with an earnings yield gap (EYG) of 3.8% consistent with the historical average. ASPS projects the earnings per share for the SET index to be 91.4 baht in 2024, rising slightly to 98.8 baht in 2025. The SET index target is 1,510 points for 2024 and 1,633 points for 2025, assuming the policy rate remains at 2.25% and the EYG at 3.8%. ASPS recommends stocks such as WHA Corporation (WHA), Plan B Media (PLANB), CP Axtra (CPAXT), Bangkok Dusit Medical Services (BDMS), SC Asset Corporation (SC) and Airports of Thailand (AOT) for their potential to post net profit growth in the third quarter while maintaining low volatility.

**Global Foreign Direct Investment Sees Significant Increase in First Half of 2024**
The global foreign direct investment (FDI) increased to $802 billion in the first half of 2024, according to the OECD. The majority of the growth occurred in the first quarter, with a significant increase in advanced economies, as stated in an OECD report. However, in the second quarter, FDI fell 36% compared to the first quarter, reflecting the persistent volatility in global markets. The OECD countries saw an 80% increase in FDI to $338 billion, although the growth would be 14% if the entries in Luxembourg and the Netherlands are not included. Mexico ranked third in FDI capture. The US was the largest recipient of FDI globally between January and June, followed by Brazil and Mexico. In contrast, FDI fell 19% in non-OCDE G20 countries, mainly due to the impact of China, where the trend of decline continued due to geopolitical and economic uncertainties affecting foreign investors' confidence. Emerging and developing economies saw significant setbacks, and in the second quarter, they reached their lowest level in two years. Despite uncertain prospects in the second half of 2024, the report notes that the technology and renewable energy sectors have captured a significant portion of investments in advanced economies, led by the US and Australia.

**US Investors Are Bracing For Big, Big Things**
This week is crucial for US investors as five of the 'Magnificent Seven' companies, including Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Apple, are set to report their earnings. Analysts predict that these companies saw their earnings grow by 18% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. The US economy is also expected to show strong growth, with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow model projecting a 3.4% annualized rate in the third quarter. However, this could lead to mixed feelings among investors, as strong growth may boost corporate earnings but also force the Federal Reserve to slow its pace of interest rate cuts, potentially weighing on the stock market's high valuations. The International Monetary Fund has also lowered its global growth forecast for 2025, citing rising geopolitical risks. Meanwhile, gold prices have hit a record high, driven by falling interest rates, central banks' demand for the metal, and heightened economic and geopolitical risks.

**IMF Brightens US Economic Growth Projections, Warns National Debt 'Not Stabilized'**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its US economic growth forecast upward to 2.8% in 2024, citing strong consumer spending and robust business investment. However, the IMF also warned that the US public debt is not stabilized, with the fiscal deficit projected at 7.6% of GDP in 2024 and 6% by 2029. The IMF also expects inflation to average 3% in 2024 and decline to 1.9% by 2025. The Federal Reserve's rate-cutting cycle is expected to continue, with the federal funds rate projected to return to its long-term equilibrium of 2.9% by the third quarter of 2026. The IMF emphasized that 'delaying is costly' and that the US public debt is at risk of increasing further if action is not taken to address the fiscal deficit.

**ClearBridge International Growth ACWI Ex-US Strategy Q3 2024 Commentary**
The ClearBridge International Growth ACWI Ex-US Strategy underperformed its MSCI ACWI Ex-U.S. benchmark in the third quarter, but delivered gains across all nine sectors in which it was invested. The Strategy's performance was driven by stock selection in the consumer discretionary, financials, and consumer staples sectors, but was offset by negative sector allocation effects. The largest contributors to absolute returns included Inditex, Haleon, argenx, HOYA, and London Stock Exchange, while the greatest detractors were Novo Nordisk, ASML, Tokyo Electron, and Rentokil. The Strategy added new positions in Prysmian, Coupang, and repurchased Spotify, and exited positions in Antofagasta, Givaudan, Monday.com, Hexagon, Daifuku, and McDonald's Japan. The team remains confident in the Japan market, citing a continued recovery in domestic demand, rising GDP growth, and a low risk of deflation returning. The team also believes that China's aggressive stimulus measures announced late in the quarter will support global economic activity through the end of the year and into 2025.
