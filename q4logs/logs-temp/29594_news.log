**Who Will Hit $1 First: BlockDAG The Hybrid Blockchain Giant Or Tron the Crypto Powerhouse?**
BlockDAG is racing towards a $1 target by 2025, putting it ahead of Tron, which has only reached $0.30 so far. BlockDAG has made an explosive entry into the crypto world, hitting milestone after milestone from the start, and has rewarded its early users with a striking ROI after just 7 months. In comparison, Tron has never gone over $0.30, despite its size and market time. BlockDAG's steady achievement of goals and swift presale phases outshine many veteran cryptos, and its ability to forge and sustain ties with the broader crypto community is what participants find most captivating. 'If this pace continues, BlockDAG might not just reach $1 -- it could soar beyond it,' said a source. BlockDAG's low entry costs, successful testnet, and new methods to enrich its community's experience have drawn in crypto fans and traders eager for big wins.

**Will Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) Explode as Bitcoin Reaches $90,000?**
As Bitcoin is expected to reach $90,000, analysts predict that altcoins like Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) will also experience an upward trend. The influence of Bitcoin has almost always had an effect on the prices of altcoins, as increased liquidity and interest cause their value to rise. Many investors are looking at these promising altcoins, particularly ADA and XRP, as they are expected to benefit from the potential bull run. Cardano (ADA) has recently gained attention as it seems that fundamental and technical indicators are pointing to a rise. Currently, ADA is trading at a lower price than its all-time high of $3.09. Analysts believe that even if Cardano does not follow Bitcoin, there is strong support for Cardano at $0.2803, from which further growth can occur. Cardano's RSI is at 45.2, indicating a light bearish sentiment, but the overall trend for the coin is bullish. Investors are curious to see if ADA can break through its resistance at $0.4057; if it succeeds, it could lead to a price increase to $0.4662. Ripple (XRP) is also ready to be a leading altcoin and will increase in value as Bitcoin rises. The gradual growth of XRP in the current price range of $0.5643 - $0.5904 shows some bullish momentum, as the RSI is at 57.26. If the Bitcoin rally occurs, Ripple could reach important resistance levels of $0.6651 and $0.7639. Analysts are optimistic about the growth potential of XRP and believe it could reach $2.20 as market demand increases. This recent positive momentum for Ripple is supported by broader optimistic expectations from investors who consider Ripple a strategic, long-term investment. If XRP falls below the support level of $0.4498, short-term corrections may be possible, but the overall sentiment remains bullish. The usability of XRP in cross-border payments and its strong market position make it one of the most significant coins in the token category. While Bitcoin approaches a bull market, investors seeking long-term gains can invest in Ripple. Rexas is the only altcoin that has emerged from unknown territory, with real applications in a market dominated by speculation in digital assets. RXS enables investors to create liquidity in traditionally illiquid real assets by effectively tokenizing real estate and commodities. This innovative approach has stimulated demand, with over 102 million tokens sold and $5 million raised so far. Fractional ownership via RXS allows investors to own valuable assets, making investment portfolios more flexible. With the current token price of $0.070, the next funding phase should increase the price, attracting even more interest. Investors seeking stability and diversification outside conventional cryptocurrencies value the very safe and verified platform of Rexas Finance.

**Robinhood, Kraken, Galaxy Digital launch USDG: A new era of global stablecoin dominance | Stock Market News**
A consortium of companies including Robinhood, Kraken, and Galaxy Digital has launched a new stablecoin network called the Global Dollar Network, which aims to accelerate the use of stablecoins worldwide. The new stablecoin, USDG, is pegged to the U.S. dollar and is designed to provide economic benefits to its partners. However, USDG will face stiff competition in a market dominated by Tether and USD Coin, which account for nearly 90% of the total market capitalization. The move comes as crypto players anticipate U.S. officials warming up to digital assets, regardless of the outcome of the presidential election.

**Robinhood Launches US Presidential Election Prediction Market—For Americans Only**
Robinhood has launched a US presidential election prediction market, allowing traders to speculate on whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris will win the election. The move comes as the election approaches its final stages. Unlike other platforms, Robinhood's offering is purely US-focused and is offered through ForecastEx, a futures commission merchant regulated under the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The platform has restrictions in place, prohibiting US presidential election or politics-related individuals from participating, and each bettor must be approved by Robinhood Derivatives. The market will resolve two months after the election, on January 7, 2025, after results are certified by Congress.

**Robinhood Launches Prediction Market for 2024 US Presidential Election**
Robinhood has launched a prediction market for the 2024 US presidential election, allowing users to bet on Donald Trump or Kamala Harris as the winners. The platform, Robinhood Derivatives (RHD), allows US citizens with an active trading account, approved for margin trading or options, to participate. Each user can buy up to 5,000 contracts for a candidate, with prices reflecting the probability of victory: $0.62 for Trump and $0.38 for Harris. The winning contract will pay $1, while the losing one will have no value. Payments are expected on January 8, 2025, after the Congressional certification on January 6. This launch joins platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi, which already offer prediction contracts on political events. The prediction market is growing, with Polymarket having already seen volumes of over $2.5 billion in election bets, highlighting investor interest. The market has grown 500% in the last year, thanks to technologies like blockchain, which increase liquidity and security.

**Robinhood offers bitcoin and ether futures, rolling out new trading tools**
Robinhood has announced plans to expand its crypto offerings by introducing bitcoin and ether futures, along with advanced derivatives trading tools. The platform will support futures trading on Bitcoin, Ether, and other assets like the S&P 500 and oil. Robinhood is also launching its new 'Robinhood Legend' desktop app, targeting active traders with customizable tools and index options. Additionally, the company is considering launching its own stablecoin, which could challenge Tether's dominance in the $170 billion digital asset market. However, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has voiced concerns about the risks posed by EU rules, which could force exchanges to delist non-compliant tokens like USDT. Robinhood has also agreed to pay a $3.9 million penalty to settle an investigation by California's Department of Justice, which found that the company misled customers about securing competitive prices and forced them to sell their cryptocurrency back to the platform to exit.

**Robinhood confirms plan to support bitcoin, ether futures trading amid desktop rollout**
Robinhood has confirmed plans to support bitcoin and ether futures trading, as part of a broader rollout of derivatives products and a new desktop platform. The firm stated, 'You asked and we delivered. We’re launching futures trading directly in the Robinhood app, letting customers trade the S&P 500, oil, bitcoin and more.' The bitcoin and ether futures products will begin rolling out to customers in the coming months, with support for Bitcoin Futures, Micro Bitcoin Futures, Bitcoin Friday Futures, Ether Futures and Micro Ether Futures via the CME. Despite receiving a Wells notice from the SEC in early May, Robinhood seems set on expanding its crypto enterprise, with plans to launch a stablecoin and a new desktop trading application, 'Robinhood Legend', designed for active traders. 'With Robinhood Legend, futures and index options, we’re helping customers harness the full power of the markets so they can take control of their financial future,' said Robinhood Chairman and CEO Vlad Tenev.

**Fintech giants enter stablecoin race as demand for digital assets grows**
Fintech giants Revolut and Robinhood are exploring entry into the stablecoin sector, driven by growing demand for digital assets. Revolut plans to launch its own stablecoin to expand its digital offerings and solidify its position in fintech innovation. Robinhood is evaluating the potential to offer stablecoin services to attract more users and diversify its digital asset product suite. This move could lead to increased competition and innovation in the stablecoin market, pushing it closer to widespread adoption. However, success will depend on regulatory approvals and addressing concerns around security, transparency, and compliance.

**Robinhood is seeing ‘a lot of engagement’ from retail users**
Robinhood's Johann Kerbrat stated that the company is seeing 'a lot of engagement' from retail users, particularly in the EU where it is expanding its offerings and awaiting its MiCA license. Once licensed, Robinhood plans to scale its services across the EU. In contrast, the US market is more challenging due to the lack of a crypto license and the SEC's Wells Notice. Kerbrat expressed disappointment with the Wells Notice, stating that the company has focused on establishing a safe business and has not listed a ton of assets or offered staking in the US. Despite the uncertainty, Kerbrat noted that nothing has changed for Robinhood's US business, and the company is focused on ensuring its existing features work for customers. Robinhood's customer base is a good gauge of retail engagement, with Kerbrat stating that the company still sees 'a lot of engagement off-chain and on-chain.' He also clarified that Robinhood is not preparing to launch stablecoins at this time.

**Robinhood Launches Cryptocurrency Transfers in Europe**
Robinhood has launched cryptocurrency transfers for European clients. The platform now allows users to deposit and withdraw over 20 digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and USD Coin (USDC). Additionally, Robinhood Crypto will provide European clients with a 1% bonus on all cryptocurrency deposits for a limited time. According to Johan Kerbrat, the general director of Robinhood's crypto division, the EU has the potential to become an attractive cryptocurrency market due to the new MiCA regulation, which harmonizes rules for the cryptocurrency sector across all 27 member states. The company also announced in June that it has acquired Luxembourg-based cryptocurrency platform Bitstamp for $200 million, with the process expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. Kerbrat hinted at the launch of Robinhood's own stablecoin in September, and the company is currently collaborating with Circle, allowing users to buy and sell USDC without commission.

**Despite SEC tensions, Robinhood eyes stablecoins**
Despite tensions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Robinhood is considering launching its own stablecoin to tap into the growing $170 billion market. The company has been in talks with the SEC for regulatory clarity, but has been met with resistance. According to Dan Gallagher, Robinhood's chief legal, compliance and corporate affairs officer, 'After years of good-faith attempts to work with the SEC for regulatory clarity, including our well-known attempt to 'come in and register,' we are disappointed that the agency has decided to issue a Wells Notice related to our U.S. crypto business.' Meanwhile, other fintech giants like PayPal have entered the stablecoin space, but results have been mixed, with PayPal's stablecoin seeing a 42% plunge on the Solana blockchain network. The U.S. is currently exploring a regulatory framework for stablecoins, while Europe has already implemented regulations through the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) legislation.

**Revolut and Robinhood Eye Stablecoin Market Amid EU Regulation**
Revolut and Robinhood are considering entering the stablecoin market, as the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation may disrupt Tether's dominance in the EU. However, neither company has made any concrete commitments, and there are other competitors. Tether's dominance in the market is significant, with a reported $120 billion in assets under management. The MiCA regulation is expected to enter into force soon, and it includes strict rules for stablecoins. This has created a sense of urgency for companies like Revolut and Robinhood to enter the market. As Thomas Eichenberger, Product Director at Sygnum, said, 'Many companies have observed the Circle and Tether and the numbers they presented. It seemed like an attractive business model, and there are many out there who might want to replicate it.' The stablecoin market is growing globally, especially in emerging economies, and companies like PayPal have already launched their own stablecoins to break the duopoly of Tether and Circle.

**Robinhood and Revolut consider entering stablecoin market**
Robinhood and Revolut are considering entering the stablecoin market, citing increasingly strict regulations that may loosen Tether's dominance. According to anonymous sources, both companies are considering launching their own stablecoins, but may still decide not to proceed. Tether's dominance in the market is due to its first mover advantage, but its lack of transparency around its reserves has raised concerns. Consumer protection group Consumers' Research has criticized Tether's lack of a full audit from a reputable accounting firm, calling it a 'disaster for consumers waiting to happen.' However, with the European Union's new Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework, Tether may be forced to delist its stablecoin from EU exchanges. Circle, the issuer of USD Coin, already holds the necessary license to operate in the EU. Tether's CEO Paolo Ardoino has stated that the company is working on a 'technology-based solution' to serve the EU market. Thomas Eichenberger, chief product officer at Sygnum, noted that many businesses have been attracted to the stablecoin model, which has generated significant profits for Tether, including $5.2 billion in the first half of this year.

**Robinhood explores launching its own stablecoin**
Robinhood has announced that it is exploring the launch of its own stablecoin, a type of crypto designed to maintain stable value. This move could potentially take market share from Tether's USDT, which dominates the stablecoin landscape. However, officials note that the fintech may still decide not to proceed with the offering. Robinhood will continue to focus on meeting customer needs while prioritizing regulatory compliance. The rollout of its own stablecoin would mark an expansion in Robinhood's cryptocurrency business, which has been evolving in terms of trading volume. This trend coincides with the introduction of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework in Europe, which provides emerging guidance on crypto tokens. According to the company's officials, the fintech could still decide not to proceed with the offering, as they will continue to focus on meeting the needs, preferences, and demands of its customers and clients in an ever-evolving market, while also prioritising the process of remaining compliant with the laws and regulatory requirements of the industry, as stated by the company's officials, 'we will continue to focus on meeting the needs, preferences, and demands of its customers and clients in an ever-evolving market, while also prioritising the process of remaining compliant with the laws and regulatory requirements of the industry.'

**Robinhood and Revolut Are Now Considering Promoting Stablecoin - BitRss**
Fintech giants Robinhood and Revolut are considering launching their own stablecoins, but have not yet confirmed final plans. According to sources, the companies are weighing options to enter the fast-growing $170 billion stablecoin market. However, they may never actually launch such a product. The potential launches come amidst regulatory ambiguity in the European Union, where new rules under the Markets in Crypto-Assets framework require stablecoin issuers to have e-money licenses and enact strict reserve requirements. Despite these pressures, the usage of stablecoins is growing outside of crypto exchanges, particularly in emerging markets such as Brazil, Turkey, and Nigeria. As one source noted, 'the lucrative financial incentives that come with stablecoins remain hard to ignore.'
