**The Game Awards Shakes Up Nomination Race With Controversial New Rule**
The Game Awards has introduced a new rule that allows DLCs and expansions to be eligible for major categories, including Game of the Year. This has sparked controversy, as it means that Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, a DLC for the 2022 game Elden Ring, may be nominated for Game of the Year. The rule states that the jury will consider the new creative and technical work, regardless of the format of the content's release. This decision may affect the chances of other games, such as Metaphor: ReFantazio, Astro Bot, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which were previously considered front-runners for the title. As Geoff Keighley said, 'The Game Awards aims to recognize the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that content's release.'

**The Game Awards: Astro Bot a Strong Contender for GOTY**
The Game Awards are approaching, and with it, the highly anticipated 'Game of the Year' (GOTY) award. The ceremony will also cover other categories, such as best game, best narrative, and best vocal performance. The nominees are numerous, including Astro Bot, a PS5 exclusive that has sold 1.5 million copies in just two months, with a score of 18/20 from JV. However, as noted by Polygon, Astro Bot is likely to be nominated in the 'Best Family Game' category, which often struggles to make an impact during the ceremony and win the GOTY award. Other contenders include Metaphor: ReFantazio, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Balatro, Silent Hill 2 (2024), and Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
