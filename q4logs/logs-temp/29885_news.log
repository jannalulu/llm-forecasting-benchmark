**Cesvi: Global Hunger Index 2024 Shows 72 Million People in Acute Food Insecurity**
According to the Global Hunger Index 2024 (GHI), extreme weather events in the past year have worsened hunger levels in 18 countries, pushing over 72 million people into acute food insecurity, 15 million more than in 2022. The GHI is an annual report by Welthungerhilfe and Concern Worldwide, in collaboration with Cesvi and Ifhv. The report highlights that wars and climate crises have caused a 26% increase in malnutrition over the past four years, affecting over 200 million people. If the current trend continues, 582 million people will still be chronically undernourished by 2030, with half of them in Africa. Cesvi emphasizes that 'while the Cop29 is taking place in Baku, the world will only reach a low level of hunger in 2160, more than 130 years from now.' In 2023, there were 399 natural disasters, causing 86,473 deaths and affecting 93.1 million people, resulting in $202.7 billion in economic losses. If no changes are made, 'grain, rice, and maize crops could further decline, particularly affecting rural communities, low-income families, and marginalized groups that are already vulnerable to climate change effects.' The regions most affected are Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. Cesvi is working to address nutritional needs in Somalia through 3 centers providing life-saving nutritional therapies. In Ethiopia, Cesvi supports the population through cash assistance, rehabilitation, and water collection basin restoration projects.

**Colombia's Agonizing Water Crisis: A Global Problem with Local Consequences**
According to the United Nations, 2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to clean water, and by 2030, only 81% of the global population is expected to have access to clean water, while 67% will have access to sanitation services. The climate crisis is a major cause of this water crisis, driven by factors such as deforestation, overexploitation of water resources, and pollution. In Colombia, Bogotá is experiencing a severe water crisis due to low water levels in reservoirs, leading to rationing of the service. A 2022 study by the Ideam found that 207 municipalities in 16 departments were susceptible to water shortages during the dry season. The Colombian government has committed to strengthening its commitments to conserve and restore water ecosystems, as part of the 'Una sola agua' summit in Saudi Arabia in December. 'We must take action to address this crisis, which affects not only our planet but also our future,' said José Consuegra.

**Is South Texas still in extreme drought? Here’s how much more rain we need.**
South Texas is still in extreme drought, despite receiving some meaningful rainfall since November. San Antonio has recorded 1.66 inches of rain this month, but is still 6.09 inches below average for the year. To end the year with average precipitation, San Antonio would need 9.42 inches of rain over the next seven weeks. However, this would likely cause more harm than good, resulting in flooding. Instead, half of that amount, between 4 and 6 inches of rain, would be beneficial in improving drought conditions. The weather forecast for the next week is dry and warm, with temperatures reaching the mid-80s. A cold front may move into the region by late Wednesday or early Thursday, but is expected to be weak and only cool temperatures by a few degrees.

**US Faces Unprecedented Drought Crisis: Agriculture Land Affected in 48 States**
The United States is facing an unprecedented drought crisis, with nearly every state experiencing drought conditions, except Alaska and Kentucky. According to the US Drought Information Portal, over 45% of the country and Puerto Rico are affected, impacting over 150 million people and 318 million acres of crops. Key crops such as corn, sunflower, and durum wheat are severely affected, with 71%, 84%, and 67% of their production areas impacted, respectively. The drought is primarily driven by human-induced greenhouse gas emissions and a global water cycle imbalance. Cities like NYC are facing their worst drought since 1826, with 8.25 million people on drought watch. The US relies on imports to supplement its domestic supply, with key import sources including Mexico, South America, and Canada. The country maintains an agricultural trade surplus, but the gap has narrowed since 2016 due to lower production and faster growth in imports compared to exports.

**October was one of the driest months in history**
October was one of the driest months in American history, with cities such as New York, Houston, Dallas, Philadelphia, and San Francisco not receiving measurable precipitation for 31 days. The dry spell has led to flash drought in surrounding regions, including New Jersey, and has not been seen in the Lower 48 states since December 2022. Forecasters note that areas impacted by hurricanes have dried out rapidly, with some locations recording zero precipitation since the hurricanes. While some precipitation development is expected next week, it may not be enough to ease conditions. The dry season has also led to an increase in wildfires, with 21 large wildfires active nationally and over 883,000 acres burned. As forecasters noted, 'Some precipitation development at the end of the current period could help ease conditions into the next week, but that will be determined on the next map.'

**Southern Africa: Humanitarian Snapshot (As of October 2024) - Zambia**
Over 26 million people in 12 Southern African countries are experiencing crisis levels or worse of food insecurity due to back-to-back climate shocks, including the 2023-2024 El Niño event. Six countries have declared a state of disaster due to severe drought, while 24.8 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. Malnutrition rates have spiked, with an estimated 1.1 million children at risk of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in 2024. Disease outbreaks, including cholera, measles, and mpox, continue to affect the region. A 60% chance of La Niña occurring from September to November is expected to persist through January to March 2025, with normal to above-normal rainfall projected for the region, except for eastern parts. Despite challenges, humanitarians continue to support those in need, but only 30% of the required $1.4 billion has been received to reach 8.3 million people.

**Texas Expects First Frosts and a Mild Winter**
After a very hot summer, Texas is starting to experience a drop in temperatures with the arrival of the first cold fronts. According to the NOAA's annual winter forecast report, the La Niña phenomenon will influence the climate in the coming months, predicting a drier and warmer winter overall. While temperatures are expected to drop in December and February, the NOAA predicts that most of the state will experience temperatures above average. In southern Texas, there is a 60% probability of higher temperatures, while in the north and west, the probability is reduced to 40%. As for precipitation, it is estimated that most of Texas will have a 50-60% probability of below-average rainfall. The Farmer's Almanac also predicts a mild and dry winter for the state as a whole, although some areas may experience more humidity and cold, especially in the Panhandle region, where slightly colder temperatures are expected, especially at the beginning of 2025. Additionally, the first frosts are expected in Texas. The NOAA defines a frost as a drop in temperature to 0°C or less for a couple of hours. Although these phenomena are usually light in most of the state, residents should be aware. It is essential that residents prepare for the change in climate and stay informed about the weather conditions in the coming weeks.

**WFP seeks additional funding for humanitarian response as drought looms in Somalia**
The World Food Programme (WFP) urgently requires 261 million US dollars to expand its humanitarian and resilience programs in Somalia, aiming to alleviate the impacts of a predicted drought through March 2025. Currently, 3.6 million Somalis are facing crisis-level hunger, projected to increase to 4.4 million by December. The WFP said, 'To avert further deterioration of food security and nutrition outcomes across the country, sustained humanitarian assistance, including anticipatory action, is urgently needed.' The appeal follows findings from the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, which highlights that 1.6 million children under the age of five are at risk of acute malnutrition until July 2025. The WFP noted a 14 percent increase in global acute malnutrition and a 21 percent increase in severe acute malnutrition compared to the same season last year. The IPC report aligns with global forecasts indicating an 80 percent probability of La Nina conditions, which could lead to drought in Somalia. The WFP said, 'This is due to anticipated below-average rains, localized flooding in the riverine and urban areas of Hiran, Gedo, Middle Shabelle, and Lower Shabelle, ongoing conflict, high food prices, and diseases contributing to acute food insecurity and malnutrition.'

**DRC: A Quarter of the Population Faces Severe Food Insecurity**
According to the latest analysis of the Integrated Food Security Classification Framework (IPC) by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), approximately 25.6 million people in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which is about 22% of the analyzed population, will face severe food insecurity between July and December 2024. This includes approximately 3.1 million people facing critical levels of food insecurity (IPC phase 4). The projections for early 2025 suggest similar perspectives unless effective aid is provided. Meanwhile, armed violence and competition for resources continue to cause 'massive damage' to livelihoods and rural infrastructure, disrupting essential agricultural production. As stated by the FAO, 'the situation is dire and requires urgent attention.'

**NRC Somalia Country Office Programme Update No. 5 (30 September 2024)**
Somalia is facing a multi-seasonal drought with a high probability of La Niña conditions, threatening food security and agricultural production. Currently, 3.6 million people are facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse levels of food insecurity, projected to rise to 4.4 million by the end of 2024. Conflict, flooding, and drought have forced over 347,000 people to flee their homes in 2024, with 3.8 million people living in protracted displacement. An ongoing cholera outbreak has affected 19,426 people and caused 138 deaths. The 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan for Somalia faces a significant funding gap, with only $593.9 million (37.5%) of the required $1.59 billion secured, leaving a $991.4 million shortfall. NRC Somalia has provided vital assistance to over 367,000 people this year, including over 243,000 reached through an integrated emergency response since January.

**Will Texas Experience Another Harsh Winter in 2024?**
The 2024 winter season is approaching, and Texas is bracing for another potentially harsh winter. In 2021, a severe winter storm caused 24 deaths and left millions without electricity. According to the Old Farmer's Almanac, this year's winter may be even colder, with snowfall intensifying in mid-February. The 2021 winter storm was the worst in Texas history, with temperatures plummeting to -18°C in some areas. President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency in Texas, as the storm affected not only the state but also parts of Mexico. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, the conditions that led to the 2021 disaster could repeat themselves, but it's unclear when or if it will happen. 'We don't know what the future holds, but we're preparing for the worst-case scenario,' said a spokesperson for the Texas government.

**Severe drought now present in SE Texas**
Southeast Texas is experiencing severe drought, with 15% of the region now classified as 'severe drought' and 88% under at least moderate drought. The drought has worsened due to the lack of rainfall, with the last significant rainfall occurring on September 6. The severe drought is particularly concerning in western counties, including Waller, Austin, Washington, and Burleson, while northeast counties such as San Jacinto, Polk, and Trinity are experiencing moderate drought. The Winter Outlook predicts below normal rainfall and above normal temperatures, indicating that the drought is likely to worsen in the coming weeks and months. A La Niña winter is forecasted, which typically leads to dry and warm conditions. If no rainfall occurs next week, it will be the driest October on record for Houston. However, there is a chance of rainfall forecasted for the middle of next week, which would be beneficial to the soil.

**Syria: 2023 IFRC network annual report, Jan-Dec (17 October 2024)**
The Syrian crisis entered its 13th year in March 2023, with 6.9 million people internally displaced and 90% of the population living below the poverty line. The estimated population of Syria reached 22.1 million in 2022, with a Human Development Index (HDI) value of 0.567 in 2020, ranking it 151 out of 189 countries. The February 2023 earthquakes resulted in 5,670 deaths, 11,774 injuries, and affected over eight million people, causing $5.2 billion in physical and economic losses. The disaster exacerbated pre-existing food insecurity, leaving many households unable to access food and livelihoods. As of December 2023, the cost of a food basket had doubled compared to January and had quadrupled in two years. The escalation of hostilities in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank since October 2023 has had spillover effects in Syria, with an increased number of attacks in various parts of the country.

**La Niña could soon arrive. Here's what that means for winter weather in Houston and Southeast Texas**
The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its winter outlook for December 2024 through February 2025, which includes information on likely conditions for Southeast Texas. According to Jon Gottschalck, chief of the Operational Prediction Branch of the Climate Prediction Center, 'This winter, an emerging La Niña is anticipated to influence the upcoming winter patterns, especially our precipitation predictions.' NOAA's Winter Seasonal Outlook calls for above-average temperatures for the south-central U.S., including Houston. However, precipitation conditions are expected to be drier than normal, with Houston potentially seeing only 2-4 inches of total rain from December through February. This could exacerbate the moderate drought conditions already in place for much of Southeast Texas, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.

**Drought in Southern Africa: Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Public Health Situation Analysis (PHSA) (14 October 2024) - Angola**
The 2024 El Niño event has caused widespread drought conditions in southern Africa, affecting countries such as Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The drought has led to severe food shortages, limited access to clean water, disease outbreaks, and loss of livestock. According to FEWS NET estimates, nearly 23 million people are facing high levels of food insecurity, with Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique being the most affected. It is estimated that between 14.0 and 14.9 million people will need urgent humanitarian assistance during the lean season from October to December 2024. The drought has also led to the displacement of thousands of people, disease outbreaks, and significant impacts on agriculture. The situation is further complicated by the ongoing cholera epidemic and the emerging risk of mpox, which may divert resources and response efforts away from the drought response in some affected countries. 'The situation has relatively stabilized', but water shortages are undermining hygiene and sanitation efforts, and the risk of cholera outbreaks remains in countries such as Malawi and Mozambique. The drought may also increase the risk of HIV and AIDS transmission, mental health issues, and gender-based violence, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced preparedness and response mechanisms.

**“Should we be worried?”: Another well blowout in West Texas has a town smelling of rotten eggs**
A well blowout in West Texas has left residents of Toyah, a town of 61 people, smelling of rotten eggs. The blowout, which began nine days ago, is believed to be coming from an abandoned well that exploded. According to Sarah Stogner, an oil and gas attorney, this is at least the eighth time since last October that chemical water has spewed from a well in West Texas without clear ownership. The Railroad Commission of Texas has plugged 737 wells, but critics say the agency is not working fast enough. Residents are dealing with the consequences of decades of lax regulation and enforcement of cleaning up wells after they no longer produce oil or water. Experts say the blowouts like this one will persist as long as oil and gas production continues. The Permian Basin, where Toyah is located, produced 42% of U.S. oil in 2023. 'It's easy to lose faith in state agencies when they're just reactive and are not taking any proactive measures to prevent these (blowouts),' said Dominic DiGiulio, a geoscientist who worked for 31 years at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 'And that's not happening in Texas, it's not happening elsewhere either.'

**Amazonas Drought Affects Over 747,000 People, Government Provides Humanitarian Aid**
The 2024 drought in the Amazonas state of Brazil has affected over 747,642 people, according to the Civil Defense's latest report. This number is higher than the 633,000 people affected in 2023. The drought has left all rivers in the state in a critical situation, with the Rio Negro in Manaus reaching a level of less than one meter from the previous year's record low. The situation is critical in several cities, including Tabatinga, Coari, Parintins, Itacoatiara, and Humaitá. To assist the affected populations, the government has distributed 1,900 tons of food, installed 35 water purifiers, and sent 700 water containers to improve access to clean water. Additionally, 200.3 tons of medicine and medical supplies have been sent to several municipalities, and 37 oxygen cylinders have been sent to Eirunepé, Canutama, and Itamarati, among other places. 'The situation is critical, and we need to act quickly to help the affected populations,' said the government.

**Influx of Population Set to Exacerbate Texas' Lack of Water Issues, Putting Economic Growth at Risk**
The influx of new residents to Texas has exacerbated the state's existing water shortage issue, putting economic growth at risk. According to Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, 'We can't grow, we can't expand, we can't have economic opportunity and jobs without water. We've reached our limit, there is no more.' The state has been in a drought for most of the last two years, with some areas experiencing Stage 4 water restrictions. The water shortage has resulted in the loss of one farm per week, with farmers unable to keep their crops alive due to lack of water. Fixing the water shortage will not be cheap, but not fixing it is also costing the state billions of dollars. State Sen. Charles Perry said, 'It's the silent issue, with the least urgency, with the biggest impact.' The Texas Water Fund, which provided $1 billion to fund water projects, is not enough to address the issue, according to Perry. The state is expected to gain over 22 million people by 2070, making water outages a real concern for Texas in the short term.

**Over 1 million Ugandans at risk from torrential rains**
Uganda is warning that over 1 million people could be affected by torrential rains, which are causing landslides, flooding, and displacement. According to Lilian Aber, minister of state for relief, disaster preparedness and refugees, the country is experiencing heavy rains, strong winds, and hailstorms, leading to widespread waterlogging, flooding, and crop destruction. So far, 25,990 people from 6,650 families have been displaced in the western districts of Ntoroko and Kasese, and 2,010 people in the Mount Elgon region have been displaced due to the threat of landslides. Aber stated, 'The likelihood of more destructive landslides, floods and wind/hailstorms occurring between September and December is very high.' She urged local governments to conduct community sensitization campaigns and warned that the number of people affected will likely exceed 1 million nationwide by December 2024. 'These victims will require relief in the form of food, tents, medicine, and other non-food supplies,' Aber added.

**Low Rains Heighten Food Insecurity For Millions In Somalia**
According to the UN's Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report, nearly five million people in Somalia are facing heightened food insecurity due to insufficient rainfall. The report states that an estimated 1.6 million children aged 6 to 59 months are projected to experience acute malnutrition between August 2024 and July 2025, with around 403,000 expected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition. The IPC also warns that the food security situation is expected to worsen in the projected period from October to December 2024, with 4.4 million individuals facing acute food insecurity, representing 23% of Somalia's total population. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has called for $1.6 billion to fund the 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan in Somalia, but only $507 million has been received as of August 2, leaving a significant gap in resources needed to address the growing crisis.

**US Homelessness May Exceed 653,000 by 2024, a New Record**
According to The Wall Street Journal, the number of homeless people in the US may exceed 653,000 by the end of 2024, a new record. Currently, there are approximately 550,000 homeless individuals, which is about 10% more than the same period last year. This trend suggests that the US will surpass the record of 653,000 homeless people set in 2023. The growing housing prices and high rent have forced families to leave their homes, especially after the pandemic assistance ended. The influx of migrants, brought by buses from Texas to Chicago and Denver, as well as the marginalization of society through drug use, are also contributing factors. Additionally, the decline in the number of working men of working age in the US has led to difficulties in providing for themselves, loss of self-esteem, and mental health problems. The 'opioid epidemic' in the US has also made it difficult for many men to work. In December 2023, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development reported that the number of homeless people in the country exceeded 650,000 in 2022, breaking the historical record. The department attributed this to the increase in housing rent and the inability of the population to afford homes due to low wages.

Widespread Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to persist through at least January 2025 in Somalia. Despite three consecutive seasons of average to above-average rainfall supporting gradual recovery among households badly impacted by the 2020-2022 drought, high food assistance needs persist due to ongoing conflict, severe flooding, high food prices, and limited income-earning opportunities. Humanitarian partners provided food assistance to an average of less than 1.3 million people monthly from June to August 2024, but this assistance covered only approximately 35-40 percent of FEWS NET's estimated population in need of food aid. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in settlements have minimal income-generating opportunities, limited access to food, and depleted coping capacity, with decreasing humanitarian assistance. All settlements hosting displaced populations are expected to face either Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes. The below-average deyr rainfall forecast for the upcoming October to December season is likely to contribute to a fourth consecutive season of below-average crop production, exacerbating food insecurity. Revised analysis indicates that the crop-dependent Sorghum High Potential and Bay Bakool Low Potential livelihood zones are expected to deteriorate to Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with most other agropastoral areas expected to continue facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. In northern and central pastoral areas, improved rangeland conditions, higher livestock birth rates, and increased milk production due to above-average gu rainfall are expected to improve food security for poor households through December. However, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to persist in the Addun and Coastal Deeh Pastoral livelihood zones of the central regions, which were badly impacted during the 2020-2022 drought.

**La Niña: Anticipatory Action and Response Plan, September–December 2024 - Mitigating the expected impacts of La Niña‑induced climate extremes on agriculture and food security**
The 2023-2024 El Niño event significantly impacted over 60 million people globally, causing devastating droughts, heatwaves, and floods. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) initiated anticipatory actions in 24 at-risk countries, followed by emergency response efforts in some of the hardest-hit areas. With the current El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) neutral state, La Niña is anticipated to develop between September and November, with probabilities ranging from 55 to 71 percent, and is expected to persist through January to March 2025. La Niña can increase the likelihood of extreme weather and climate hazards such as droughts, floods, excessive rainfall, and cyclones, which can have severe consequences on food security, particularly for the 282 million people already facing acute food insecurity worldwide. FAO's La Niña Anticipatory Action and Response Plan requires USD 318 million to deliver immediate support to the most at-risk and affected populations, reaching approximately 10.5 million people through the end of 2024. The Plan aims to protect vulnerable people from La Niña-induced disaster impacts, capitalize on the positive spillover effects of La Niña, and deliver early response where La Niña causes devastation.

**How this September's drought levels compare to years prior**
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM), this year's drought levels in Central Texas are significantly reduced compared to years prior. The USDM map, released every Thursday, uses six categories to determine drought severity, including normal, abnormally dry, moderate, severe, extreme, and exceptional. Historically, exceptional drought (D4) has led to widespread crop loss, tree mortality, and water sanitation concerns. In contrast, this September has seen little to no severity in Travis County. Looking back at recent years, three out of the past five years have been mostly drought, with 2023 being the outlier. Last year, 38.71% of the Austin/San Antonio area was under an exceptional drought, making it the second hottest and driest year on record.

**70% of the Population Will Be Affected by Extreme Weather in the Next 20 Years**
According to a new study, approximately 1.5 billion people will suffer from extreme temperatures, rain, and winds in the next 20 years. The study warns that climate change will lead to more intense and frequent extreme weather events. For example, the combination of drought and heatwaves is causing more frequent and intense forest fires worldwide. In 2022, a severe heatwave in Pakistan was followed by unprecedented flooding, affecting millions of people. Brazil is also experiencing the effects of climate change, with the Rio Grande do Sul experiencing historic floods in the first half of the year and the rest of the country facing its worst drought in decades. The researchers state that heatwaves can cause heat stress, excess mortality in humans and livestock, stress on ecosystems, reduced agricultural productivity, and disruptions to energy cooling and transportation. Similarly, extreme precipitation can lead to flooding, damage to settlements, infrastructure, crops, and ecosystems, increased erosion, and reduced water quality.
