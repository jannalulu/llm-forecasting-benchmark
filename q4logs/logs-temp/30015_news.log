The world's richest people saw significant gains in their net worth on Wednesday, following the outcome of the 2024 election.

**Alfonds, heirs of Dexter Shoe Co., now rank among wealthiest Americans**
The Alfond siblings, Susan, Ted, and Bill, have made it to the Forbes list of billionaires with a net worth of $3.3 billion each. They are ranked No. 388 in the US and No. 1,053 globally. Their wealth comes from the Dexter Shoe Co., which was established by their father, Harold Alfond, and sold to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway in 1993 for $420 million in stock. According to Buffett, the purchase was the 'worst deal that I've made' and 'compounded this error hugely' as it made the cost to Berkshire shareholders $3.5 billion. The siblings' wealth has increased significantly due to the rise in stock valuations over the past three decades, with the S&P 500 index up 12-fold since 1993. Elon Musk topped the Forbes billionaires' list with a net worth of $265.2 billion, followed by Jeff Bezos with $215.9 billion.

**Forbes' List of the World's Richest People: Elon Musk Tops the List**
The Forbes list of the world's richest people for September 2024 has been influenced by the fluctuations in the technology sector.
