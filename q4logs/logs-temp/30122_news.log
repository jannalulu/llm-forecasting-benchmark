**Netanyahu under investigation for allegedly altering cabinet meeting minutes amid ICC, ICJ scrutiny   - NaturalNews.com**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under investigation for allegedly altering cabinet meeting minutes amid international scrutiny from the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The investigation stems from reports that Netanyahu edited transcripts of high-level security meetings during the Gaza war to obscure or distort conversations regarding Israel's military response to Hamas. This comes as Israel faces significant legal challenges, including ICC consideration of arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over allegations of war crimes. South Africa has also filed a case at the ICJ accusing Israel of breaching the Genocide Convention during its military operations in Gaza. Netanyahu's office has dismissed allegations of altering meeting minutes as a 'web of lies' aimed at undermining his government, while his chief of staff, Tzachi Braverman, has denied allegations of blackmailing a military officer into altering records. Critics accuse Netanyahu of using his power to delay military action or prolong the Gaza conflict to distract from his legal troubles and prevent his governing coalition from collapsing.

**Seeing Through the Fog of Justice in Israel and Palestine**
The conflict in the Middle East is plagued by misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda. This article aims to dispel false claims about the International Criminal Court (ICC) and its investigation into the situation in Palestine. Contrary to claims by Israel, the United States, and others, the ICC has jurisdiction over both Israeli officials and Palestinian leaders. In 2015, Palestine became a member-state of the ICC, and in 2021, judges determined that the ICC Prosecutor has jurisdiction over Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. As a state recognized by 149 of 193 UN member states, Palestine has the right to have its citizens investigated by the ICC, regardless of where their atrocities are perpetrated. 'The Court also has jurisdiction over any atrocities committed on Palestinian territory, irrespective of the perpetrator's nationality,' according to the ICC's jurisdiction. Former Canadian Justice Minister Irwin Cotler's claim that the ICC has jurisdiction over Palestinian citizens but not Israeli ones is false. 'These claims are false,' the article states, emphasizing the ICC's jurisdiction over both Israeli officials and Palestinian leaders.

**Israel questions ICC judge's impartiality in Netanyahu arrest case**
Israel has questioned the impartiality of International Criminal Court judge Beti Hohler, who is reviewing a request for arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others. The Office of the Attorney-General of Israel stated that Hohler had previously worked for the Office of the Prosecutor, and 'respectfully requests that judge Beti Hohler provide information to clarify whether there are (or are not) grounds to reasonably doubt her impartiality.' The court's chief prosecutor had filed a request in May for arrest warrants against Netanyahu and others, citing reasonable grounds to believe they had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. The case has been delayed due to several rounds of legal filings by Israel challenging the court's jurisdiction, and the replacement of Romanian magistrate Iulia Motoc with Hohler. The court has no set deadlines, but generally takes about three months to rule on requests for arrest warrants.

**Israel challenges ICC judge's bias in Benjamin Netanyahu case**
Israel has challenged the impartiality of International Criminal Court (ICC) Judge Beti Hohler, who is part of a panel deciding whether to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel's Office of the Attorney-General stated, 'Israel respectfully requests that Judge Beti Hohler provide information to clarify whether there are (or are not) grounds to reasonably doubt her impartiality.' The request comes after Hohler replaced Romanian magistrate Iulia Motoc, who cited health grounds to leave the panel. The ICC's chief prosecutor filed a request in May for arrest warrants against Netanyahu, Israel's then-defense minister, and three Hamas leaders over the Gaza war. The court has no set deadlines, but previous cases have taken around three months to rule on requests for arrest warrants.

**Could Trump’s Victory Spur ICC to Quickly Issue Arrest Warrant Against Netanyahu?**
Donald Trump's electoral victory raises questions about its impact on ongoing wars in Gaza, Lebanon, and beyond. It also sparks concerns that the International Criminal Court (ICC) may issue arrest warrants against Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, before Trump returns to the White House in January. ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan announced in May that he would seek arrest warrants against Netanyahu, former defense minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders on war crimes charges. Khan accused Netanyahu and Gallant of targeting civilians in Gaza and using starvation as a weapon of war, charges Israel rejects. He accused the Hamas leaders of crimes against humanity during the war and the assault that sparked it on October 7, 2023. 'Khan accused Netanyahu and Gallant of targeting civilians in Gaza and using starvation as a weapon of war — charges Israel rejects.'

**Netanyahu concerned ICC to issue arrest warrant before Trump takes office**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is concerned that the International Criminal Court (ICC) will issue a warrant for his arrest before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan has asked for warrants for Netanyahu, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas leaders for crimes against humanity and war crimes. An Israeli Prime Minister's Office official called Khan's actions 'outrageous' and 'dangerous,' and said that the prosecutor had promised not to seek arrests before conducting an investigation in Israel. The official also called for more transparency. The House passed the Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act, sanctioning ICC employees over Khan's pursuit of arrest warrants, but the bill has been awaiting a Senate vote. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's spokesperson said he continues to support bipartisan negotiations on responding to the ICC. Republicans in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have held up all other committee matters until there is a vote on the ICC sanctions.

**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge in Netanyahu Case, Causing Further Delays**
The International Criminal Court announced on Friday that it has replaced one of the judges who will preside over the request to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a move that may lead to further delays in the case, according to Reuters. The prosecutors in May requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders, saying there were reasonable grounds to believe they committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court's president said that the Roman judge, Julia Motoc, requested to be replaced due to health reasons on Friday, and was immediately replaced by Slovenian judge, Bettina Holzer. This replacement is expected to lead to further delays in issuing a decision on potential arrest warrants in the case, which involves the conflict in the Gaza Strip, as the new judge will need time to familiarize herself with all the case documents. There is no specific time limit for the court, but it has generally taken around 3 months to decide on requests for arrest warrants in previous cases. The decision has already been delayed due to several rounds of legal challenges from Israel, which has questioned the court's jurisdiction.

**International Criminal Court to Change Judge in Netanyahu Case**
The International Criminal Court announced on Friday that it will change one of the judges who will preside over the request of the prosecution to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The request was made by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, on May 20, to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant for their responsibility for 'war crimes and crimes against humanity' committed by the Israeli army in Gaza since October 7, 2023. The President of the Court stated that 'the President of the Court in that case, Judge Julia Motoc from Romania, requested a substitute for herself for health reasons today, and was immediately replaced by Judge Bettina Holzer from Slovenia.' This development is expected to further delay the Court's decision on the request to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant. The Israeli Channel 12 reported on Friday that the delay is likely to be longer due to Judge Holzer's need to review the legal details of the case. Israel submitted documents to the Court on September 20, challenging the request of the prosecutor, Karim Khan, to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu. The Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Oran Margaliot, stated that 'the State of Israel has submitted its official challenge to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the legality of the requests of the prosecutor to issue arrest warrants for the Prime Minister of Israel and the Minister of Defense.' The International Criminal Court is the only independent court in the world established to investigate the most serious crimes, including genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. However, it relies on member states to enforce arrest warrants and does not have a police force of its own.

**World News | One of 3 Judges Weighing Request for ICC Arrest Warrants Against Netanyahu, Others Replaced | LatestLY**
The presiding judge of the International Criminal Court panel considering a request to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defence minister, and senior Hamas leaders has been replaced on medical grounds. Romanian judge Iulia Motoc was replaced by Slovenian judge Beti Hohler. The decision is likely to further delay a decision on the request by the court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, who accused Netanyahu and others of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip and Israel. Netanyahu called the accusations a 'disgrace', while US President Joe Biden called the request for warrants 'outrageous'. Hamas also denounced the ICC prosecutor's actions, saying the request to arrest its leaders 'equates the victim with the executioner'. Israel is not a member of the court, so even if the arrest warrants are issued, Netanyahu and his defence minister do not face any immediate risk of prosecution.

**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge Reviewing Netanyahu Arrest Warrant Request**
The International Criminal Court has replaced a Romanian judge who was reviewing a request to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu due to health reasons. This comes amid Israel's campaign against the International Criminal Court after it moved to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his Defense Minister. Earlier, reports in Hebrew media indicated an unusual statement from the International Criminal Court in The Hague, following reports that the prosecutor Karim Khan is being investigated for alleged sexual harassment of a colleague. Channel 12 reported that the International Criminal Court confirmed that a complaint has been received by the investigation committee against Prosecutor Karim Khan, accusing him of sexual harassment of a colleague. It is worth noting that Prosecutor Karim Khan requested the issuance of arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three leaders of Hamas for committing war crimes.

**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge Who Was Preparing to Issue Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has replaced a judge who was preparing to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The court cited 'health reasons' for the decision. The ICC had previously requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu in May for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. The prosecutor, Karim Khan, stated that there were 'reasonable grounds' to believe that Netanyahu was responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. An arrest warrant was also requested for Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes. The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include 'causing genocide, causing famine as a means of warfare, including preventing humanitarian aid, and intentionally targeting civilians in the conflict'. The ICC has the authority to prosecute individuals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The court has issued arrest warrants in the past, including one for Russian President Vladimir Putin for alleged war crimes. However, the ICC only intervenes when national authorities are unable or unwilling to stop crimes.

**ICC Delays on Netanyahu Arrest Warrant Raise Questions about Independence and Jurisdiction**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has been deliberating on the arrest warrants requested by prosecutor Karim Khan for crimes committed in Israel and Gaza since October 7, 2023. The warrants target Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defense minister Yoav Gallant, and if evidence of his death is not found, Mohammed Deif, the head of the Hamas military branch. The three judges' delays have raised questions about their independence and the relevance of the ICC's jurisdiction. According to Professor Adil Haque, 'if in themselves arrest warrants do not stop crimes, they could have a real effect on the ground and potentially save many lives.' The ICC has allowed dozens of states, lawyers, and think tanks, including some from Christian evangelical lobbies and far-right Western groups, to submit a brief on the case. Israel has also intervened in the proceedings, submitting two briefs to the judges, one contesting the ICC's jurisdiction and the other requesting that the case be referred to Israeli courts. Israel claims it can try the alleged perpetrators of international law violations in Gaza on its own soil, hoping to avoid ICC prosecution. An observer of the ICC notes that 'if Israel participates, it's likely that they have obtained a guarantee' of a favorable outcome. Meanwhile, the ICC has not issued arrest warrants for Yahya Sinouar and Ismael Haniyeh, despite being requested by the prosecutor. Sinouar, the former head of Hamas, was killed by the Israeli army in Gaza on October 16. 'I would have liked to see Yahya Sinouar, Ismael Haniyeh, and Mohammed Deif appear before the ICC,' said UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese. US President Joe Biden welcomed Sinouar's death, stating that 'no terrorist, anywhere in the world, can escape justice.'

**Who is preventing ICC from arresting Netanyahu?**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has not issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, despite Attorney General Karim Khan requesting it in May 2022. Khan stated that the evidence in the case was sufficient for the court to issue an arrest warrant, but four months later, no decision has been taken. Critics argue that the court is facing pressure from the US and other Western countries, which have threatened to impose sanctions or even invade the Netherlands, where the ICC is based. Former prosecutor Fatou Bensouda was subjected to similar pressure, and Khan has reported being under pressure not to investigate Israeli politicians. The ICC's Chief Prosecutor Khan has called on the court to hurry up and issue the arrest warrants, stating that there is no legal obstacle in the matter. The situation has led to mistrust in the international community, especially among Palestinians, and undermines confidence in law, courts, and justice.

**Netanyahu Expects International Arrest Warrants to be Issued Against Him Soon**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that he expects international arrest warrants to be issued against him soon. According to Channel 13, Netanyahu told the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee in the Knesset that he believes international arrest warrants will be issued against him and other officials in the near future. This comes after the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim Khan, requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in May for their alleged involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. Khan has made similar requests three times since May, and has urged the ICC to act quickly and without delay. Israel has not recognized the ICC's jurisdiction and has continued to defy its rulings, including a recent decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. Netanyahu has stated that Israel is going through 'fateful days' and has dismissed questions from the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee about the possibility of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's dismissal. 'It was a human error', a spokesperson for the Israeli Foreign Ministry said, explaining that the ministry had published a statement condemning the ICC's decision, only to later retract it. The ministry had published the statement on its website and on social media, but quickly removed it. Netanyahu's statement comes as Israel continues to defy international pressure to end its war in Gaza, which has been ongoing for 18 years and has left over 2 million Palestinians in dire conditions.

**Israel Announces Formal Appeal to International Criminal Court**
Israel has announced a formal appeal to the International Criminal Court against the request of the prosecutor, Karim Khan, to issue an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This move comes in a tense context where the world is watching the developments in Gaza and the surrounding areas. Israel's government, through its foreign ministry spokesperson, Oran Margaliot, confirmed that it has submitted a formal appeal against the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the legitimacy of the prosecutor's requests. This appeal includes a legal challenge to the credibility of the actions taken by the court, with Israeli officials arguing that they do not have the right to consider this case. In July, the International Criminal Court gave more than 60 governments and legal organizations the opportunity to present their arguments regarding the proposed arrest warrants against Netanyahu and a group of other officials from both sides involved in the conflict. This move reflects a response to a call for action from within the international community in the face of the ongoing escalation of some conflicts in the region. The controversy surrounding the International Criminal Court has been ongoing, with many experts expressing doubts about its ability to enforce justice in complex international conflicts. Some experts believe that the court's actions may be sensitive to international policies. International reactions have been varied, with some countries viewing the request as a sign of interest in holding accountable those who may have committed crimes, while others see it as an unacceptable interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states. Reactions have been mixed, adding to the complexity of the legal and political context. In light of this escalation, Israeli officials have emphasized the importance of protecting their leaders from international legal threats, which could affect the country's political and economic situation. On the other hand, these developments highlight the need to address conflicts comprehensively, rather than through legal pursuits that may not address the underlying issue. In conclusion, Israel's moves to challenge the arrest warrants reflect a comprehensive legal and security strategy that shows the government's efforts to protect its leaders in the face of challenges that could affect the region's stability and security. Developments in this case will continue to be watched by the world, with more legal and political discussions expected about the role of the International Criminal Court.

**Israel Challenges ICC Request for Netanyahu Arrest Warrant**

According to Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oran Margaliot, 'Israel has submitted its official challenge to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the legitimacy of the prosecutor's request to issue arrest warrants for the Israeli Prime Minister and Defense Minister.' The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, had requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Gantz on May 20, 2024, citing evidence that they are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Palestinian territories (in the Gaza Strip) since at least October 8, 2023. Khan emphasized that any delay in the proceedings would negatively impact the rights of the victims. He urged judges to make a decision quickly without delay, saying, 'Any unjustified delay in these proceedings will have a negative impact on the rights of the victims.'
