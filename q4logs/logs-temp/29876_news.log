**Framing the Future: Who Will Be Iceland's Next Prime Minister?**
Icelanders, we need to think about our next step! Who will be the next prime minister after the elections? Which individual and party is likely to lead a three-party coalition, rather than a four-party coalition? Let's examine the leading candidates of each party and ask ourselves who is most likely to succeed. I'm not sure, but Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson is likely to be at the forefront. He showed this in 2016 when Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson resigned, and everything fell into place quickly, allowing the people to assess Sigurður Ingi's work. With him, we can expect ministers who have earned a good reputation. Lilja Dögg Alfreðsdóttir, the party's deputy leader, has made significant contributions to culture and the arts. Lilja has been a spokesperson for the Icelandic language and has '...'

**Bjarni Benediktsson Rules Out Participation in EU-Advocating Government**
Bjarni Benediktsson, chairman of the Independence Party, stated in a debate on Stöð 2 that he would not participate in a government that would advocate for Iceland's entry into the European Union. He said, 'I see no reason for entry into the EU.' Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, chairman of the Centre Party, asked Bjarni if he would consider giving something in exchange for the EU's entry, but Bjarni replied that he would not take part in a government that would fight for entry into the EU. This statement suggests that Bjarni is not opposed to taking part in a government that aligns with the Independence Party's stance on the EU.

**Bjarni Benediktsson: 'It's not the outcome of the elections that it will be one in ten, that is ruled out.'**
Bjarni Benediktsson, the leader of the Independence Party, is confident of winning the upcoming elections despite recent polls showing a 12% support rate. He says it's impossible to predict the outcome of the elections based on current polls, and that the party's strategy is to focus on its good candidates and message. Benediktsson emphasizes that the party's goal is to win the elections, and that he trusts in the party's ability to do so. He points out that other polls have shown different results, and that he believes the party can win the elections despite the current polls. Benediktsson says, 'It is not the outcome of the elections that it will be one in ten, that is ruled out. We find that when we are talking to people and I can refer to other polls that show a different outcome. I still believe that we can win these elections, despite such polls at this time.'

**Independence Party Candidates Gaining Momentum Ahead of Elections**
Bjarni Benediktsson, the Prime Minister and leader of the Independence Party, says that the party's candidates are gaining momentum ahead of the upcoming parliamentary elections on November 30. 'It's great to find the strength in the party under these circumstances. We had a very large and strong constituency assembly all over the country last weekend and were in first place in all constituencies outside of Reykjavik. I hear and find that there is a renewed energy in the party members and a great fighting spirit,' says Bjarni to mbl.is. When asked about criticism that the party is only attracting famous people to their list, Bjarni responds: 'Everyone will have to sing this with their own name. I just hope that voters will mainly consider the issues and what people stand for, rather than whether they have been famous in some context. But famous people can also do a lot of good if they have good ideas,' says Bjarni. The party is focusing on ideas and policies, and Bjarni says that he is pleased to have attracted experienced politicians from various constituencies, including those with experience in local government and the private sector. 'When it all comes down to it, it's about ideas and policies. I'm happy to have gotten a mix of ongoing and new representation for many strong politicians in the Independence Party. We will focus on the issues,' says Bjarni.

**Iceland to elect new parliament on Nov. 30, president says**
Iceland will hold a parliamentary election on November 30, according to the president, after the three-party coalition government collapsed due to disagreements over asylum policies, energy efficiency, and other issues. The coalition, led by Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson, had been in place since April, but ultimately fell apart. Iceland has been facing uncertainty due to recent volcanic eruptions, high inflation, and interest rates. As the country prepares for the election, it remains to be seen how the new government will address these challenges. 'The coalition of the right-wing, pro-business Independence Party, the centre-right Progressive Party and the Left Greens, fell apart over disagreements ranging from asylum policies to energy efficiency,' said Prime Minister Benediktsson. The presidency was won by Halla Tomasdottir in August, who took office after Katrin Jakobsdottir announced her resignation and run for president.

**Bjarni Benediktsson to Request Dissolution of Parliament**
Bjarni Benediktsson, the Prime Minister and leader of the Independence Party, stated that he will request a dissolution of parliament for himself and his cabinet. This was mentioned in an interview with Bjarni on Ríkisútvarpið (the Icelandic national broadcaster) earlier today. He recalled saying yesterday that he would request a dissolution of parliament if an agreement on cooperation between the government parties could not be reached before the party elections. 'If an agreement is not reached, I will request a dissolution of parliament and we can then form a caretaker government at the President's request,' Bjarni said yesterday. Bjarni stated tonight that he finds it unpleasant to think that a caretaker government would be formed with a new Prime Minister, as proposed by Svandís Svavarsdóttir, the leader of the Left-Green Party. However, he expressed a desire for a caretaker government to be formed. The same ministers would continue to serve in their positions until the elections, and it would be possible to pass the budget in this manner.

**Iceland PM Benediktsson dissolves parliament, calls for elections on November 30**
Iceland's Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson announced the dissolution of parliament on Sunday, citing growing disagreements between the governing parties on asylum seekers and energy efficiency. Benediktsson called for elections to be held on November 30, as required by law 45 days after the dissolution of parliament is announced. The decision comes after the coalition government faced uncertainty due to recent volcanic eruptions, high inflation, and soaring interest rates. Benediktsson, head of the right-wing Independence Party, was elected in April and has been under pressure to address the country's economic challenges. 'Growing disagreements between the three governing parties on issues regarding asylum seekers and energy efficiency' led to the decision, according to Benediktsson. He will meet with Icelandic President Halla Tomasdottir on Monday to discuss the decision. 'The coalition government has faced uncertainty after recent volcanic eruptions forced thousands to leave their homes, putting pressure on an economy already facing high inflation and soaring interest rates,' the article states. Elections must take place at the latest 45 days after the dissolution of parliament is announced, according to Icelandic public broadcaster RUV.

**Icelandic Government Coalition Collapses, Early Elections Called**
Icelandic Prime Minister Bjarne Benediktsson announced the collapse of the governing coalition and called for early elections on November 30. According to RUV, Benediktsson blamed the growing disagreements between the three leading parties on various issues, including foreign policy and refugee problems. Benediktsson will meet with President Halldora Thorisdottir on Monday to discuss the decision to dissolve the parliament. Elections must take place no later than 45 days after the announcement of the parliament's dissolution. Benediktsson, the head of the right-wing business party Independence Party, was elected prime minister in April, replacing Katrin Jakobsdottir. The coalition government, consisting of the Independence Party, the right-wing Progressive Party, and the Green Party, has faced uncertainty since recent volcanic eruptions forced thousands of people to leave their homes and put pressure on the economy, which is already struggling with high inflation and rising interest rates. To hold early elections, President Halldora Thorisdottir must accept the proposal to dissolve the parliament, as Benediktsson said, 'It is time for a new government to take responsibility for the country's future.'

**Iceland's Prime Minister Dissolves Ruling Coalition**
Iceland's Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson announced the dissolution of the ruling coalition on an unexpected press conference in the capital Reykjavik. The reason for the breakup, according to Benediktsson, is the growing disagreements between the three political parties in the coalition. 'There are disagreements over asylum seeker policy, which have become public, and long-standing disagreements over the vision for energy efficiency,' he said. Benediktsson stated that new parliamentary elections should take place on November 30 if President Halla Tomasdottir accepts his proposal to dissolve the parliament. The National Broadcasting Service RUV reported that elections should take place no later than 45 days after the parliament's dissolution. Benediktsson is set to meet with Tomasdottir on Monday. The coalition government consists of Benediktsson's conservative Independence Party, the centrist Progressive Party, and the left-wing 'green' party. Svandis Svavarsson, Minister of Infrastructure and leader of the 'green' party, said that the decision to dissolve the parliament was unexpected and not discussed during her meeting with Benediktsson on Saturday. 'I thought we were meeting honestly, discussing the situation, and possibly returning to look at specific issues. I thought we understood that the most important issues were the economy, housing, and the problems faced by ordinary people who are struggling to make ends meet. I thought this was our most pressing issue, but now we see that for the Prime Minister, other issues are more important,' she said.

The government coalition consisted of the Independence Party, the Left-Green Movement, and the Progress Party (center-right).

**Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson Faces Questions in Samtalið**
Bjarni Benediktsson, the Prime Minister of Iceland and leader of the Independence Party, will be interviewed in the new national language program 'Samtalið' on Vísir and Stöð 2/Vísir at 14:00 today. The program will also be broadcast on Stöð 2 at 19:10 tonight. The program is a new national language program that will be on the schedule every Friday in the winter. Many questions are being asked of Bjarni Benediktsson, who has been the leader of the Independence Party for the longest period of time, 15 years. He leads a government that has been controversial since the start of the previous government of the Left-Green Party, Independence Party, and Progressive Party. Growing dissatisfaction has been felt in the government coalition since it was renewed after the 2021 elections, with some saying that the government cannot maintain its position with the dissatisfaction that reigns within it. Support for the government has decreased significantly, and according to polls, it is on the verge of collapse. The support for the Independence Party has also decreased, with the party's support now at 14%. Many controversial issues are waiting to be addressed in the Althing this last parliamentary session before the elections, with 217 government bills on the agenda. It appears that within the government, there will be a discussion about energy and power issues, foreigner issues, and issues related to the constitution in the country. According to the electoral law, the next parliamentary elections should take place in September next year. Elections were held in the autumn of 2016 after Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson resigned as Prime Minister before the end of the term and the elections, and in the autumn of 2017 after the government of Bjarni Benediktsson collapsed after only ten months. The current coalition parties, which formed a government after the 2017 elections, decided to serve out the term, so that for the third time in a row, elections were held in the autumn of 2021. Now, many are wondering whether the coalition parties will call for elections next spring, as it has been a tradition for parliamentary elections to take place in the spring. This question and many others will be discussed in the live broadcast of Samtalið on Vísir and Stöð 2/Vísir at 14:00 today.
