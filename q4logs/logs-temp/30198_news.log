**USDA Launches Investigation into Handling of Boar's Head Listeria Outbreak**
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has initiated an internal investigation into how the agency handled reports of severe problems at a Boar's Head deli meat plant linked to a deadly listeria outbreak. According to Senator Richard Blumenthal, the USDA's inspector general, Phyllis Fong, is reviewing whether federal investigators and Virginia state inspectors responded adequately to dozens of reports of problems at the plant, including mold, insects, water leaks, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors, and equipment. The inspection reports from at least two years ago indicated that the conditions posed an 'imminent threat' to food safety. Blumenthal said in a statement, 'The USDA took virtually no action - allowing Boar's Head to continue its normal operations in its Virginia plant, chronically unsanitary - despite finding repeated severe violations.' At least 10 people have died and nearly 50 have been hospitalized in 19 states since May after consuming Boar's Head products contaminated with listeria, including liver sausages. After recalling over 2 million pounds of distributed products nationwide, Boar's Head closed its Jarratt, Virginia plant and permanently stopped producing liver sausages.

Connecticut lawmakers have called for consequences after the listeria outbreak death toll reached 10, labeling Boar's Head's lack of action as 'unacceptable'. The company's factory in Virginia was closed indefinitely after an investigation found outdated practices, including insects, mold, and poor facilities. The USDA was aware of the issues in 2022, but the new head of sanitation, Terrence Boyce, faced pushback from management and was terminated after eight months. The listeria outbreak has been deemed the largest in the nation since 2011, with deaths occurring in eight states. The CDC urges consumers to check their food and ensure it does not belong to the recalled products, which are labeled 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' and have sell-by dates of Oct. 2024.

**Boar's Head Listeriosis Outbreak Linked to Tenth Death, Lawmakers Demand Investigation**
A tenth person has died due to a listeriosis outbreak linked to a Boar's Head factory in Virginia. This comes after a national recall of potentially contaminated meats from the company. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), since the last update in late August, two more cases and one additional death have been reported. As of September 23, a total of 59 people in 19 states have been infected with the epidemic strain of Listeria, all of whom required hospitalization. The CDC warned that the number of reported cases of the disease may increase, as it can take up to 10 weeks for some people to show symptoms of listeriosis. Some lawmakers are now calling for the US Department of Agriculture and the Department of Justice to investigate whether Boar's Head should face criminal charges. 'It is unacceptable that Boar's Head has not taken sufficient measures to correct these conditions that have led to repeated violations for similar problems,' wrote Senator Richard Blumenthal and Representative Rosa DeLauro in a letter sent to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Attorney General Merrick Garland. 'It is high time to act and we urge your agencies to work together to obtain immediate justice for the affected consumers and to prevent this from happening again.' Boar's Head responded to a request for comment by referring Quartz to a statement from the company, which was last updated on September 13. 'We understand the gravity of this situation and the profound impact it has had on the affected families,' the company said. 'Global measures are being taken to prevent such an incident from happening again.' Boar's Head had earlier this month announced that it would be 'indefinitely' closing its Virginia sausage factory, which was linked to a deadly listeriosis outbreak this summer. The transformation of liver sausage was the source of contamination and will be permanently stopped, the company added. Federal inspectors had found dozens of infractions at the Boar's Head facility in Virginia, which is now closed. Inspectors from the US Department of Agriculture reported at least 69 non-compliance violations, including mold, water puddles, and the presence of insects near food, according to records obtained by CBS News through a Freedom of Information Act request. Listeria monocytogenes can cause severe listeriosis infections in young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. It is estimated that in the US, 1,600 people contract listeriosis each year, with approximately 260 annual deaths, according to the CDC.

**Boar's Head Confirms Tenth Death in Listeria Outbreak, Recalls Meat Product**
Boar's Head has confirmed the tenth death related to the listeria outbreak linked to their recalled meat product. The company has acknowledged that the actual number of cases may be higher due to various factors, such as delayed testing and delayed reporting. Symptoms of listeria infection can take up to 10 weeks to appear. Boar's Head has suspended sales of their liver sausage and closed their Virginia plant, which was linked to the outbreak. The company has also implemented a corporate food safety program. In a letter to consumers, Boar's Head expressed their 'unwavering commitment to our customers and the safety and quality of our products.' They stated that they are determined to learn from this incident and emerge stronger. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that consumers check their homes for recalled products with the code 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA mark, with expiration dates up to October 2024. Listeria bacteria cause listeriosis, the third leading cause of foodborne illness in the US. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, and fatigue. Infection can also lead to neck stiffness, headaches, confusion, or seizures. While the outbreak is linked to Boar's Head's liver sausage, maintaining overall health and well-being remains crucial. Regularly checking expiration dates and following food safety guidelines can help prevent listeria infections.

**Boar's Head Suspends Liverwurst Sales Amid Listeria Outbreak**
The authorities have acknowledged that the number of listeria cases is likely higher than reported due to various factors. It can take up to 10 weeks for listeria symptoms to appear, some individuals who fall ill are not tested, and linking a disease to an outbreak can take weeks. Boar's Head has considered this listeria outbreak a concerning chapter in their past and has decided to suspend sales of their liverwurst after an investigation revealed their production process as the cause of contamination. As part of their response, they have closed the Virginia plant linked to the outbreak and established a company-wide food safety program. The Jarratt, Virginia plant has been offline since last July, when the liverwurst recall was initially announced and later expanded to include all products made there. Boar's Head has expressed their unwavering commitment to their customers and the safety and quality of their products in a letter to consumers. They are determined to learn from this incident and come out stronger. The CDC advises consumers to check their homes for recalled products, which bear the 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA inspection mark on the labels and have expiration dates up to October 2024. Listeria bacteria cause listeriosis, the third deadliest foodborne illness in the US. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, and fatigue. An infection can also cause neck stiffness, headache, confusion, or seizures. Despite the outbreak being linked to Boar's Head's liverwurst, promoting overall health and wellness remains crucial during this time. Regularly checking food expiration dates and adhering to food safety guidelines can help prevent listeria infections.
