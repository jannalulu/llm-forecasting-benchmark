**Waymo Launches Fully Autonomous Taxi Service in Los Angeles**
Waymo, a Google-affiliated autonomous driving company, has launched its fully autonomous taxi service, Waymo One, in Los Angeles. The service, which was previously only available to those on a waiting list, is now accessible to anyone through a dedicated app. The service operates in a 200 square kilometer area, including Hollywood, USC, Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, and Long Beach, with plans to expand to cover a wider area of the city. According to Waymo's Co-CEO, Tekedra Mawakana, 'We're thrilled to share this amazing experience with the people of Los Angeles. Our service has matured rapidly, and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving.' Los Angeles is the third city to have Waymo's robotaxi service go public, with a population of over 3.8 million people, making it the largest city to do so. Waymo currently operates its autonomous driving services in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Phoenix, with plans to increase ridership in these cities by 2x by August 2024. As of November 2024, Waymo's robotaxi service has seen a significant increase in usage, with over 150,000 rides per week across all cities, up from 50,000 in May 2024 and 100,000 in August 2024.

**RTD considers cuts as cost of Access-on-Demand skyrockets**
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) in Denver is considering cuts to its Access-on-Demand program, which provides free taxpayer-subsidized rides on Uber and other commercial services for people with disabilities. The program has seen a tenfold increase in ridership since its launch in 2020, but the monthly cost has ballooned to over $1 million. RTD managers have begun reducing rideshare costs and are considering further cuts, including reducing the monthly rides allotment to 30 and requiring riders to pay a base fare of $5. Disability rights activists are urging RTD leaders to reconsider cuts and to weigh in with Uber and Lyft to ensure that drivers accept riders with service animals. 'Transportation is something everyone needs or they become prisoners in their homes,' said Curtis Chong, a longtime member of the National Federation of the Blind. 'If our society and the RTD can do it, they ought to keep this program going.'

**New To Texas in 2025, Armed Driver Ridesharing App**
A new ridesharing app called BlackWolf is set to launch in Texas in 2025, offering an extra layer of safety with armed drivers. The app, which has already gained popularity in other states, allows passengers to choose from three tiers of safety, including drivers with law enforcement, military, or security experience. According to the company, the goal is to have 35-50 drivers in each market before launching, with plans to roll out service in Austin, Houston, and Dallas. BlackWolf is currently operating in Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, and Arizona, and will cost around 10-15% more than other ridesharing apps. As safety and security continue to be a concern in some Texas cities, it will be interesting to see if BlackWolf 'explodes' in popularity.

Competitor Waymo paid millions for testing permits in California, and Tesla has not applied for a testing permit to operate driverless vehicles. This raises questions about whether Elon Musk can meet the 2025 timeline. 'Things are not going to be smooth for Tesla in California,' as they try to gain the necessary permits. Tesla last used its autonomous vehicle test permit in 2019, which required the assistance of a safety driver.
