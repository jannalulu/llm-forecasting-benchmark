**La Niña expected to deliver warmer, drier South Florida winter**
A weak and short-lived La Niña is expected to emerge in December, leading to a warmer and drier winter in South Florida. According to Robert Molleda, chief meteorologist for the National Weather Service's Miami office, 'So warmer and drier from now all the way through April. In fact, the models are indicating that it's possible that the February to April period could tilt a little drier.' La Niñas typically push the jet stream further north, resulting in less stormy weather. The region is in good shape for water supply, but water managers are keeping an eye on Lake Okeechobee, the primary dry season source for freshwater. The Army Corps will allow the lake to recede to help it recover from high wet season levels, said Maj. Cory Bell, district deputy commander for the Corps' Jacksonville District. 'As we move forward in the dry season, we're looking at lake recovery operations, and we will communicate that with our stakeholders,' he said. With a rainy season delivering about 120% of normal rainfall, water restrictions look unlikely, according to South Florida Water Management District officials.
