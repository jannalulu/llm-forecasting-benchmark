**FOLLOW-UP: Washington Background Checks Back Online...But**
The Washington State Patrol's background check system is back online after a two-week outage, but gun owners and retailers remain frustrated. WSP spokesman Chris Loftis said, 'WSP Firearms Background staff will take this next week to get caught up and it will take a while to navigate all outstanding checks, but we will work them as quickly as we safely and accurately can.' However, the shutdown has raised concerns about the state's IT security and the potential for data breaches. Retailer Dan Mitchell said, 'The state has set another example of how vulnerable and weak their computer databases are.' The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) is considering all options to ensure law-abiding Washingtonians can exercise their Second Amendment rights. Gun owners are calling for changes to the law to allow emergency access to the FBI National Instant Check System (NICS) or to switch to the NICS system entirely.

**WA resumes firearm background checks after security concerns cause 2-week delay**
Washington State Patrol (WSP) has resumed background checks for firearm sales after a two-week delay caused by security concerns. The restoration of the online resources necessary for the checks comes after WSP was threatened with a lawsuit from the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) over the agency's inability to perform background checks. WSP personnel completed over 6,500 backlogged checks within the first eight hours of service being restored, and the agency receives an average of 700 background check requests each business day. According to WSP, 'During the system outage, WSP continued to do the non-AOC related work so that once data services were regained the delayed background checks could be completed quickly.'

**Washington Firearm Background Checks Back Online After SAFE System Hack**
The Secure Automated Firearms E-Check SAFE system in Washington, which handles firearm background checks, was restored on Sunday after a weeks-long pause caused by a cyberattack. The system had been down since November 2, resulting in a backlog of about 700 daily background check requests that couldn't be processed. Melissa Denny, owner of Pistol Annie's Jewelry and Pawn, noted the strain on businesses during the outage, saying, 'We take the brunt of the frustration from customers who don’t understand the delays.' Officials warned that processing delays will continue as they catch up, but assured the public they are prioritizing safety and efficiency. The restoration of the system is a relief for buyers and sellers, though frustrations persist as the backlog is cleared, with officials expecting it to take at least another week to resolve all delays.

**Firearm Suppressor Demand Explodes At Historic Rate**
According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) data, Americans are purchasing firearm suppressors at a historic rate. The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) reported that American gun owners are on track to exceed 87 years of registered silencers in just the latest three years. The ATF is now processing suppressor applications in record time, with some instances being processed the same day. As a result, silencer registration metrics are off the chart, with over 4.86 million silencers in possession by law-abiding Americans. This surge in suppressor demand is likely good news for SilencerCo, one of the largest firearm suppressor companies in the US. However, the overall firearms industry has been experiencing hard times since the gun bubble popped in 2021. Despite this, NICS checks are still well above a 20-year trend and seasonally rising into the end of the year.

**Thousands of gun sales on hold in Washington state amid weeks-long...**
Thousands of gun sales in Washington state are on hold due to a court computer system outage that has prevented background checks from being completed. Second Amendment advocates are threatening to sue, calling the situation 'tyranny' and a 'mass deprivation of civil rights.' The Washington State Patrol typically processes 400-1,000 background checks per day, but has been unable to do so since November 1. Officials hope to have the system back online next week, but a growing backlog could slow things down. Gun dealers are frustrated, with one store owner saying, 'The government just shuts down and says, 'You're on our time now.' But the government works for us. We don't work for them.'

**Local Media Ignores Major Issue With Washington State Background Check System**
The Washington State background check system has been suspended for 10 days due to a 'network infiltration' at the Administrative Office of the Courts. The Second Amendment Foundation is threatening to sue the Washington State Patrol, saying that the suspension has denied citizens their right to obtain firearms. SAF founder Alan Gottlieb stated, 'Washington State citizens have had their rights under the federal and state constitutions suspended, and we will take legal action if this isn’t solved immediately.' The group claims that state law prevents the use of the federal NICS system as a replacement, leaving residents and retailers unable to complete transactions. Gottlieb noted, 'A right delayed is a right denied,' and that the state has denied untold numbers of citizens their right to obtain firearms for almost two weeks. Local media has largely ignored the issue, with only brief mentions in a few outlets.

**Young Texas man accused of planning mass shooting at Buc-ee’s**
Cameron Darrick Peterson, 20, of New Braunfels, Texas, has pleaded guilty to attempting to receive a firearm to use to commit a felony. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Peterson began planning mass shootings in November 2022, including at a Buc-ee's on I-35 in New Braunfels. He was denied the purchase of a 12-gauge shotgun in January 2024 due to his age and the type of firearm. Peterson was later added to the National Instant Background Check System (NICS) prohibited person list after admitting to daily marijuana use. He was arrested on June 5 and charged with one count of attempt to receive a firearm to use to commit a felony. FBI agents seized an altered .22 caliber long rifle, six magazines loaded with 60 rounds, and materials to manufacture destructive devices from his home. Peterson faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, and is set to be sentenced on February 5, 2025.

**Are October Gun Sales a Bellwether for the 2024 Election?**
According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, there were 1,302,857 background checks conducted on firearm transfers in October 2024, a 5% decrease from the same month in 2023 but an increase of 200,000 from September 2024. Mark Oliva, NSSF's managing director for public affairs, says this is a sign that lawful gun ownership continues to be an important factor in the elections. He notes that October marks the 63rd straight month of over 1 million background checks. The figures suggest that Americans are 'voting with their wallets' and investing in their rights, with law-abiding citizens purchasing firearms in anticipation of potential gun restrictions. While the growth in sales checks was modest, October 2024 was the fifth-best October on record, and the trend is similar to that of the 2016 presidential election year.

**Democrats Make Clear They Will Come for Guns**
Democrats have made it clear that they will pursue gun control measures, including confiscating 'assault weapons' such as the AR-15. According to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the ban is necessary to reduce crime. However, statistics from the Department of Justice's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) show that the previous 'assault weapons' ban from 1994 to 2004 did not lead to a reduction in crime. With an estimated 500 million civilian-owned firearms in the United States, the Harris/Walz regime will face a significant challenge in implementing their gun control measures. Harris has already stated that she will 'hit the ground running' to implement these measures, which could lead to a surge in gun sales and potentially the eventual ban on all firearms. As Ammo.com statistics show, there has been a significant increase in gun purchases between 2020 and 2023, with over 1 million NICS background checks for purchases each month for 57 consecutive months.

**How Many Guns In The US: All About America’s Firearms In 2024**
According to estimates, there are between 400 million and 500 million civilian-owned firearms in the United States. This translates to approximately 1.5 firearms per person and 1.93 firearms per adult. The largest surge in gun purchases occurred between 2020 and 2023, with over 1 million NICS background checks for purchases each month for 57 consecutive months. Additionally, 46% of American households, approximately 65.19 million, contain at least one firearm. The number of concealed carry permits has also increased, with 22 million Americans holding a permit as of 2023. However, the exact number of firearms in the U.S. is difficult to determine due to factors such as unregistered guns, private sales, and reporting constraints.

**NICS background check rate in the U.S., by state 2023**
The National Instant Background Check System (NICS) is used by Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. The system checks for a criminal record or ineligibility to purchase. According to Statista, the NICS background check rate in the U.S. varies by state, but this number does not represent the number of firearms sold in the U.S. due to varying state laws and purchase scenarios. Population data is based on the Census 2022 Population Estimates.

**The flood of ghost guns is slowing after regulation. It's also being challenged in the Supreme Court**
A Biden administration rule passed in 2022 blocks teenagers and people who can't pass a background check from buying gun kits, also known as ghost guns. However, manufacturers and gun-rights groups have pushed back in court, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the regulation will stand. Since the regulation went into effect, several cities report the number of privately made firearms recovered at crime scenes has flattened or declined. Guy Boyd, who was accidentally shot in the head with a ghost gun in 2021, said, 'I was in good health before, playing football, didn't have any medical problems, and now it's one thing after another.' The number of ghost guns around the country has soared in recent years, going from fewer than 4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 recovered at crime scenes in 2021. Industry and gun rights groups say the ATF overreached by targeting a product that had long been legal. 'No matter how wise ATF's final rule or how 'weighty' petitioners' policy concerns may be, the final rule exceeds ATF's statutory authority,' said the states in a brief authored by the West Virginia Attorney General's Office.

**FBI Report Shows Dramatic Violent Crime Drop as 29 States Went Permitless**
The FBI's 2023 national crime report shows a record-breaking decline in murders, with a 11.6% drop, and a 3.0% decrease in national violent crime. This comes as 29 states have adopted 'constitutional carry' laws, allowing citizens to carry firearms without a permit. According to the Brennan Center, the data aligns with predictions from independent experts, who estimated steep drops in murders in 2023 and 2024. The report also notes that the number of active carry permits and licenses declined slightly last year, and that the estimated number of law-abiding citizens carrying defensive sidearms under the 'constitutional carry' laws is unknown. The FBI report highlights the decline in violent crime, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter decreasing by 11.6%, rape by 9.4%, and aggravated assault by 2.8%. However, the report remains user-unfriendly, making it difficult to determine the types of firearms used in homicides. As noted by the FBI, more than 16,000 agencies submitted data to the UCR Program through the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and the Summary Reporting System, covering a combined population of 94.3% inhabitants.

**Justice Department's Gun Violence Prevention Plan Widens Background Checks, Boosts Red Flag Programs**
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced plans to help combat gun violence and save lives. The DOJ developed resources to help small and rural law enforcement agencies deal with mass shootings and plug gaps in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022 requires a check of the criminal and mental health history of gun purchasers under 21, but many states and territories restrict the sharing of this information. The DOJ also announced a plan to issue $85 million in grants for community violence intervention and prevention initiatives and over $135 million for red flag programs. However, a firearms industry spokesman expressed some concern over the red flag grants, stating that due process rights must be preserved under the law. 'The Department of Justice is committed to doing everything in its power to combat gun violence and save lives,' Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said. 'Today's actions are a continuation of our efforts to fully implement the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.'

**Justice Department announces new model legislation on including juvenile records in firearm background checks**
The Justice Department has announced new model legislation to improve firearm background checks and reduce gun violence. The legislation would allow states to share juvenile criminal history and mental health records with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), while maintaining the confidentiality of juveniles. According to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022, NICS must contact state and local law enforcement to determine if a purchaser under 21 is prohibited from buying a firearm. However, some states restrict the sharing of juvenile records. The model legislation creates an exception to these restrictions, allowing law enforcement to access these records during background checks. As Attorney General Merrick Garland said, 'This model legislation will help states ensure that juvenile records are used to prevent gun violence, while protecting the confidentiality of juveniles.'

**White House: Background checks blocked gun sales to youth, domestic abusers**
The White House reported that enhanced background checks have blocked thousands of gun sales to people under 21 and those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes in the past year. According to the White House, homicides have dropped 17% in the period, and mass shootings are down 20% compared to a year earlier. The FBI has conducted over 300,000 enhanced background checks, denying more than 3,500 transactions, with the enhanced background checks alone responsible for nearly 900 blocked sales. Stefanie Feldman, who heads the new office, said the progress reflected a wide range of efforts, including executive actions, increased collaboration among federal agencies, and increased funding for enforcement of existing laws and mental health programs. She also stated that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will announce additional executive action soon, involving 'wholly new ideas'.

**Improved Background Checks Block Thousands of Gun Sales to Minors and Domestic Violence Offenders**
The White House said on Sunday that improved background checks have blocked the sale of thousands of guns to people under 21 and domestic violence offenders in the past year. According to the White House, homicides fell 17% in the period, following the largest decline in homicides in 2023. The Gun Violence Archive data showed that mass shootings also fell 20% in 2024 compared to the previous year and are expected to reach their lowest level since 2019. The FBI conducted over 300,000 improved background checks on individuals under 21, following the bipartisan law that restricts gun purchases, signed in June 2022. The legislation has already blocked over 3,500 transactions, with nearly 900 blocked sales attributed to improved background checks alone, the White House said. Background checks for domestic violence offenders have blocked over 4,600 sales so far this year. Stefanie Feldman, who leads the task force, said that the progress reflects a wide range of efforts, including dozens of executive actions since Biden took office, increased collaboration between federal agencies, closer work with state and local governments, and increased funding for enforcing existing laws and mental health programs. She told Reuters that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, will announce new executive actions soon. 'The progress we've made is a testament to the power of collaboration and the importance of taking action to prevent gun violence,' Feldman said.

The White House announced that enhanced background checks have blocked thousands of gun sales to people under 21 and those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes in the past year. According to the White House, homicides have dropped 17% in the period, and mass shootings have decreased by 20% compared to last year. The FBI has conducted over 300,000 enhanced background checks, denying more than 3,500 transactions, with nearly 900 blocked sales attributed to the enhanced background checks alone. Stefanie Feldman, head of the new office established by President Joe Biden to prevent gun violence, stated that the progress reflects a wide range of efforts, including executive actions, increased collaboration among federal agencies, and closer work with state and local governments. Feldman also mentioned that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will announce additional executive action soon, involving 'wholly new ideas'.

Stefanie Feldman, head of the new office, said the progress reflects a wide range of efforts, including executive actions, collaboration among federal agencies, and increased funding for enforcement of existing laws and mental health programs. She stated, 'The further away you get from Washington, the less political this issue actually is.' Everyone wants their kid to come home from school safely and be able to play in the neighborhood safely, she added. The office is working with Republican state and local officials, and 17 states have passed legislation to address gun violence.
