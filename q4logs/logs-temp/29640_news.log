**Silent Layoffs Surge in Silicon Valley As Tech Giants Aim To Avoid Bad Press, Adopt Techniques Like 'Work From Office' To Trigger Job Cuts: Report**
Silent or stealth layoffs have become a common practice among tech companies in Silicon Valley to avoid bad press and reduce employee headcounts. According to Layoffs.Fyi, 457 tech companies have laid off 139,534 employees since the start of 2024. Companies like Microsoft, Google, Northvolt, Apple, IBM, Intel, Dell, and Luminar have implemented silent layoffs. The report highlights that companies use techniques like 'Work From Office' mandates to trigger job cuts without making official announcements. For example, Amazon's 5-day return-to-office mandate has led to nearly 1,900 employees looking for job changes. Google's 2023 layoffs, announced through a 2 AM email, became a PR nightmare and attracted negative press. The report notes that silently laying off employees does not affect the remaining staff and is a way for companies to avoid making headlines.

**Tech Layoffs Continue in 2024: Over 139,000 Job Cuts in 451 Companies**
The tech sector is experiencing a significant wave of layoffs in 2024, with over 139,206 job cuts in 451 tech companies, according to the independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. Companies such as Tesla, Amazon, Google, TikTok, Snap, and Microsoft have made significant layoffs in the first months of 2024. Even smaller startups have seen a considerable number of layoffs, and in some cases, have shut down operations entirely. The reason for the layoffs is the focus on artificial intelligence, which is accompanied by an increasing attention to costs. The layoffs in 2024 are targeted at sectors that are less profitable. According to McKinsey, by 2030, at least 14% of workers may need to change jobs due to digitalization, robotics, and artificial intelligence. The first companies that can afford to take this path are those that control, to a large extent, the development of the technologies they themselves must use. This is the necessary choice that guides the organizational restructuring that will lead to an increase in employees in more innovative areas and a reduction in employment in less profitable areas.

**Massive layoffs in tech industry: Over 100000 jobs eliminated at firms including Microsoft, IBM**
The tech industry has seen a surge in layoffs, with companies like IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, and Dell implementing job cuts as part of their restructuring efforts. IBM's recent layoffs target senior programmers, sales staff, and support personnel, aiming to reduce a small percentage of its global workforce.

Microsoft has also made layoffs, cutting 650 employees from its Xbox division, but reassured the public that no games or studio closures would result from the cuts. In contrast, the IT services sector is projected to see a significant rebound in fresh hiring during the fiscal year 2025, with entry-level hires expected to nearly double, reaching over 150,000 new positions. According to Aditya Narayan Mishra, MD & CEO of CIEL HR, fresher hiring demand is expected to rise by 10-15% in the second half of FY25 compared to the same period last year.

**Microsoft's Layoffs Follow a Pattern of Post-Acquisition Restructuring**
Microsoft has announced the layoff of 650 employees in its Xbox division, following a pattern of layoffs after acquisitions. This brings the total number of layoffs in the gaming division to 1900, including those from Activision Blizzard. The CEO of Microsoft Gaming, Phil Spencer, stated that the decision was made to align the team structure post-acquisition and reorganize the activity for long-term success. This strategy is not unique to Microsoft, as seen in the case of Wetransfer, which was acquired by Bending Spoons and is now undergoing a 75% reduction in staff. The goal is to make the acquired companies more competitive in the market. According to the website layoffs.fyi, which tracks layoffs in the tech industry, 136,360 workers have been laid off from 435 companies in 2024, with Apple and IBM also among the top companies with the most layoffs. This is a continuation of the trend seen in 2023, where 264,220 workers were laid off from 1,193 companies.

**Tech Sector Layoffs 'Rival Worst Spikes' Over Time**
Analysts at RBC Capital Markets are warning investors about the recent surge in tech layoffs, which they say 'rivals some of the worst spikes this industry has seen over time.' According to RBC, the number of layoffs in the tech sector has remained below historical highs, but the current spike is a cause for concern. The analysts argue that the trend of payroll numbers dropping below expectations is a sign of normalization, but the tech layoffs are seen as a red flag. The decisions could have ripple effects outside of the tech sector and impact other shifts in the market. As of September 9, more than 212,000 people have been impacted by layoffs in 2024, with major vendors like Intel, Dell, and Microsoft cutting thousands of jobs. Smaller companies in the channel have also followed this trend, with Five9 cutting 180 jobs in late August. 'What caught our attention was the spike in layoffs for technology companies which wasn't as bad as those seen in late 2022 and early 2023, but otherwise rivals some of the worst spikes this industry has seen over time,' RBC's analysts wrote.
