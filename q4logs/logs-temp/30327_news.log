**Walton Family Surpasses $300 Billion in Net Worth, Becoming Richest Family in the World**
The Walton family, owners of the retail giant Walmart, has surpassed $300 billion in net worth, making them the richest family in the world in 2024, according to a recent report. The family's wealth is built on the success of Walmart, which was founded by Sam Walton in 1962 and has since become the largest retailer in the world, operating over 11,000 stores in 27 countries and employing over 2 million people. The key to Walmart's success lies in its business model, centered on offering low prices and a wide variety of products, a strategy that has allowed it to expand globally and dominate the retail market. Alice Walton, Sam Walton's only daughter, is the richest woman in the world, with a net worth of $95 billion in 2024, surpassing Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, heiress to L'Oréal. Alice is a recognized philanthropist and passionate art collector, and has founded the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, which showcases iconic works by artists such as Georgia O'Keeffe and Andy Warhol.

**Meet man, who earns more than Elon Musk but still not in world’s top 10 richest persons list, reason is...**
Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has solidified his position as the world's richest person, with a net worth of $314 billion. However, he is not the highest earner of 2024, with Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, surpassing him with a net worth increase of $84.8 billion. Despite this, Huang's total wealth is $129 billion, ranking him 11th on the global rich list. Other notable earners include Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Ellison, while Bernard Arnault experienced the steepest decline, losing $35.3 billion this year. Musk's dominance in wealth remains unmatched, but Huang's rise highlights the growing influence of technology-driven fortunes in the global economy.

**Why Walmart stock keeps hitting new highs, making the Waltons richer than ever**
Walmart's stock has surged to record highs, making the Walton family richer than ever. The company's strategy of selling everyday products at low prices has fueled the stellar run, and experts say it's not surprising to see the Waltons reap the rewards. The siblings, Jim, Rob, and Alice, rank among the world's 20 wealthiest people and have net worths in excess of $100 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. David King, a management professor at Florida State University, attributed Walmart's success to its value for money, ubiquity, and national logistics network. Art Weinstein, a marketing professor at Nova Southeastern University, credited Sam Walton's philosophy of centering the customer and the company's low prices, one-stop shopping experience, and supply chain expertise. The Waltons have retained more of the company over the years because Walmart has largely self-financed its scaling, unlike many tech companies.

**Forbes List Debunks the Myth of the Rich and the Poor**
The Forbes list reveals that the mantra of the left about the rich and the poor is incorrect. The list shows that 7 out of the 10 richest people in 2014 are no longer in the top 10 in 2024. This demonstrates that wealth is not static and that the rich are not always the same. Christy Walton, for example, lost 67% of her fortune and fell from the 9th position in 2014 to the 140th position in 2024. On the other hand, Elon Musk rose from the 158th position in 2014 to the 2nd position in 2024, with a fortune of nearly $200 billion. This shows that wealth depends on how well one satisfies the needs and desires of society, and that it is not just about having a lot of money.

**Rob Walton Joins the Exclusive Club of Billionaires with a Net Worth of Over $100 Billion**
Rob Walton, the eldest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton, has joined the exclusive club of billionaires with a net worth of over $100 billion for the first time, thanks to the historic high of Walmart's stock. His estimated net worth of $100 billion makes him the first member of the Walton family to reach a 12-digit fortune. The 54% increase in Walmart's stock this year has led to a surge in demand for the retailer's 'everyday low prices', allowing people to escape high inflation. As a result, Rob Walton, 79, has become the 16th richest person in the world, surpassing his brother Jim Walton, 76, and sister Alice Walton, 74, who have a net worth of $98.8 billion and $91.3 billion, respectively. According to Forbes, three-quarters of the Walton family's shares are divided almost equally between Rob, Jim, and Alice, with the rest belonging to the heirs of their brother John Walton (deceased in 2005), including his widow Christy Walton, 75, and son Lukas Walton, 37, who have a net worth of $17 billion and $35.1 billion, respectively. As Walmart's stock continues to rise, Jim and Alice could soon join their brother in donating to non-profit organizations, joining the exclusive club of billionaires with a net worth of over $100 billion.

The siblings are the children of Walmart founder Sam Walton, who built the world's largest company by revenue, with annual sales of $665 billion, and the largest company in the world by the number of employees, with 2.1 million workers. However, Walmart's market value does not qualify it for the top 10 list, ranking 13th globally with a market capitalization of $648.4 billion. The Walton family controls around half of the company's capital, which was divided equally among Sam's four children - Jim, Rob, John, and Alice - after John's death in 2005. His son Lukas inherited a third of his father's wealth, while his wife Christie inherited 2% of Walmart's shares, making her one of the richest women in the world.

**Alice Walton Regains Title as World's Richest Woman**
Alice Walton, the heiress to Walmart, has regained her title as the world's richest woman, surpassing Françoise Bettencourt Meyers of L'Oréal, according to a recent Forbes report. This is due to a 47% increase in the value of her shares. Walton, 74, has an estimated fortune of $89.1 billion, while Meyers has $88.4 billion. Walton has sold over $22 billion in Walmart shares and donated over $11 billion to charitable causes, but her stake in the company remains significant. Born in 1949, she is the daughter of Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart, and has grown up in an environment where entrepreneurial spirit is part of her family's legacy. This connection to the company is key to understanding her current wealth. Walton's rise marks a new chapter in the competition for the title of world's richest woman, a rivalry that began in 2019. In 2023, Julia Koch, heiress to Koch Industries, temporarily interrupted this rivalry, pushing Walton to third place before she regained her position. Alice is the youngest of four siblings, and although she is expected to continue the family legacy, her interest has focused on art. Her net worth, although impressive, is lower than that of her brothers Jim and Rob Walton, who are also among the richest people in the United States. Jim Walton has a fortune of $102.6 billion, and Rob has $100.4 billion. The Walton family's combined wealth exceeds $350 billion, having grown by around $30 billion in recent years.

Walton's wealth increase has been driven by Walmart's outstanding performance in 2023, with a 47% growth in the value of its shares.
