**Amid bird flu outbreaks, CDC pushes for PPE use on dairy farms**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging dairy farms to use personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect workers from bird flu outbreaks. According to the CDC, workers on dairy farms face a transmission risk when exposed to infected cows or raw milk from acutely infected cows. Researchers from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment found that PPE use increased by 28% after detection of the A(H5N1) virus, with eye protection while milking cows showing the greatest increase (40%). The CDC recommends that workers wear fluid-resistant coveralls, a NIOSH-approved particulate respirator, goggles, and other protective gear. The agency suggests that providing PPE to farms before outbreaks occur could help prevent human cases of A(H5N1). 'Public health agencies should continue to conduct outreach to farms and educate farm owners about the importance of workers using PPE during farm duties and exposure to ill cows,' the CDC says.

**Avian flu confirmed in more US poultry, cattle; more than 500 herds now affected**
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed more H5 avian influenza outbreaks in dairy cows and poultry, bringing the national total to 505 from 15 states. In California, the state's total has risen to 291, with 13 more confirmations in dairy cows. Additionally, two more poultry flocks have been affected, one in Tulare County, California, and another in Malheur County, Oregon. The Oregon Department of Agriculture reported that the affected flock had chickens and ducks, and the birds were humanely euthanized. Alveo Technologies has received an agreement from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop a rapid molecular test to differentiate between influenza A, influenza B, and H5 influenza in people. The portable test can expand diagnostic capacity and deliver accurate, real-time results via a secure cloud-based portal.

**HPAI still spreading in Western livestock HPAI still spreading in Western livestock**
Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) continues to spread in the Western United States, affecting wild and domestic birds, dairy cattle, and swine. The USDA is ramping up testing and monitoring for the virus, with a focus on biosecurity and containment measures. Amber Itle, Washington's state veterinarian, emphasizes the importance of staying alert for sudden illness and deaths in flocks and taking steps in biosecurity. The virus has been devastating farm animals since 2022, with widespread outbreaks in wild birds and recent human cases among U.S. dairy and poultry workers. New detections have been reported in Oregon, Washington, Utah, and California, with 105.2 million poultry affected and 492 dairy herds infected nationwide. Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, notes that farms are taking biosecurity measures, including preventing non-essential visitors, enforcing farm barriers, and requiring personal protective equipment for employees.

**Bulk milk testing for HPAI to begin**
The USDA will begin testing bulk raw milk for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in early November, following Colorado's lead. The testing will start in states where the H5N1 virus has been identified, and then expand to states where it has not been confirmed. If bulk samples test positive, testing will be narrowed down to the farm level to track and monitor the disease. This move comes after the U.S. Animal Health Association and the American Association of Bovine Practitioners emphasized the need for a coordinated state and federal surveillance plan. The virus has slowed its spread since the spring, but new cases have been confirmed in California, Idaho, and Utah. Colorado implemented mandatory weekly milk testing in July and has seen no new cases since August. The nation's largest dairy state, California, has seen 223 confirmed cases of HPAI since August, representing more than half of the country's total confirmed cases.

**USDA to Test Raw Milk for Avian Influenza**
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has launched a monitoring initiative to detect the presence of the H5N1 virus in raw milk at the wholesale level, in response to the increase in cases of avian influenza among farm animals. The goal is to contain the rapid spread of the virus in dairy farms and protect the health of agricultural workers who are in constant contact with infected animals. According to the USDA, the virus has been detected in over 400 farms in various regions of the US, with California being one of the states with the highest incidence, accounting for over 200 cases. The USDA has implemented a multi-step strategy to collect milk samples and evaluate the presence of the virus H5N1 in these productions. The agency explained that the objective of this approach is twofold: to reduce the spread of the virus and to decrease the risk of occupational exposure for those working with infected animals. 'The data collected so far have shown that H5N1 can be transmitted through equipment, people, and other elements that circulate between farms, affecting both dairy farms and poultry facilities,' the agency stated. The detection of the first pig infected with H5N1 in Oregon has raised concerns about the risk of the virus eventually adapting to infect humans. Scientists at the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) have performed genetic sequencing of the virus found in this pig and in the birds of the farm where the outbreak originated. So far, no mutations have been detected that indicate an increase in the virus's ability to transmit to humans. However, this finding has intensified monitoring and control efforts, as the meat and agricultural industries have expressed concern about the economic and public health impact that an expansion of the virus could generate. The USDA's decision to implement large-scale testing of raw milk has been influenced by the agricultural industry's push to strengthen surveillance efforts. A pilot program in Colorado has shown positive results, reducing new cases of avian influenza in dairy cows. The experience in Colorado has been key to expanding this program to other affected areas and promoting control policies in other dairy farms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported that 35 people have been infected with the virus, although no cases related to milk consumption have been confirmed. As for the risks to consumers, health authorities assure that pasteurization of milk eliminates the H5N1 virus, representing an effective measure to ensure the safety of dairy products. However, raw unpasteurized milk remains a concern due to the potential for contamination, not only with avian influenza but also with pathogens such as E. coli and Salmonella. The CDC and USDA strongly recommend that consumers avoid consuming raw milk, especially in these high-risk moments. The USDA's decision to analyze raw milk at the wholesale level marks a significant step in containing avian influenza in the livestock sector, as well as a preventive measure to protect both the industry and consumers. In collaboration with state authorities and agricultural industry actors, the USDA seeks to establish a robust and continuous monitoring network that allows for rapid response to new outbreaks and minimizes the effects of this highly contagious virus. With these actions, authorities aim to reduce the spread of H5N1 in the country and protect both agricultural workers and consumers of dairy products, in a context where food safety has become a growing priority.

**Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza confirmed in Jackson County**
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) confirmed Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in a backyard flock of geese and chickens in Jackson County, Oregon. This is the first confirmed case of HPAI in Jackson County. According to the USDA, HPAI detections are higher in the fall and spring due to wild birds spreading the virus during migration. Since May 2022, 38 backyard flocks and three commercial poultry flocks have been affected in Oregon. Dr. Ryan Scholz, Oregon Department of Agriculture's State Veterinarian, placed the Jackson County farm under quarantine and humanely euthanized all poultry on the property. The USDA stated, 'None of the animals on the farm entered the food supply chain, nor were they intended for the commercial food market.' The CDC recommends choosing pasteurized milk and dairy products to protect health. To prevent the spread of the virus, bird and livestock owners can take biosecurity measures such as preventing exposure to wildlife, limiting co-mingling of different species, and sanitizing equipment.

**USDA improves H5N1 testing and monitoring efforts for dairy cattle**
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is enhancing its testing and monitoring efforts to protect dairy cattle from the H5N1 avian influenza. Following its detection in dairy herds in March 2024, the USDA is collaborating with state veterinarians to implement a tiered strategy for collecting bulk milk samples. This approach has already shown success, reducing the number of states reporting H5N1 from 14 to 2 in the past month. USDA officials emphasize the need for additional measures to enhance biosecurity and protect farm workers from potential exposure. Historically, bulk milk testing has proven effective in controlling livestock diseases, and the USDA plans to extend this approach to other regions and states. Farmers are urged to prioritize biosecurity measures, and the USDA is advancing the development of an H5N1 vaccine for dairy cows, with two candidates currently undergoing field trials.

**Avian flu spreads to Utah dairies as APHIS rolls out new testing**
The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) has confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in eight commercial dairy facilities in Cache County. Mandatory surveillance and animal movement restrictions have been put in place to prevent further spread of the virus. State veterinarian Dr. Daniel Christensen stated, 'At this time we don‚Äôt anticipate any major impacts on the food supply and the overall impacts to individual dairies are relatively minimal.' The UDAF is actively collaborating with dairy producers and partners to implement response plans, surveillance, and testing measures to protect against HPAI spread. The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has confirmed an additional nine H5N1 outbreaks on California dairy farms, bringing the national total to 404. APHIS has introduced a tiered approach to milk sampling to identify H5N1 presence more effectively and support strong biosecurity efforts. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that the recent HPAI cases do not pose an immediate public health threat.

**Utah reports avian flu in diary cows as USDA announces plan for bulk milk sampling**
The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) has confirmed highly pathogenic avian flu at eight commercial dairy farms in the state, with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announcing a plan for bulk milk sampling to prevent further spread of the virus. State veterinarian Daniel Christensen said, 'At this time we don't anticipate any major impacts on the food supply and the overall impacts to individual dairies are relatively minimal.' The USDA has also confirmed 9 more H5N1 outbreaks at California dairy farms, raising the state's total to 202 and the national total to 404. The USDA has announced a tiered strategy to collect milk samples to assess where H5N1 is present and to support effective biosecurity measures. The rollout of testing will begin at the regional level, with additional testing at the farm level, if needed, until all herds are free of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 39 avian flu cases in the US, with all but one involving farm worker exposure to sick poultry or cows.

**Bird Flu Is One Step Closer to Mixing with Seasonal Flu Virus and Becoming a Pandemic**
The H5N1 avian influenza virus has been detected in a pig for the first time in Oregon, raising concerns about the potential for reassortment with seasonal influenza. According to Richard Webby, an infectious disease researcher, reassortment alone cannot create a virus capable of launching a human pandemic, but it could help move the virus from an infected human's eye to their respiratory tract. Webby says that the virus would need to accrue specific mutations to become more transmissible among humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged farm workers to get their seasonal flu shots, and the U.S. has a stockpile of H5N1 vaccines, but it has not yet distributed any. Some scientists have called for vaccinating cattle against H5N1, and the USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics has approved a couple of vaccine field safety trials. 'It's not a bright-line rule,' said the CDC's principal deputy director Nirav Shah. 'It's really a variety of factors that we think about as we evaluate the pros and cons of vaccination.'

**US Confirms Presence of Avian Flu H5N1 in Pigs for First Time**
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) confirmed the presence of avian flu H5N1 in pigs for the first time in the United States, according to the USDA on Wednesday. The USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed on Tuesday that one of the five pigs on a farm in Oregon was infected with the H5N1 virus, marking the first time the virus has been detected in pigs in the US. The farm has been placed under quarantine to prevent further spread of the virus, and other animals on the farm, such as sheep and goats, are being monitored, according to the USDA. The USDA stated that there is no concern about the safety of the nation's pork supply as a result of this finding. Additionally, two on-site safety tests with vaccine candidates have been designed to protect dairy cows from H5N1, the USDA added.

**US Confirms First Case of H5N1 Avian Flu in Pig**
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed the presence of the H5N1 avian flu virus in a pig for the first time. The Oregon Department of Agriculture reported on Friday that the first case of H5N1 had been detected in a pig on a farm in the state. National veterinary services laboratories at the USDA confirmed on Tuesday that one of the five pigs on the farm was infected with the H5N1 virus, marking the first detection of the virus in pigs in the United States. The farm has been quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus. The other animals on the farm, including sheep and goats, are being monitored, according to the USDA. The farm is a non-commercial operation and the animals were not intended for commercial meat production. 'This discovery does not raise any concerns about the safety of the country's pork supply,' the USDA said in a statement. Two field trials have been approved for candidate vaccines to protect dairy cows against the H5N1 virus, it added.

**USDA to Expand Avian Flu Testing in Raw Milk**
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) will begin testing raw milk for avian flu in bulk across the country, a significant expansion of the agency's efforts to contain the rapid spread of the virus, said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. The move comes after farmers and veterinarians pressured the USDA to strengthen its current surveillance approach, which they deemed inadequate to contain the virus, according to state records and industry documents. Starting in early November, the agency will begin taking samples of milk in states where dairy cattle have contracted avian flu, including tests in specific farms as needed to track the spread of the virus, Vilsack said in an interview. Additionally, the USDA will begin testing in states that have not identified the virus in dairy cows. The rapid spread of the virus in California, where nearly 200 dairy herds have tested positive since late August, contributed to the USDA's decision that more surveillance efforts are needed, Vilsack said. 'These situations evolve over time and, as they evolve, it is necessary to recalibrate and adjust,' Vilsack added. The effort comes on top of an emergency order issued in April that requires testing of cattle moving across state borders, and a USDA program that covers the costs of voluntary testing for farmers. It was previously reported that the USDA had relaxed those rules after opposition from state officials and industry representatives. Avian flu has infected nearly 400 dairy herds in 14 states and at least 36 people, according to data and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Virologists and federal health officials are also concerned about the convergence of avian flu and seasonal flu that could allow the avian flu virus to mutate if people become co-infected, making it more easily transmissible between humans. Some dairy farmers in states have resisted voluntary testing of their animals due to fear of economic repercussions. More context: State and industry contributions allow EU to reduce avian flu testing in livestock 'We cannot wait for a virus to die out. That strategy has not worked,' said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, which has been involved in discussions about the new recommendations. The American Association of Bovine Practitioners (AABP) also drafted in September recommendations on how the USDA could better contain the virus, with weekly tests of milk tankers, among other strategies, according to emails and a copy of the draft obtained from the Missouri Department of Agriculture in a public records request. 'The disease is still spreading and the current voluntary surveillance is inadequate,' wrote the AABP's executive director, K. Fred Gingrich II, in a group email on September 28. He noted that only 50 of the country's 27,000 dairy herds were enrolled in the USDA's voluntary herd testing program at the time, and that 17.6 million commercial poultry had been slaughtered after the herds tested positive for the bovine variant of avian flu, suggesting that dairy farms are fueling the spread of the virus. Now there are 64 farms enrolled in the program, according to USDA data. The document was sent on September 30 by the Missouri state veterinarian to other animal health officials in the state and to a USDA official in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which is managing the agency's response to avian flu, according to the emails. The recommendations from the group of bovine practitioners came after they participated in a September meeting of the American Veterinary Medical Association along with representatives from the poultry, livestock, and pork industries, according to the emails.

**USDA to Test Raw Milk Across Country to Detect Avian Influenza**
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) will soon begin testing raw milk across the country to detect avian influenza. This decision comes after pressure from the livestock and veterinary industries, which have pushed the agency to strengthen its current surveillance approach, deemed inadequate to contain the virus, according to state records and industry documents examined by Reuters. USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack stated, 'These situations evolve over time, and as they evolve, we need to recalibrate and adjust.' The agency will start by collecting samples from states where dairy cows have contracted the virus, including specific farms if necessary to track the virus's spread. The USDA will then conduct tests in states that have not identified the virus in dairy cows. The rapid spread of the virus in California, where nearly 200 dairy herds have tested positive since late August, contributed to the USDA's decision to continue surveillance efforts, Vilsack said. The USDA had previously stated that it was possible to eliminate avian influenza from the US dairy herd using its previous approach. However, the agency now wants to eradicate the virus, Vilsack added, citing the success of Colorado's use of milk testing to eliminate new cases of infected dairy cows. In some states, dairy producers have opposed voluntary testing of their animals due to fear of economic repercussions. The American Association of Animal Health has adopted a resolution emphasizing the need for a coordinated national surveillance plan between states and the federal government, according to a copy of the document obtained by Reuters. 'The strict requirement for a pre-test of only lactating dairy cows moving from one state to another is inadequate,' the document reads, recommending that the agency coordinate with the livestock and state sectors in a national surveillance and data collection strategy. 'We can't wait for a virus to die out. This strategy hasn't worked,' said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, who participated in discussions on the new recommendations. The American Association of Bovine Practitioners has also written recommendations on how the USDA could better contain the virus, including conducting weekly tests on tanker trucks, according to emails and a copy of the project obtained from the Missouri Department of Agriculture in response to a public records request. 'The disease continues to spread, and the current voluntary surveillance is inadequate,' wrote the AABP executive director, K. Fred Gingrich II, in a September 28 email to a group server. He noted that only 50 of the 27,000 US dairy herds were then enrolled in the USDA's voluntary testing program and that 17.6 million commercial poultry had been slaughtered after the herds had tested positive for the avian influenza variant, suggesting that dairy farms are fueling the spread of the virus. According to USDA data, 64 farms are currently enrolled in the voluntary testing program.

**USDA Builds on Actions to Protect Livestock and Public Health From H5N1 Avian Influenza**
USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will enhance national surveillance of H5N1 on dairy farms by implementing a tiered strategy to collect milk samples. This move aims to better assess where H5N1 is present on U.S. dairy farms and inform biosecurity and containment measures. Since the disease was first detected in dairy cattle in March 2024, the USDA and state and federal partners have taken several steps to understand and eliminate the virus. The number of states with known avian influenza detections in dairy herds has dropped from 14 to two, including California and Idaho. USDA believes that additional steps are needed to remain proactively in support of effective biosecurity measures. The agency has precedent with successful bulk milk testing approaches and plans to work with regions and states to expand bulk milk testing. USDA continues to emphasize that biosecurity is the best weapon against the spread of H5N1 and encourages farmers to practice good biosecurity even if the virus has not been detected in their state or vicinity. The agency also supports the rapid development and timely approval of an H5N1 vaccine for dairy cows. USDA has consistently operated on a science-based, step-by-step approach informed by what it learns about this virus through its everyday work, research, and surveillance efforts.

**As avian flu cases climb, California agencies and industry move to respond**
California is experiencing a fall wave of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) among dairy and poultry operations. As of Tuesday, 186 dairy herds have been infected, the most of any state, according to the USDA. Steve Lyle, director of public affairs for the California Department of Food and Agriculture, said CDFA is testing herds via bulk tank samples, but an exact number of infected cows is not available. Lyle added that the response is evolving as fresh information is confirmed, and one dairy facility has been cleared since the first outbreak. CDFA is 'monitoring closely' to see if infection can jump from cattle back to birds, but there's no current evidence of that happening. Steven Fenaroli, a policy advocate with the California Farm Bureau, praised the government response, saying CDFA and USDA have done a great job in coming up with contingency plans and pulling stakeholders together. However, Western United Dairies CEO Anja Raudabaugh expressed concern for the financial losses facing Central Valley farmers, saying it has been hard on the farmers who are placed under quarantine, and financial relief for those dairies who have had a lot of mortality and milk production losses is not compensable. Despite early October's heat wave, which Raudabaugh said was a setback for cows in recovery, she said the current cool down in temperatures across the state is already making a difference. USDA sent five staff members to support CDFA traceback and epidemiological investigations and nine case managers to complete questionnaires and follow up on contact traces. CDFA confirmed 16 human cases Monday; all the people had contact with infected farm animals and are experiencing only mild symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah said Quest Diagnostics was awarded a CDC contract for an HPAI test that will soon be available with a clinical prescription.

**From poultry to public health: Understanding the H5N1 threat**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is monitoring the spread of avian influenza (H5N1) in the United States, particularly among poultry and dairy workers. As of October 9, 2024, 18 human cases of H5N1 have been reported in the US since 2022. The CDC has allocated over 100,000 doses of seasonal flu vaccine for farm workers in 12 states with positive H5 cases to mitigate the risk of spread. The agency is also testing existing candidate vaccines for effectiveness against current H5N1 strains. Meghan Davis, DVM, PhD, MPH, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, emphasized the importance of the One Health approach in addressing zoonotic diseases like H5N1. The CDC is working with public health laboratories to monitor influenza virus testing and flu surveillance data using CDC's enhanced nationwide summer surveillance strategy. The agency is also providing safety measures for veterinary professionals and clients, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and biosecurity protocols. According to Kemba Marshall, MPH, DVM, DABVP (Avian), SHRM-CP, founder of Marshall Recruiting Consortium, 'Biosecurity also means we should be able to have a record and a log of every person that came to the fair, animal exhibition, or farm.' The CDC recommends that feline owners who have interacted with animals or birds with unknown health status change their clothes and shoes before interacting with personal pets. The agency is also warning against consuming unpasteurized milk due to the H5N1 bird flu virus found in more than 140 US dairy herds and high levels in raw milk.

**HPAI in cattle: What‚Äôs next?**
Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has spread to dairy cattle in the US, posing new challenges. According to Dr. Erica Spackman, HPAI outbreaks are now global and affecting species not traditionally associated with HPAI, such as dairy cows. The virus has caused significant losses in the US poultry industry since 2022 and is still ongoing. Dr. Juan Pi√±eiro noted that the outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in dairy cattle started in the Texas panhandle in February 2023 and has now spread to 14 states, affecting over 319 dairy herds. The disease was initially misdiagnosed but later confirmed as HPAI H5N1 clade B3.13. Precision dairy technologies like wearable collars alerted producers that something was wrong. The FDA and USDA provided evidence that commercial milk supplies remain safe due to pasteurization and separation of sick cows from the milk supply. Dr. Pi√±eiro emphasized the importance of improving timely communication and collaborative efforts from different agencies to stop the spread of this or other emerging diseases. Dr. Kay Russo highlighted the need for development of vaccines for dairy cattle to address HPAI. Dr. Michelle Kromm noted that HPAI virus clade B3.13 presents unique challenges for all animal agriculture, including the need for a consistent national strategy, better science generation, and the exploration of vaccine programs to break transmission cycles.

**USDA Relaxes Avian Flu Testing Order for Dairy Cows Amid Industry Pressure**
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has relaxed its emergency order on testing for avian flu in dairy cows, following pressure from state and industry representatives. The order, published in April after cases of avian flu were detected in eight states, required dairy cows moving between states to have a negative test result within seven days of travel. The USDA had initially considered stricter requirements, including a three-day testing window, but responded to industry concerns before publishing the order. Two veterinarians and a dairy industry representative told Reuters that the relaxation of the order may have contributed to the spread of the virus. They cited logistical constraints in testing animals within a shorter timeframe. Since the order was issued, the outbreak has spread to over 330 herds in 14 states and to 17 human cases among dairy workers. 'All changes or clarifications to the federal order have been made to protect animal and public health by following best scientific practices, using the best available data, and ensuring an appropriate balance between compliance and feasibility for producers,' said a USDA spokesperson in an email. The agency has conducted over 16,000 tests before movement and is supporting an investigation in California to determine if inappropriate animal movements introduced the virus into the state. Rosemary Sifford, USDA chief veterinarian, met with the Livestock Marketing Association to discuss the proposed federal order on April 24, according to a memo sent by the industry group to USDA officials and obtained through a public records request. 'The 72-hour window before movement is simply not achievable,' wrote Chelsea Good, LMA vice president of government and industry affairs, suggesting instead a testing window of 7-14 days. The USDA did not set a testing deadline in the initial order or in supplementary information published on April 25. A guidance document published on April 26 gave dairy plants a seven-day window for testing. In an ideal world, tests should be conducted within 24 hours, said Keith Poulsen, veterinarian and director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. The rural nature of dairy farms makes it difficult to transport samples to a laboratory, he added. During the same week in April, state animal health officials told the USDA that it should allow states to agree on alternative documentation instead of a veterinarian's health certificate for non-lactating dairy cows crossing state borders to go to slaughter. Non-lactating dairy cows are often converted to ground beef. In the April 26 guidance document, the USDA stated that states would be able to accept alternative documents, which may include basic information such as owner and shipper addresses. According to Bob Seiler, president of the Central Equity Milk Cooperative in Kansas, requiring veterinary documents is too costly for dairy plants with thin margins. He said he was not asked to provide alternative documents when sending non-lactating cows to slaughter. According to Gail Hansen, former Kansas state veterinarian, avoiding the requirement for a veterinarian's approval may have contributed to the spread of the virus. 'The risk of something slipping through the cracks is much greater,' she said. A shortage of rural veterinarians may prevent farmers from having their herds inspected before each shipment, said Poulsen. The USDA spokesperson said that non-slaughter cows are considered to pose a lower risk of avian flu transmission and that other documents allow for traceability in case of infection. California is investigating how the virus entered the state, including whether imports of cows met legal requirements. Since the end of August, over 130 herds and 13 dairy workers have been infected in the state, where dairy production is the largest. Even before the federal order, the agricultural sector relied on state officials to push back against calls to restrict animal movement, according to documents obtained by Reuters. In an email dated March 26, Kansas Farm Bureau CEO Terry Holdren asked Kansas Secretary of Agriculture Mike Beam and Justin Smith, the state's animal health official, if they could pressure Nebraska to continue accepting cattle, after hearing that Nebraska might refuse cattle. On April 1, Nebraska began requiring a permit for lactating dairy cows coming from other states. In some cases, farmers have avoided submitting their cows for testing. 'Dairy producers have no interest in declaring and testing their cows,' said Rick Naerebout, executive director of the Idaho Dairymen's Association.

**Inside the Bungled Bird Flu Response, Where Profits Collide With Public Health**
The US federal government's response to the growing H5N1 bird flu outbreak in dairy cows has been criticized for prioritizing profits over public health. Rural veterinarians who speak out against the government's handling of the outbreak have been silenced or fired. As one White House health official notes, 'Not only have we not learned, we have regressed.' Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, warns that the country is repeating the mistakes of the last pandemic due to a lack of nationwide surveillance and a clear understanding of the outbreak's scope. A company called Medgene has developed an H5N1 vaccine for cows, but has struggled to get approval from the USDA due to trade restrictions.

**Michigan reports avian flu in another dairy herd**
The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) has announced another avian flu outbreak in dairy cattle, its first since early September. The outbreak occurred at a farm in Clinton County, near Lansing, and testing at the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory initially identified the virus. If confirmed as H5N1, the detection would push the number of US outbreaks in dairy cattle to 306 from 14 states. Additionally, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has confirmed three more H5N1 detections in bottlenose dolphins, which were sampled last December and January. According to the USDA, the clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus is known to infect sea mammals, including seals and sea lions, among several other mammal species.

**It starts with a plan**
The recent outbreaks of avian influenza virus Type A (H5N1) in dairy herds have highlighted the importance of biosecurity measures for livestock producers. According to Linda Tikofsky, senior associate director of cattle professional services at Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, 'Avian influenza came from waterfowl, and the National Veterinary Laboratory established that it was one incident, a crossover, that brought the disease into the Texas Panhandle.' However, subsequent outbreaks have been caused by cattle moving between premises, and peridomestic birds such as starlings and pigeons may also act as a transmission source. Tikofsky emphasizes the need for a biosecurity plan, which should include sanitizing trailers between loads, monitoring interactions with people who may have moved from farm to farm, and implementing hygiene practices. She also stresses the importance of working with a veterinarian to develop a plan, which should evaluate how animals are transported, who visits the farm, and how visitors are handled. Tikofsky notes that while there are no vaccines currently available for avian influenza, a robust vaccine program can help stop a disease if it gets introduced. She also recommends including disaster preparedness in the biosecurity plan, such as having a dedicated space separate from the home herd for animals that need to be moved during a disaster.

**US Avian Influenza Outbreak: A Growing Concern for Human Transmission**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States confirmed a new human case of avian influenza A(H5) on September 6, 2024, in Missouri. The patient, who was hospitalized, had underlying medical conditions, was treated with antiviral medications for influenza, and was later discharged and recovered. This case is unique as it is the first without known exposure to infected animals. Unlike previous human cases, which were linked to animal exposure, this case did not have any immediate exposure to animals. The CDC continues to monitor the situation closely, stating that there is no evidence of ongoing transmission among close contacts or otherwise. The risk to the general public from the H5N1 virus remains low, according to the CDC. The USDA reported the first detection of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in dairy cattle and unpasteurized milk samples from Texas and Kansas on March 25. Since then, 255 dairy farms have been affected, along with over 100 million poultry and around 10,000 wild birds. Ra√∫l Rivas Gonz√°lez, a microbiology professor, wrote that the current outbreak has raised concerns about the increased risk of sustained transmission among humans. Gonz√°lez stated that the analysis of data from the sequences of infected cow viruses suggests a single event of transmission from an infected bird to a single dairy cow. The event is estimated to have occurred at the end of 2023 or early 2024. 'The data suggests that H5N1 has adapted perfectly to a new host: cows. And the high presence of the virus in the mammary glands and milk of these animals suggests that the contamination of the milking machines may have played an important role in the transmission of the pathogen', Gonz√°lez wrote. However, it is still unclear how the virus is transmitted between cows. Gonz√°lez concluded that 'we are facing the worst global crisis in the history of H5N1 avian influenza and there is growing uncertainty about the impact it can have on humans. It is essential to elevate surveillance, efficiently and agilely communicate new cases, increase transparency, and reinforce prevention and control measures.'

**Global Alert Issued as Avian Flu Virus Spreads Through Cow Milking**
A global alert has been issued due to the spread of the avian flu virus, H5N1, which has been identified as a new transmission route through cow milking. Since its discovery in a Chinese goose farm in 1996, the virus has evolved, affecting over 485 bird species and 48 mammal species worldwide. Between 2003 and November 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) documented 880 human cases of avian flu, resulting in 460 deaths in 23 countries. The current outbreak, starting in 2024, has affected farms in the United States, and a new study published in Nature has identified cow milking as a new transmission route in US livestock farms. The study found that H5N1 has infected cows in 231 farms across 14 US states, prompting alarms in Europe. Although it was thought that the virus mainly affected birds, this finding has highlighted the possibility that cattle can also be a source of transmission. Additionally, four workers from these farms have contracted the virus, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported the first human case of avian flu without direct contact with infected animals. The virus could be transmitted through milk supplies, as a team from the Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Medicine at the College of Veterinarians of Kansas has identified that the mammary glands of dairy cows are the primary focus of infection. In June 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) observed signs of the virus in 20% of milk supplies. This finding raises the possibility that Europe, where milking procedures are not significantly different, may also face a similar risk. Virologist Thomas Peacock warns that 'containment strategies are not working.' In an article published in Nature, Peacock asserts that we are at a 'turning point,' as the H5N1 virus could become permanent in both the Americas and Europe. The virus has also been detected in European fur farms, increasing concern about its spread to other species and industrial sectors. Financial support has been requested to implement new detection technologies, and the European Commission has signed a contract for the purchase of 665,000 doses of the H5N1 vaccine, with the option to acquire up to 40 million additional doses.

**World Dairy Expo says it's staying non-partisan by denying Trump campaign stop**
The World Dairy Expo in Madison has declined a request from former President Donald Trump's campaign to make a stop at the event. According to Lisa Behnke, communications manager for World Dairy Expo, the decision was made due to logistical reasons and a desire to keep the event apolitical. Behnke stated, 'We host an event for cows and people who care for cows and not for candidates. We're staying in our lane.' The expo, which attracts over 50,000 attendees from across North America and visitors from overseas, is focused on showcasing dairy cattle and providing a platform for the industry to share information with candidates and elected officials. Despite the decline, Behnke expressed gratitude for the opportunity to host the event and emphasized the importance of taking precautions against Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1), also known as bird flu, which has been detected in dairy herds in 14 states. The expo is taking special precautions to ensure the safety of the valuable purebred cattle that come to Madison, including working with veterinary experts from USDA and the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.

**34 Dairy Farms In California Affected By Bird Flu Outbreaks**
The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) has reported that 34 dairy farms in the Central Valley have confirmed cases of the highly pathogenic H5-N1 avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu. Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, stated that farmers are 'deeply concerned' about the situation and feel that it is not yet fully under control. The dairy industry is hopeful for the development of a vaccine specifically for cows that would also meet trade regulations. Although the risk to humans remains low, experts have expressed concerns that the prolonged presence of the virus on dairy farms could potentially allow it to combine with human viruses, increasing the potential threat to public health. California leads the nation in milk production, with 1.7 million dairy cows generating 3.37 billion pounds of milk in August, accounting for nearly 19% of the national output for that month, as reported by the USDA.

**CDC Continues to Respond to Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Outbreak**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to respond to the public health challenge posed by the outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) in multiple states in the United States. Since April 2024, 14 human cases of infection with the avian influenza A(H5) virus have been reported in the US. Four of these cases were associated with exposure to infected dairy cows, and nine with exposure to infected poultry. The risk of contracting avian influenza H5 for the general public remains low. The USDA reports that 213 dairy herds in 14 US states have confirmed cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infections in dairy cows. The CDC is working with the USDA, FDA, ASPR, state and local health officials, and other partners to monitor the situation and prevent the spread of the virus. The CDC is also conducting serosurveys to assess past exposure to H5 viruses among veterinarians and other veterinary professionals. The CDC is posting a new webpage describing influenza surveillance activities for the 2024-2025 flu season, which include monitoring of wastewater for influenza A virus and avian influenza A(H5) in the US. The CDC recommends that people avoid contact with sick or dead animals, including wild and domestic birds, and avoid exposure to animal waste, unpasteurized milk, and materials that have been in contact with infected animals. The CDC also recommends that people who have contact with animals during their work should know the risk of exposure to avian influenza viruses and take the necessary precautions. 'It is essential to reduce the risk of people and contain the risk for public health in general,' said the CDC.
