**Could Buying Apple Today Set You Up for Life?**
Apple has been a wildly successful investment over the past 20 years, generating a total return of 26,720%. Its strong brand, high pricing power, and customer loyalty have contributed to its success. However, with a high price-to-earnings ratio of 37 and a projected annualized earnings growth of 10.9% over the next three years, the stock may not be a good value for new investors. Warren Buffett still holds a significant stake in Apple, but the author believes that the future returns will not be as good as the past, due to the company's huge scale and expensive valuation.

**NVIDIA pips Apple as the world's most valuable company again thanks to growing AI wave**
NVIDIA has surpassed Apple to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of $3.43 trillion. This marks the second time NVIDIA has claimed this title, driven by the growing demand for artificial intelligence. NVIDIA's stock has almost tripled in 2024, with revenue more than doubling for five consecutive quarters. Apple, while still seeing gains, has had a relatively modest rise of 17 per cent in 2024, and is focusing on AI features that run directly on devices. NVIDIA's success underscores the evolving tech landscape, where AI has become the key driver of market value. The company will soon enter the Dow Industrial Average, replacing Intel, further cementing its status as a tech titan.

**Apple Earnings: Stock Wavers Despite Strong iPhone Sales**
Apple reported better-than-expected revenue, despite a $10.2 billion tax hit due to a September ruling that wiped away the company's special tax status in Ireland. The tax charge sent Apple's net income to $93.7 billion, the company's lowest since 2020. Apple remains the world's largest technology company by profits, with a market capitalization of $3.5 trillion. However, the company's earnings growth has been slow, with adjusted profits up 25% last quarter compared to 2022. The release of Apple Intelligence, a generative AI operating system, could inspire a reacceleration in iPhone sales, with average analyst forecasts calling for $72.4 billion in iPhone revenue during the quarter ending in December, a record high.

Wall Street is expected to rise on Monday, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq indices projected to increase by 0.6%, 0.5%, and 0.8%, respectively.

This could potentially put Nvidia back in the top spot as the world's largest capitalized company, surpassing Apple.

This week's economic calendar includes the release of the Dallas Fed's October manufacturing index, the balance of international trade in goods for September, and the Case-Shiller and FHFA housing price indices for August.

**The Race to a $4 Trillion Market Cap: Apple, Nvidia, or Microsoft**
Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft are the top three companies in the world by market cap, with Apple sitting at $3.6 trillion. Nvidia's market cap is just above $3.5 trillion, thanks to its essential role in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, while Microsoft's market cap is at $3.1 trillion. Apple's AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence, were unveiled at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, but were not ready for the iPhone 16 launch in September. Apple Intelligence will be available on newer iPhones, but hundreds of millions of iPhone owners will need to upgrade their devices to access it. Analyst Dan Ives predicts a 'super cycle' driven by AI interest, which could lead to record iPhone sales of 240 million in fiscal 2025. A stronger-than-expected upgrade cycle and progress toward direct monetization of AI features could propel Apple's stock to the $4 trillion level, but it needs to outperform single-digit percentage revenue growth expectations for next year to justify a $4 trillion valuation.

**Why Apple will be first to $4T market cap**
Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives believes Apple will be the first US stock to reach a $4 trillion market cap, followed by Nvidia and Microsoft. Ives predicts Apple's 'AI-driven supercycle' will start in the December quarter, driven by the rollout of Apple Intelligence and the potential for 20% of the world's population to access AI through an Apple device. He estimates iPhone units will exceed 240 million this year. Ives also notes that there is a 'pent-up upgrade opportunity' for 300 million iPhones that haven't been upgraded in four-plus years, making it a 'multi-year supercycle.' He expects Apple to hit $4 trillion first, followed by Nvidia in mid-2025 and then Microsoft.

**Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?**
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is rapidly closing the gap with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in terms of valuation, with a market cap of $3.13 trillion compared to Apple's $3.37 trillion. While Apple's revenue is significantly higher at $385 billion, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue, with a 122% year-over-year increase in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Nvidia's growth potential is driven by its graphics processing units (GPUs) powering the AI revolution, and its upcoming Blackwell architecture, which is expected to unlock massive speed gains. Analysts believe Nvidia's revenue will grow around 42% next year, far outpacing Apple's projections of 8% growth. However, Nvidia still generates about half the profits of Apple, but with its growth pace and stronger profit margin, it could quickly catch Apple's profit levels. By the end of the next fiscal year, Nvidia could be right there with Apple in terms of profits. Next comes valuation, where Nvidia's strong growth and brand could fetch a higher premium than Apple, potentially propelling it to overtake Apple as the world's largest company.

Global market capitalization has surpassed its previous peak of $123,000 billion, set in October 2021, reaching over $124,000 billion, according to Bloomberg data.

The world's largest listed company, Apple, accounts for 2.8% of the total market capitalization, with a value of $3,463 billion. The US equity market contributes around 47% to the total, with a value of $58,000 billion.

**Apple off to strong start with first weekend of iPhone 16 sales**
Apple's iPhone 16 has experienced a strong start in terms of pre-order demand, according to Wedbush Securities. The brokerage firm estimates that iPhone 16 sales will increase by a high single-digit or even double-digit percentage, starting with the December quarter. Wedbush analysts, led by Daniel Ives, predict that Apple will surpass its previous record for annual iPhone unit sales and achieve a market capitalization of $4 trillion by 2025. Ives stated, 'This is the beginning of an AI driven iPhone supercycle that should enable Apple to break its historical mark for iPhone units in a year and translate into a $4 trillion market cap for Cupertino in 2025.' Wedbush expects the iPhone 16 upgrade cycle to be more than 90 million units initially, with demand 'tracking well' globally. The company could sell over 240 million units in fiscal 2025, buoyed by a robust December quarter and demand.
