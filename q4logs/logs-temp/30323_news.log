**Maryland video game studio reacts to volatile industry by unionizing**
The video game industry is experiencing widespread layoffs despite reporting record revenue. According to Farhan Noor, a technical artist for Riot Games, over 10,000 developers lost their jobs in 2023, and as of November 15, 2024, an estimated 14,000 have been laid off. The industry's consolidation around platform owners like Microsoft and Sony has led to a decrease in spending, resulting in massive layoffs. However, Bethesda Game Studios, known for titles like 'Fallout' and 'The Elder Scrolls,' has become a leader in unionization efforts. The studio was recognized as the first wall-to-wall union at a Microsoft video game studio in July 2024. Union members organized with help from CODE-CWA and ZeniMax Workers United, a union among quality assurance personnel in Bethesda's parent company. According to Joost van Dreunen, the CEO of ALDORA, unionization is a response to the industry's history of poor employment practices, including crunch time. Taylor Welling, a content producer at Bethesda, hopes that unions will become more common, offering employees protections and benefits.

**Is the Era of Remote Work Coming to an End?**
Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, has announced that the company will end its hybrid work model, requiring administrative employees to return to the office full-time. Failure to comply may result in termination. This decision has been met with resistance from employees, with 73% of administrative staff reportedly seeking new jobs. The move has sparked debate about the future of remote work and its benefits. Nicholas Bloom, an economist from Stanford University, acknowledges that remote work can hinder learning, innovation, and communication, but also highlights its benefits for work-life balance and employee well-being. Other companies, such as Microsoft and Google, have stated that they will maintain a hybrid work model, but only if productivity remains high. The article suggests that companies should strive for a balance between employee satisfaction and productivity, rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all approach.

**DOJ Will Push Google To Divest Chrome, Verily Also Looks To Pull Away**
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) plans to ask a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome web browser, citing its 66.68% market share in October 2024. However, at least one Alphabet business, Verily, is already planning to separate from Google. Verily aims to cut ties with Google by December 16, 2024, and build its own infrastructure to support life sciences. According to January Digital CEO Vic Drabicky, breaking up Google may not have the desired effect in the market, as the company would still be a dominant player in many areas. Meanwhile, the DOJ's proposed remedies have raised concerns among advertisers and marketers, who fear that forcing Google to divest Chrome would harm small businesses. As one executive director stated, 'The DOJ’s proposed remedies would severely harm America’s small business owners... Radically altering the way these tools operate and integrate will create significant disruptions for small businesses — and claiming otherwise is disingenuous.'

**10 New York Jobs Most At Risk For Layoffs In 2025**
According to The Staffing Hub, nearly 40% of companies plan to replace employees with artificial intelligence (AI) in 2025. Of those who will use AI, 17% expect layoffs due to AI and 21% consider it probable. However, 82% of companies surveyed plan to hire new employees in 2025, and 53% view AI as a productivity booster. Top economists at the American Bankers Association predict a 30% chance of a recession in 2025. Despite this, the article identifies 10 New York jobs most at risk for layoffs in 2025, citing various sources, but does not specify which jobs are at risk. 'While layoffs due to AI could happen, more than three-quarters (82%) of companies surveyed plan to hire new employees in 2025. AI isn't the devil. It's also viewed as a productivity booster, as more than half (53%) of those surveyed agree the technology makes their workforce much more productive.'

**Goodbye to big tech’s big perks? S’pore workers say global techlash has come for their benefits**
Big tech companies in Singapore are cutting back on perks and benefits, a shift that employees say is a result of the post-pandemic period and the tech industry's cutbacks. According to 11 current and former employees at Apple, ByteDance, Microsoft, Google, and Meta, the golden era of big tech perks and benefits may be coming to a close. Thomas, a former Meta employee, recalls how his team was disbanded overnight in 2022, and he notes that the signs of cuts to employee perks were there, including being reassigned to lower-value chain work and the reduction of employee benefits. He says, 'Every tech company is doing layoffs, so the tech sector is definitely not as safe as it used to be, but it’s not so much the layoffs that changed how I look at the industry – it’s supply and demand.' A CNN analysis found that between 2019 and 2022, Meta and Google’s parent company Alphabet had increased their headcount by 103 per cent and 64 per cent respectively, but employees are now paying the price for the industry's misjudgment of its growth.

**What do recent tech layoffs expose about our job reality?**
The recent tech layoffs have exposed the intersection of technology, humanity, and culture in a way that no algorithm can fully calculate. Major players such as Google, Intel, Tesla, and Amazon have been drastically downsizing their workforce, impacting roles across various departments. The layoffs have been carried out with varying degrees of ruthlessness, reflecting the unique business cultures, legal frameworks, and societal values of different regions. In the US, layoffs are fast and brutal, with companies prioritizing efficiency over personal impact. In Israel, layoffs are more personal and emotionally charged, with companies often going to great lengths to cushion the blow. In Europe, layoffs are fought, with strong labor laws, unions, and a deep cultural commitment to workers' rights. The tech layoffs of 2024 reflect not just economic realities but cultural truths, revealing as much about a company's values as its balance sheet. 'The human cost of rapid layoffs is often overlooked, sparking anger and frustration among workers who feel disposable,' said the writer, a corporate cross-cultural business consultant. 'These layoffs expose the intersection of technology, humanity, and culture in a way that no algorithm can fully calculate.'

**Alternative Apple: A breath of fresh air when technology companies collectively lay off employees**
According to foreign media reports, technology companies began large-scale layoffs in the second half of 2022, with Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent company Alphabet, and Intel laying off over 10,000 employees. However, Apple is a clear winner in this situation. Although they laid off hundreds of outsourced employees and stopped most hiring at the end of 2022, they only laid off about 600 employees after abandoning the car project code-named 'Titan'. Apple's layoffs are not large, with approximately 164,000 full-time employees worldwide by the end of 2024. This is a significant increase from their total number of employees, which grew from 132,000 in fiscal year 2018 to 154,000. This indicates that Apple will continue to expand its scale in the coming period.

**Tech Giants Invest Heavily in AI, Despite Concerns About Effectiveness**
The tech giants are investing heavily in AI, with a total of over $200 billion allocated for the development of this technology in 2024. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet (Google) are leading the charge, with each company committing significant funds to AI research and development. Despite concerns about the effectiveness of AI, the tech giants are convinced that the long-term benefits will outweigh the costs. They argue that AI will lead to increased efficiency, cost savings, and revenue growth. However, the industry is facing challenges, including a shortage of skilled workers and the need for expensive hardware and data centers. The tech giants are also facing criticism for their handling of layoffs, with many employees being let go in recent months. According to Layoffs.fyi, the IT sector has already seen 143,000 job losses this year, with Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft being among the companies that have implemented significant layoffs. Despite these challenges, the tech giants remain committed to their AI strategies, with many seeing it as a key driver of future growth and innovation.

**Tech layoffs continue in October 2024 as Dropbox, Tidal, Meta, and other high-profile companies cut jobs ahead of the holidays**
Dropbox has initiated one of the largest layoffs for October, cutting 20% of its workforce, or 528 individuals. According to CEO Drew Houston, 'Maintaining our current structure and investment levels is no longer sustainable,' citing softening demand and macro headwinds in the core business. Houston also acknowledged that the company's organizational structure has become overly complex, with excess layers of management slowing it down. This move comes as the company faces stiff competition from major tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Google, which offer free and paid cloud storage plans.

**Big tech loses some shine ahead of a big earnings week. But 'where else are you going to get that type of growth potential?'**
Big tech companies, including Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon, are set to report their quarterly earnings this week. Despite concerns about an 'AI bubble' and the impact of artificial intelligence on the US energy grid, analysts still expect double-digit-percentage per-share profit growth for Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon. Microsoft and Apple are expected to show single-digit gains. Analysts will be watching for updates on company-specific matters, such as Google's AI assistant Gemini and Meta's Llama AI models. Other tech companies, like Apple and Amazon, will offer more direct detail on shopper spending patterns. Meanwhile, Intel's quarterly results on Thursday will be closely watched, as the company has faltered in its efforts to catch up on AI and has announced plans to lay off thousands of employees.

**Amenaza de disolución de Google: ¿hay algo positivo en la medida?**
Bank of America analysts have analyzed the remedies proposed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) against Alphabet (Google) for its supposed monopoly in search services, highlighting 'some positive aspects to consider' despite the potential threat of breakup. The analysts noted that Google remains well-positioned in the search market, with users likely to choose Google even without exclusive agreements. They also pointed out that Alphabet's planned counterproposals in December could lead to a more favorable outcome. Additionally, the bank noted that Alphabet trades at a discount to its break-up value and has a lower layoff risk compared to its peers, leaving room for growth in the BPA with the new CFO. Despite the challenges, Bank of America maintains a 'Buy' rating for Alphabet with a price target of $206.

**Silent Layoffs Surge in Silicon Valley As Tech Giants Aim To Avoid Bad Press, Adopt Techniques Like 'Work From Office' To Trigger Job Cuts: Report**
Silent or stealth layoffs have become a common practice among tech companies in Silicon Valley to avoid bad press and reduce employee headcounts. According to Layoffs.Fyi, 457 tech companies have laid off 139,534 employees since the start of 2024. Companies like Microsoft, Google, Northvolt, Apple, IBM, Intel, Dell, and Luminar have implemented silent layoffs. The report highlights that companies use techniques like 'Work From Office' mandates to trigger job cuts without making official announcements. For example, Amazon's 5-day return-to-office mandate has led to nearly 1,900 employees looking for job changes. Google's 2023 layoffs, announced through a 2 AM email, became a PR nightmare and attracted negative press. The report notes that silently laying off employees does not affect the remaining staff and is a way for companies to avoid making headlines.

**Tech Layoffs Continue in 2024: Over 139,000 Job Cuts in 451 Companies**
The tech sector is experiencing a significant wave of layoffs in 2024, with over 139,206 job cuts in 451 tech companies, according to the independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. Companies such as Tesla, Amazon, Google, TikTok, Snap, and Microsoft have made significant layoffs in the first months of 2024. Even smaller startups have seen a considerable number of layoffs, and in some cases, have shut down operations entirely. The reason for the layoffs is the focus on artificial intelligence, which is accompanied by an increasing attention to costs. The layoffs in 2024 are targeted at sectors that are less profitable. According to McKinsey, by 2030, at least 14% of workers may need to change jobs due to digitalization, robotics, and artificial intelligence. The first companies that can afford to take this path are those that control, to a large extent, the development of the technologies they themselves must use. This is the necessary choice that guides the organizational restructuring that will lead to an increase in employees in more innovative areas and a reduction in employment in less profitable areas.

**Tech Layoffs Reach Alarming Levels in 2024**
According to a study by BestBrokers, 211,033 employees have been laid off in 194 tech companies worldwide so far this year, in addition to the 260,000 layoffs registered in 2023. This brings the total number of tech layoffs between 2022 and 2023 to over 400,000, with a 59% increase in layoffs in the tech industry last year. Women have been disproportionately affected by these layoffs, with 56.9% of recent layoffs occurring in US-based companies. Dell, Intel, and Tesla are among the companies leading the trend, with 18,500, 15,000, and 14,000 layoffs, respectively, driven by fierce competition and declining sales. Google has also confirmed a new round of layoffs, citing a need to reduce costs and optimize investment performance. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is a major factor in these layoffs, as companies seek to reduce costs and invest in AI, which is a rapidly growing area. Many young people who graduated with degrees in tech are now struggling to find work, and some are turning to non-tech jobs. According to a recent survey, three out of five workers fear losing their jobs in the next decade due to AI, and two out of five expect their salaries to decline as a result of AI.

**Thousands laid off in August and September in the technology sector as the global jobs bloodbath intensifies**
The tech industry has seen a massive wave of layoffs, with over 137,500 workers laid off by over 400 companies worldwide, according to Layoffs.fyi. This year, Google laid off over 12,000 workers, while Amazon announced a mandatory return to office for five-days-a-week scheduling starting January 2025. The layoffs are driven by the pressure from hedge funds, investment firms, and billionaires to drive up corporate valuations through 'restructuring' measures, i.e., the destruction of jobs. The working class is being targeted by the ruling class, with highly educated and skilled workers being treated as disposable. The wealth generated by the labor of the working class is concentrated in the hands of a shrinking elite, while tech billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Tim Cook have seen their wealth soar. The layoffs in the tech sector are the result of the drive to maximize profits, often at the expense of long-term growth, stability, and workers' rights.
