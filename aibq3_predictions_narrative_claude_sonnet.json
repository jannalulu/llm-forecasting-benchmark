Unlike April's attack which caused no fatalities, Iran needed to save face after Haniyeh was killed within their borders.

Short-term ceasefires rarely translate into lasting peace in this region. Even with the US pushing for a deal and Hezbollah's conditional offer to halt attacks, Netanyahu's domestic political pressures and Hamas's position made a sustained 30-day ceasefire unlikely.\n\nPhilip: Indeed.
