The regulatory pressures in the EU for USB-C standardization probably played a role too.\n\nNate: And let's be honest - the market research must have shown considerable consumer resistance.

The models considered the teams' scoring patterns throughout the tournament.\"\n\nNate: \"And the timing of our last data point - just 48 hours before the semis - gave us a precise window into team dynamics and injuries.\"\n\nPhilip: [nodding] \"Tournament football at its finest.\"",

Though we could only use data up to July 8th, the team form indicators and knockout stage scoring patterns from previous tournaments gave us strong signals.\"\n\nPhilip: \"Once again, the superforecasting approach proves its worth.
