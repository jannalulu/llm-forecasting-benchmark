This version has an extended resolution date.*\n\n---\n\nIn early 2016, two Caltech Professors -- Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown -- created a major media splash by predicting the existence of [Planet Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Nine), a new, but as-yet unseen planet in the outer solar system. As originally envisioned, their trans-Neptunian world has an orbital period of about 20,000 years and a super-Earth mass more than sufficient to bring the Solar System's planetary inventory back up to nine.\n\n[Batygin and Brown's paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/151/2/22), has been downloaded well over half a million times, and presents indirect dynamical evidence for the planet's existence. Its presence is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of the most distant Pluto-like worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit.\n\n[Follow-up papers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....151...22B/citations) by a range of authors have added a mixture of credibility, detail, and skepticism to the Planet Nine hypothesis. In the years since the announcement of the hypothesis, Planet Nine has been invoked as an [explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04992) for the generation of highly inclined Kuiper belt objects such as Drac and Niku, it has been argued that it [can account for curious orbital commensurabilities](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153...91M/abstract) among the most distant members of the Kuiper Belt, and it has been [hypothesized that it can explain](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153...27G/abstract) the 6-degree tilt of the planetary orbits relative to the Sun's equator.\n\nThe planet, however, remains to be found.\n\nIf it does exist, its most likely sky location is probably in one of the two regions of the sky where the Galactic Plane intersects the ecliptic. Confusion from the myriad stars of the Milky Way's disk renders systematic searches difficult in these areas. Nonetheless, new techniques, such as the [use of data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06383) from NASA's TESS Mission may potentially provide a breakthrough. Additionally, Batygin and co-authors have published [an update](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10103) to their original paper that contains a significant amount of new analysis and remains optimistic regarding the prospects for eventual detection.",

The French semi-presidential system gives President Macron political responsibilities, in particular in foreign policy, regardless of the makeup of Parliament; but he must also nominate a Prime Minister, who conducts domestic policy. The government does not need a positive confidence vote from legislators, but it could be subject to a vote of no confidence; current Prime Minister Gabriel Attal's minority government has been relying on case-by-case deals to get legislation approved.\n\nWhile the far-right has already elected 38 Deputies and made it to the runoff almost everywhere, its surge might still be forestalled by the strategic pact between the center and the left.",

According to an analysis from [The Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/will-kamala-harris-get-a-bump-from-low-gas-prices-in-the-november-u-s-elections/articleshow/113298086.cms?from=mdr):\n\n>The decline is mostly the result of a confluence of economic factors rather than the direct intervention of the Biden administration. However, it might provide Vice President Harris with favourable obstacles regarding financial matters during the last few months of the campaign.\n\n>The COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 are two examples of recent global events that have caused higher gas prices. According to Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, the market is coming into a better sense of balance. So it certainly is good news for the incumbent party, potentially, that gas prices are falling, though he expects there will continue to be a lot of noise from politicians on both sides of the aisle on this issue. \n\nIt is also important to note that historically there can be a lot of volatility in gas prices during election years: \n\n<img src=\"https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/PlattsContent/_assets/_images/latest-news/f02e3ee4-fbc8-462f-b448-69d7fc39927b.svg\" />\n\nPlease see chart of recent retail gas prices [here](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_gas_price).",

Stacked batteries are common in electric vehicles and medical devices, but are an emerging technology for smartphones.\n\n>The stacked battery could come alongside faster 40W wired charging and 20W MagSafe charging.\n\n>The iPhone 16 battery is expected to have an updated stainless steel casing that allows for higher energy density, ultimately bringing a density increase of up to 10 percent. That could lead to longer battery life, but this isn't a feature that is likely to come to all iPhone 16 models.\n\n>EU law requires smartphone manufacturers create batteries that can be replaced by owners using easily accessible tools, and Apple will need to implement support by 2025. Apple is planning to adopt a new battery replacement method for at least one iPhone 16 model, encasing the battery in metal rather than foil. With a low volt of electricity, the battery will be able to removed from the chassis, which would eliminate the need for adhesive and ease repairs.\n\n>Rumors suggest that most of the iPhone 16 models will see a small increase in battery life.\n",

    "background": "Lithium carbonate, a key component in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, has experienced a significant price decline in recent months. As of September 2024, lithium carbonate prices in China have stabilized at around CNY 75,000 per tonne, the lowest level in over three years, before dropping again to 72,500 to close out the first week of trading. \n\nThis recent decline in lithium prices is part of a larger trend that has seen spot prices [fall over 80% since December 2022](https://www.bradley.com/insights/publications/2024/02/lithium-prices-in-free-fall-implications-for-clean-energy-transition-in-the-private-sector). The sudden deceleration in demand for lithium, particularly in the EV industry, caught suppliers by surprise, leading to a surplus that placed downward pressure on prices.\n\nDespite the current slump, the long-term outlook for lithium demand remains strong, as governments and private sector initiatives continue to push for a transition away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy solutions. According to a study by [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/battery-2030-resilient-sustainable-and-circular), global demand for lithium-ion batteries is predicted to grow from around 700 gigawatt hours (GWh) in 2022 to 4,700 GWh in 2030, driven primarily by EVs, stationary storage, and consumer electronics.\n\n[S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/121923-us-canada-lithium-prospects-hope-to-advance-in-2024-despite-headwinds) projects that lithium carbonate prices will stabilize near current levels in a range between $20,000/mt and $25,000/mt from 2024 to 2027. However, given the recent volatility and the potential for further market disruptions, the question remains whether lithium carbonate prices will continue to decline in the near term, potentially falling below CNY 70,000 per tonne before October 1, 2024.",

The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.\n\n> For each pollutant an AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to an ambient air concentration that equals the level of the short-term national ambient air quality standard for protection of public health. AQI values at or below 100 are generally thought of as satisfactory. When AQI values are above 100, air quality is unhealthy: at first for certain sensitive groups of people, then for everyone as AQI values get higher.\n\nHistorical data is [available from the EPA](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data) and short-term forecasts are [available from AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/state/?name=district-of-columbia).\n\nAs of July 29, 2024, there has been one day in the third quarter of 2024 with an AQI above 150, occurring on July 5, 2024, when the AQI was reported to be 166.",
