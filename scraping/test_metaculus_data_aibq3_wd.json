A similar rate of rocket attacks have continued to this day.\n\nWhilst Israel has excellent air and rocket defence capabilities, there have been incidents where attacks have penetrated it's defences, two notable examples are listed below:\n\n- [2024 Iranian strikes against Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Iranian_strikes_against_Israel). (*No deaths reported*.)\n- [2024 Houthi drone attack on Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Houthi_drone_attack_on_Israel). (*Single death reported*.)\n\nThe aforementioned attacks have typically resulted in, or have been, \"tit-for-tat\" retaliations. For example, prior to the Iranian strikes on Israel, the IDF carried out an airstrike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus. The IDF responded to the Iranian reltalation with [strikes on Isfahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_strikes_on_Iran), but these were smaller in scale attacks, widely seen as an effort to deescalate tensions.\n\nAmidst the ongoing strikes exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah, reports emerged that more than 1,000 people \u2013 including Hezbollah fighters and medics \u2013 were [wounded on Tuesday, September 17](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/dozens-hezbollah-members-wounded-lebanon-when-pagers-exploded-sources-witnesses-2024-09-17/) when the pagers used to communicate exploded across Lebanon in what is likely seen as a serious escalation of the Israel-Hezbollah Conflict.", "open_time": "2024-09-19T14:30:00Z", "actual_close_time": "2024-09-20T14:30:00Z", "scheduled_resolve_time": "2024-10-01T20:09:00Z", "actual_resolve_time": "2024-10-01T20:09:00Z", "status": "resolved", "type": "binary", "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves to \"Yes\" if before October 1, 2024, credible reports indicate that an attack occurring within Israel's borders has led to the death of at least five (5) individuals.", "resolution": "no", "fine_print": "The attack must additionally meet the following conditions for the question to resolve to \"Yes\":\n\n- Occur within the area demarcated as \"Israel\" on the [Institute for the Study of War's map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/2e746151991643e39e64780f0674f7dd) covering the 2023-2024 Israel-Gaza conflict. For the avoidance of doubt, an attack occuring within areas indicated as Gaza, the West Bank or the Golan Heights on the map will not be sufficient for a positive resolution. Israel's internal waters and territorial sea (the latter being Israel's sovereign waters up to 12 nautical miles from the shore) will be considered \"within Israel\" for the purposes of this question. More distant territorial waters beyond the territorial sea (e.g. contiguous zone, exclusive economic zone, etc.) will not be considered \"within Israel.\"\n- The attack must be kinetic, involving weaponry or physical force. Cyberattacks, even if resulting in fatalities, will not count towards the resolution of this question.\n- The threshold of five (5) fatalities must be reached within a 24-hour period.\n\nThese fatalities do not need to occur at the same location; coordinated attacks on multiple targets or simultaneous assassinations will meet this criterion.
