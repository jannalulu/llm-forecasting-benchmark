In the endowed condition, participants were told that they were on course to learn a specific bundle of three facts and were then offered the option to learn a separate bundle of four facts instead. In the nonendowed condition, participants were simply offered a choice between learning a bundle of three or a separate bundle of four facts, with the bundles shown in randomized order. \n\nResults of a chi-square goodness-of-fit test indicated that participants in the endowed condition were more likely to express a preference for learning three (versus four) facts than participants in the nonendowed condition. This supported the original researchers\u2019 hypothesis that individuals exhibit the endowment effect for non-instrumental information.\n\nIn our study, we followed the same procedure, except that we distinguished between the half of the nonendowed condition where the 3-fact bundle was displayed on top and the half where the 4-fact bundle was displayed on top (these were represented by Conditions 2 and 3 respectively in the diagram above), so that we could conduct an additional analysis in case order effects had been contributing to the original study results (explained below). For the purposes of assessing whether the original study replicated in our dataset, however, Conditions 2 and 3 were pooled into one combined nonendowed condition. This means that our pooled Conditions 2 and 3 are together equivalent to (a larger version of) the original study\u2019s nonendowed condition. (For details, see ***The Details*** section.)\n\nNone of the facts presented were of objectively greater utility or interest than any of the others. Facts related to, for example, the behavior of a particular animal, or the fact that the unicorn is the national animal of a country. Furthermore, each time we ran the experiment, we randomized which facts appeared in which order across both bundles. The subjective utility of a given fact would not be expected to affect experimental results due to this randomization process.\n\nThe original study included 146 adult participants from Prolific. Our replication included 631 adult participants (not counting exclusions) from MTurk via Positly.com.\n\n### The Details\n\nIn the original experiment, two variables had varied across conditions - both endowment *and* the order of presentation of the two bundles had varied. Option order had been randomized within the endowed condition such that a 3-fact bundle was shown on top half the time while a 4-fact bundle was shown on top the other half of the time within that condition. On the other hand, option order was not randomized in the endowed condition: the 3-fact bundle was always shown on top within that condition. To control for ordering effects, we increased sample size to 1.5 times our original planned size and split the nonendowed condition (now double the size it would otherwise have been) into two separate conditions: Conditions 2 and 3. Our participants were randomized into one of three conditions, as described below:\n\n* Condition 1: Endowed - Participants were told that they were on course to learn a specific bundle of three facts and were then offered the option to learn four different facts instead.\n* Condition 2: Nonendowed with 3-fact bundle displayed on top - Participants were offered a choice between learning three facts or four facts, with the bundle of 3 facts appearing as the top option.\n* Condition 3: Nonendowed with 4-fact bundle displayed on top - Participants were offered a choice between learning three facts or four facts, with the bundle of 4 facts appearing as the top option\n\n### Analysis\n\nTo evaluate the replicability of the original study, we ran a chi-square goodness-of-fit test to evaluate differences in preference for learning three facts between participants in the endowed versus the pooled nonendowed conditions. As stated in our pre-registration, our policy was to consider the study to have replicated if this test yielded a statistically significant result, with the difference in the same direction as the original finding (i.e., with a higher proportion of participants selecting the 3-fact bundle in the endowed compared to the pooled nonendowed conditions)."}, {"title": "Will Israel expand its ground invasion to the city of Rafah before June 1, 2024?", "id": 22298, "open_time": "2024-04-11T20:00:00Z", "actual_close_time": "2024-05-13T18:00:00Z", "status": "resolved", "type": "binary", "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve **Yes** if the [Institute for the Study of War](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/2e746151991643e39e64780f0674f7dd) (ISW) reports Israeli military operations on its map at any of six locations surrounding Rafah (the specific locations are shown in the map embedded below) before June 1, 2024.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1VCJMA9AH4k8G6v33Yr6z254_umiNe4Q&ehbc=2E312F\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"}}>\n</iframe>", "resolution": "yes", "fine_print": "* Israeli military operations will be considered to be both of the following, or any similar entries added to the map:\n    * \"Reported Israeli clearing operations\"\n    * \"Claimed furthest Israeli advances\"\n* If Metaculus has reason to believe that the ISW map is no longer being updated or maintained the question will be **annulled**.\n* The coordinates of the six locations are as follows:\n    1. 31\u00b018'57.5\"N 34\u00b014'14.0\"E (Taiba Mosque)\n    2. 31\u00b018'44.8\"N 34\u00b015'04.9\"E (Helmi Saqr Sultan Mosque)\n    3. 31\u00b018'18.2\"N 34\u00b015'40.0\"E\n    4. 31\u00b017'31.8\"N 34\u00b016'21.0\"E\n    5. 31\u00b016'24.3\"N 34\u00b016'23.2\"E\n    6. 31\u00b015'41.0\"N 34\u00b015'29.8\"E"}, {"title": "Will Robert F.

Otherwise it will resolve as **No**.\n\n# Original Study Results\n\nThe primary hypothesis in the [original study](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120668119) was that in-person social portfolio diversity predicts higher well-being, even when controlling for the proportion of episodes in the day that included in-person social interaction.\n\nThe authors ran a linear regression predicting participants' well-being, with (1) social portfolio diversity and (2) the proportion of episodes in the day that included in-person social interaction as predictor variables. They found a positive, statistically significant (\\(p < 0.05\\)) coefficient for social portfolio diversity. We will consider this result to have replicated if we also find a positive, statistically significant coefficient for that variable when we run the same linear regression using newly-collected data.\n\n# Study Summary\n\n<img src=\"https://metaculus-media.s3.amazonaws.com/user_uploaded/Prediction_Version_-_Collins_et_al_Study_1_Diagram_UhNkYE8.jpeg\" alt=\"Summary of study 'Relation diversity in social portfolios predicts well-being\" />\n*[Higher resolution version available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xHYpaWcNHdes_fyF8vnzuK6p03ElWpa9/view?usp=sharing)*\n\nIn the [original study](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120668119) and in our replication, participants answered questions about their subjective well-being, then they filled out a diary reporting on their day the previous day. For each episode of their day they were asked if they were with anyone else in person. When they reported spending time in-person with others, they were asked to check off the relationship types they had with the people who were present (e.g., spouse/significant other, friends, co-workers, etc.) Participants then answered an attention check question and a few demographic questions.\n\nThe social portfolio diversity variable, in both the original study and in our replication, is calculated using the following equation:\n\n\\[H = -1*\\sum_{i=1}^s (p_i*\\ln p_i),\\]\n\nThe original study authors chose this formula because it is similar to Shannon\u2019s biodiversity index. The equation involves computing, for each of the relationship categories a person reported having interactions with, the proportion of their total interactions that this category represented (which the authors call \u201c\\(p_i\\)\u201d). For each category of relationship, this proportion is multiplied by its natural logarithm. Finally, all these products are summed together and multiplied by negative one so that the final result is a positive number.\n\nThe proportion of episodes of in-person social interaction is the number of episodes in the day reported with in-person social interaction over the total number of episodes reported for the day.\n\nThe well-being dependent variable is calculated by averaging two questions about subjective well-being, one asking about how happy the person has felt over the last 24 hours (from 0 to 10), and the other asking them to place themselves on a ladder from 0 to 10 representing how well their life is going.\n\nThe original study included 578 participants after excluding participants who failed the attention check. Our replication included 963 participants after excluding those who failed the attention check (which meant we had 90% power to detect an effect size as low as 75% of the original effect size) recruited from MTurk via [Positly](https://www.positly.com/).

Originally based in China, it is reportedly registered in the Cayman Islands.\n\nBinance temporarily halted trading on Tuesday, December 13, 2022, and [according to CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/14/binance-ceo-cz-deposits-coming-back-in-but-bumpy-road-ahead.html) its CEO, Changpeng Zhao (often referred to as \"CZ\"), stated in an internal memo:\n\n>While we expect the next several months to be bumpy, we will get past this challenging period \u2013 and we\u2019ll be stronger for having been through it.\n\nIn addition to the trading halt Binance has been under a long-running investigation by the US Department of Justice which is [reportedly nearing its conclusion](https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/12/12/binance-investigation-stalls-doj-disagrees/).\n\nThe collapse of FTX has raised concerns about the broader health of crypto organizations. FTX, headquartered in the Bahamas, [filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/11/sam-bankman-frieds-cryptocurrency-exchange-ftx-files-for-bankruptcy.html) on November 11, 2022. Prior to filing for bankruptcy FTX was often seen as a \"lender of last resort\" and signed several deals to purchase other crypto firms or that included the option to purchase, [such as with BlockFi](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/01/ftx-signs-a-deal-giving-it-the-option-to-buy-crypto-lender-blockfi-.html).\n\n[According to the legal firm Norton Rose Fulbright](https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en/knowledge/publications/8ef0322b/proposed-legislation-may-trip-up-international-bankruptcy-filings-in-the-united-states), foreign companies often seek US bankruptcy protection due to favorable conditions and a low threshold for eligibility:\n\n>A large driver of the US Bankruptcy Courts\u2019 popularity has been ease of access. The statutes that define the parameters of who can be a Chapter 11 debtor, and what court may oversee the restructuring, are extremely broad. Any entity that is domiciled in the US, has a place of business in the US, or has property in the US, may avail itself of Chapter 11. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109. A debtor further may file its petition in any venue where it is domiciled (i.e. incorporated), where its principal place of business in the US is located, where its principal assets in the US are located, or in any venue where any of its affiliates can file. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408. In contrast to other countries, the debtor need not be a domestic company to file for bankruptcy in the US Importantly, no threshold or minimum amount of assets located in the US is required to qualify. In fact, courts have considered bank accounts, attorney retainers, and even causes of action owned by a foreign debtor as property in the US for purposes of eligibility. This has allowed many international companies to restructure their debts in the US even though they hold very little assets in the US.\n\nAlso see a [supporting analysis by the legal firm Skadden](https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2021/06/quarterly-insights/international-companies-turn-to-us-restructurings). FTX's US filing has produced a [jurisdictional dispute](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/16/bahamian-liquidators-say-ftx-wasnt-authorized-to-file-for-bankruptcy-in-the-us/) with regulators in the Bahamas.\n\n***Will Binance or a subsidiary file for bankruptcy or be sold \"under duress\" before January 1, 2024?***\n\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before January 1, 2024, Binance or any of its subsidiaries have filed for bankruptcy or a similar filing of insolvency in any jurisdiction **OR** Binance has signed a deal to be purchased by or the option to be purchased by another organization, which has been characterized as a bail out, a rescue, or in response to liquidity trouble by [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions). Resolution will be determined according to information publicly available on or before February 1, 2024.\n\nFor the purposes of this question, a filing similar to bankruptcy will be said to have occurred if Binance or any of its subsidiaries have filed under the insolvency law of any jurisdiction, for example [liquidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation), [administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_(law)), or [winding up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands_bankruptcy_law#Winding_up_of_companies). These examples are not exhaustive, and any insolvency related filing in any jurisdiction considered, in the judgment of Metaculus, to be broadly similar will be sufficient.\n\n[fine-print]\nThe purchase or option to purchase by another organization on its own will not be sufficient, the purchase or option to purchase must be characterized by [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) as in response to liquidity or other problems as described.\n[/fine-print]", "resolution": "no", "fine_print": ""}, {"title": "In 2023 will any other war have more casualties than Russia-Ukraine?", "id": 14032, "open_time": "2022-12-22T05:00:00Z", "actual_close_time": "2023-12-31T23:00:00Z", "status": "resolved", "type": "binary", "resolution_criteria": "To clarify this question, Scott Alexander wrote:\r\n\r\n>We will judge casualties for the Ukraine war based on the sum of the UN estimate of civilian deaths + injuries, plus each side's report of the other side's deaths + injuries.

Lyndon Johnson was the President of the United States, The Beatles were finishing the White Album, and the United States Navy was trying to figure out why it was losing so many world-class fighter planes to a third-tier enemy in a place called Vietnam.\n\nTraditionally, Navy fighters had destroyed roughly ten or more enemy aircraft for everyone one they lost in return, for a loss-exchange-ratio \u2013 what everyone really wanted to call a *kill ratio* \u2013 of some 10:1. In its grimmest and most glorious battles such as the Navy preferred to remember, [this statistic might dive to around 2 or 3 to 1](https://gpsana.org/?p=3007); in dominating unequal battles [such as the Navy actually preferred to fight](https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/wars-conflicts-and-operations/world-war-ii/1944/battle-philippine-sea/turkey-shoot.html) it might climb even much higher still.\n\nBut in Vietnam, while the material factors all seemed to point towards the dominant, high ratio, the [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research) told the admirals the truth \u2013 that Vietnam's tiny, rookie air force of [mostly hopelessly obsolete Soviet cast-offs like the MiG-17 and -19](globalsecurity.org/military/world/vietnam/nva-nvaf.htm) was handling the first team very roughly, holding it to a kill ratio no better and perhaps somewhat worse than 2:1. Worse, new new MiG-21 was coming into Vietnamese service, with its high speed and air-to-air guided missiles.  The problem only seemed to be getting worse. But what even *was* the problem?\n\nWhen Navy Captain Frank Ault was tasked, in response to the shocking failures, with examining the Navy's process for acquiring and employing air-to-air missile systems, he chose to interpret his mandate broadly. Previous reviews had been too piecemeal, [he suggested.](https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/naval-aviation-history/ault-report.html) None \"addressed concurrently the aircraft-missile fire control system across the complete spectrum\".\n\nAult ultimately concluded that the problem was human and cultural. The Navy had gone all-in its new F-4 Phantom heavy interceptor-fighter and the high-tech, quantitative approach it embodied. Wars were to be fought by pushbutton and the enemy pre-emptively denied a vote, killed by missiles from beyond visual range before he had any opportunity to act. Chance and judgement were to be distrusted and eliminated. But this approach had broken down over Vietnam, where combat conditions had not corresponded to those envisioned by Pentagon planners. Enemies might be detected at long range, but in crowded multi-service and multi-national airspace, this gave no license to attack without first making a visual identification. Denied the ability to fight their preferred fight, F-4 pilots were being forced into close-range dogfights for which their aircraft and training were not designed. Even when ideal conditions did allow them to play to their airplanes' presumed strengths, returns were generally a pathetic fraction of what the numerical simulations had predicted. Results had been postulated based on calculations that were meaningless because they neglected the cumulative effects of stress, fear, and accumulated small human difficulties; what Claueswitz called [friction](https://www.clausewitz.com/readings/OnWar1873/BK1ch07.html).\n\nAult's answer was to set up a Fighter Weapons School at Miramar, California that would become known as TOPGUN, to teach the skills that had been lost. [\"We threw away the tactics manual and wrote our own,\" recalled](https://www.historynet.com/topgun-turns-50/) the school's first commander. [Equipment and budget were virtually nil,](https://www.defense.gov/News/Feature-Stories/Story/Article/2823132/it-started-in-a-parking-lot-topguns-history-revealed/) but personnel were exceptional. Training assignments were just four weeks long, but intense, realistic, and rewarding. Assignees, selected from among the most promising relatively new pilots, were expected to \"spread the gospel\" on their return to the fleet. It worked. When the halftime bell sounded, the [Paris Peace Talks collapsed,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Accords#Breakthrough_and_agreement) and President Nixon ordered a resumption of large-scale aerial warfare over North Vietnam, the Navy was ready. Navy kill ratios climbed back into the 10:1 regime and stayed there for the rest of the war, while the Air Force, which then had [not yet implemented its own equivalent of Top Gun,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_Red_Flag) continued to struggle.\n\nYears passed, Vietnam became for Americans only a painful memory, and TOPGUN continued. It was 1983, some thirteen years after the first, 01-69 class graduated; Ronald Reagan was president, U2 had just released the *War* album, and magazine writer Ehud Yonay [painted an indelible portrait of how the school looked in the early 1980s for *California* magazine.](http://www.topgunbio.com/top-guns-by-ehud-yonay/) \"In those days,\" his own subjects [would later observe,](https://www.usna1978.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/THE-STORY-BEHIND.pdf)\n\n> before high definition video and Go-Pro type cameras, the written word combined with still photography was the only practical and affordable way to convey to others what flying fighters was like.

Indeed, the recruitment boom was so indiscriminate that not a few Air Force veterans today sheepishly admit they were drawn in without realizing that Tom Cruise had actually been flying for the rival service.\n\n(Not everyone was convinced; Roger Ebert was awed by director Tony Scott's ability to depict complex aerial battle maneuvers without overly disorienting the viewer, but added, [\"Look out for the scenes where the people talk to one another.\"](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/top-gun-1986) And the film's absurd horniness was so excessive that it was apparently [blamed for the Tailhook Convention sexual harassment scandal.](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/08/11/top-gun-boosted-recruiting-and-brought-tailhook-scandal-so-what-happens-after-blockbuster-sequel.html))\n\nYears passed.

Otherwise, it will resolve negatively. \n\n[fine-print]\n\n## Study summary\n\nThe original study (N = 462) and the replication study (N = 475) examined whether people assigned a higher probability to another person detecting their lie if they were given information about that other person than if they were not (see the flowchart below). \n\nIn the replication experiment, like in the original study:\nParticipants were asked to write 5 statements about themselves: 4 truths and 1 lie. They were told those statements would be shared with another person, who would then guess which one was the lie. \nParticipants were either given 4 true statements about their \u2018partner\u2019 (Information Condition), or they were given no information about their \u2018partner\u2019 (No Information Condition). \nParticipants were asked to assign a percentage chance describing how likely their \u2018partner\u2019 would be to detect their lie.*\n\n\nOut of 481 participants, 6 were excluded due to missing inputs/data, leaving 475 participants. Participants could not proceed in the experiment if they left any of those statements blank, but there was no automated check on the content of what was submitted. The authors of the original study did not remove any subjects from their analysis, but they recommended to the Clearer Thinking team to do this quality check in the replication.\n\nIn the replication, prior to asking people to give their estimated percentage, participants were reminded that their 'partner' was shown their 5 statements and not told which were true. This was done in case participants had forgotten the conditions of the experiment. In the original study, this reminder had not been provided.\n\nIn the original experiment and in the replication, participants were not actually connected to a \u2018partner.\u2019 Participants in the information condition were randomly given one of two sets of four pre-generated statements designed to be relatively neutral and told that these were four true statements supplied by their \u2018partner.' They were informed about this after all participants had completed the experiment.\n\n\n## Context: How often have social science studies tended to replicate in the past?\n\nIn [one historical project](https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/ws/files/7385883/RPP_SCIENCE_2015.pdf) that attempted to replicate 100 experimental and correlation studies from 2008 in three important psychology journals, [analysis indicated](http://datacolada.org/47) that they successfully replicated 40%, failed to replicate 30%, and the remaining 30% were inconclusive. (To put it another way, of the replications that were not inconclusive, 57% were successful replications.) \n\nIn [another project](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0399-z.epdf), researchers attempted to replicate all experimental social science science papers (that met basic inclusion criteria) published in Nature or Science (the two most prestigious general science journals) between 2010 and 2015. They found a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original study for 62% (i.e., 13 out of 21) studies, and the effect sizes of the replications were, on average, about 50% of the original effect sizes. Replicability varied between 57% and 67% depending on the replicability indicator used.\n\n\n[/fine-print]", "resolution": "no", "fine_print": ""}, {"title": "If Trump is disqualified from holding the presidency, will that disqualification be ruled unconstitutional before January 20, 2025?", "id": 12215, "open_time": "2022-08-13T07:00:00Z", "actual_close_time": "2024-03-04T15:00:00Z", "status": "resolved", "type": "binary", "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if prior to January 20, 2025, the question '[Will any US court rule that Donald J.

BRIAN KOLFAGE, STEPHEN BANNON, ANDREW BADOLATO, and TIMOTHY SHEA, the defendants, and others, orchestrated a scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of donors, including donors in the Southern District of New York, in connection with an online crowdfunding campaign ultimately known as \u201cWe Build The Wall\u201d that raised more than $25,000,000 to build a wall along the southern border of the United States. To induce donors to donate to the campaign, KOLFAGE and BANNON - each of whom, as detailed herein, exerted significant control over We Build the Wall - repeatedly and falsely assured the public that KOLFAGE would \u201cnot take a penny in salary or compensation\u201d and that \u201c100% of the funds raised .. will be used in the execution of our mission and purpose\u201d because, as BANNON publicly stated, \u201cwe\u2019re a volunteer organization.\u201d\n\n>2. Those representations were false. In truth, BRIAN KOLFAGE, STEPHEN BANNON, ANDREW BADOLATO, and TIMOTHY SHEA, the defendants, collectively received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donor funds from We Build the Wall, which they each used in a manner inconsistent with the organization\u2019s public representations. In particular, KOLFAGE covertly took more than $350,000 in funds that had been donated to We Build the Wall for his personal use, while BANNON, through a non-profit organization under his control (\u201cNon-Profit-1\u201d), received over $1,000,000 from We Build the Wall, which BANNON used to, among other things, secretly pay KOLFAGE and to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in BANNON\u2019s personal expenses. To conceal the payments to KOLFAGE from We Build the Wall, KOLFAGE, BANNON, BADOLATO, and SHEA devised a scheme to route those payments from We Build the Wall to KOLFAGE indirectly through Non-Profit-1 and a shell company under SHEA\u2019s control, among other avenues. They did so by using fake invoices and sham \u201cvendor\u201d arrangements, among other ways, to ensure, as KOLFAGE noted in a text message to BADOLATO, that his pay arrangement remained \u201cconfidential\u201d and kept on a \u201cneed to know\u201d basis.\n\n**Will Bannon be found guilty of at least one fraud charge?**\n\n- The resolution concerns the first verdict.

Violent anarchists and Marxists are exploiting protests to transform them into riots and direct assaults on the lives and safety of their fellow Americans,\u201d Cruz told Fox News in an interview.\n\nUnsurprisingly Trump's opponents have opposed this move, and even labelled it impossible. For instance, [in Slate](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/06/antifa-terrorist-organization-designation-trump.html), we can read:\n\n>While the president and attorney general may have political motivations for wanting to stigmatize a left-wing movement by tagging it with the terrorist label and thus seek to assign blame for the violence engulfing several U.S. major cities, it is unlikely that Trump can do so within existing legal authorities.\n\n>In the United States, there are two competent authorities for designating terrorist groups. First, the Department of State can designate groups as Foreign Terrorist Organizations pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act. It can also designate both groups and individuals as terrorists under Executive Order 13224. This order was established shortly after Sept. 11 as part of an effort to provide the State and Treasury departments enhanced capability to block terrorists from the U.S. formal financial system.\n\n>However, for the State Department to designate a group, it must document that the organization operates overseas, and that the group\u2019s leaders, camps, and operations are based outside of the continental United States. Antifa, by virtue of its domestic presence and lack of any organizational cohesion, would be impossible for the State Department to designate.\n\n>The Treasury Department can also sanction terrorists per Executive Order 13224. But it can only piggy-back on an already existing designation of a group, typically one that is already labeled by the State Department as a terrorist organization. Without an underlying State Department designation, the Treasury Department can\u2019t act. And, while Treasury has designated a number of domestic-based charities as terrorist entities, those groups were linked to foreign organizations such as Hamas, the Tamil Tigers, Lebanese Hizballah, and al-Qaida.\n\nSo it appears to be difficult for the Trump administration to accomplish this. Thus, the question is: \n\n**Will Antifa officially be labelled a terrorist organization in the US before 2022?**\n\n- Antifa must be added to an official list of terrorist organizations for this to resolve positively.

A few days ago, officials admitted that certain \u201cperipheral\u201d structures of the massive Three Gorges Dam deformed due to the building water pressure. Stunning pictures of water being released to relieve pressure are raising the specter of whether the entire dam could fail (some good photos here). Some online satellite photos purporting to show the buckling of the dam, however, should be viewed with skepticism.\n\n> Still, the damage that has already occurred from the record deluge is significant, with numerous cities upriver from the dam already flooded[...]\n\n> All that would be dwarfed if the Three Gorges Dam failed. The dam was built from 1994 to 2006, at a cost of $31 billion and displacing 1.4 million people for its construction, precisely to lessen the risk of devastating flooding along the Yangtze, a perennial problem in China since ancient times. The river\u2019s basin accounts for nearly half of China\u2019s agricultural output, and it runs through major cities, such as Wuhan, with 10 million people.\n\n\n> Chinese authorities have already evacuated 38 million people downriver. The dam can hold back waters to a level of 175 meters above sea level; according to the Bureau of Hydrology of the Chanjiang (Yangtze) Water Resources Commission, the latest (Friday) height at the dam was 158.85 meters, down from 164 meters on Tuesday. Yet more rain is predicted, and if smaller, older dams upriver from Three Gorges overflow or fail, then the pressure on the main dam could quickly overwhelm either its capacity or even its structural integrity.\n\n> While an outright failure of the dam may not be the primary danger, nonetheless its geopolitical consequences are staggering to contemplate. It would be a black swan of epic proportions, China\u2019s Chernobyl moment.

Notably, protesters who throw rocks, water bottles, or other debris at law enforcement, or who start fires, are considered \"unarmed\". Protesters who use vehicles which require a license to operate as weapons will be considered \"armed\" (e.g. if a protester intentionally drives their car into a crowd). If protesters use weapons which do not fit into the above described categories, they are considered \"armed\" only if moderators consider using live ammunition to be a proportionate response. (E.g. if a protester attacked law enforcement with a machete, live ammunition may be a proportionate response, but not if they attack with pepper spray.)\n2. If law enforcement is firing upon armed protesters, and unarmed protesters are caught in the crossfire, that would not satisfy this question.\n3. Law enforcement must use live ammunition for the purpose of this question. If a protester is killed using \"less than lethal\" ammunition (e.g. rubber bullets), that would not satisfy. \n4. Law enforcement must intentionally fire at protesters. Accidental discharge or a \"warning shot\" which does not injure anyone do not satisfy this question.\n5. If facts are disputed, the standard of evidence shall be one which would consider the Kent and Jackson State killings to satisfy this question. (E.g. if there are credible investigations which conclude that the protesters were unarmed, then that event would satisfy this question, even if other reports claim that protesters were armed, and the standard of evidence is not strong enough to press legal charges). Moderators will determine whether an investigation is \"credible\".\n6. A protestor is a person who is participating in an organized public demonstration of disapproval.

Grant, who sought to serve a third term in 1880, though that was eleven years *after* he had left the oval office. A more serious case was Theodore Roosevelt. President William McKinley was assassinated still in the first year of his second term and Vice President Roosevelt had to take over. He forewent a consecutive third term, since he felt term limits were a good check on dictatorships, being succeeded by William H. Taft. But due to his dissatisfaction with President Taft\u2019s political acumen Roosevelt sought a third term for the 1912 election, heading the Progressive Party, thus once more straining the traditional two term limits, but due to his defeat at the hands of Woodrow Wilson the tradition remained true.\n\nCalvin Coolidge, following the sudden death of his predecessor Warren G.

Roosevelt took over the helm was the tradition broken. Buoyed by his success in dealing with the Great Depression and trusting only his own political experience in dealing with the Nazis currently sweeping through Western Europe, he sought and won a third term in 1940. Despite being aware of his ailing health, he also sought and won a fourth consecutive term, but considered resigning once the war was over. Three months into his fourth term his health declined rapidly and he died, making place for his Vice President Harry S. Truman.\n\nTruman took office the remaining almost full term and was reelected in 1948. In 1951 the 22nd Amendment was ratified, which would have rendered him ineligible for the 1952 election, were it not for the grandfather clause.

[T]he public outcry against even high single-digit inflation will be deafening.  Historically, governments have a standard response to such outcries: economy-wide price controls.

A gene drive in a particular allele shows up as a bias for the corresponding phenotype in the offspring. Consider two parents with different alleles for the same gene; if there exists a gene drive for one allele, it is highly likely that all of the parents' offspring will carry the driven gene's trait. \n\nWith new advances in genetic engineering using CRISPR, it is now much easier to modify an organism's genes. This makes *engineered* gene drives [tractable]: a gene coding for the CRISPR system itself can be encoded near to the gene being \"driven,\" so that if one copy of the driven allele and one \"wild\" allele are inherited, the CRISPR system modifies the wild gene so that the driven gene plus CRISPR system is inherited.  This process can spread the driven gene exponentially throughout a population, at a rate far exceeding the spread of a gene that is merely favorable for survival.\n\nUses of this method include the potential to eliminate diseases like malaria or lyme disease that are spread by a fast-reproducing vector, by promoting disease-resistant traits. [Valentino Gantz et. al.] have genetically altered a primary malaria vector native to India, the [Anopheles stephensi] mosquito, to carry and pass on anti-malaria traits. Another [study] published in nature biotechnology offers a more drastic approach that would render female [Anopheles gambiae] mosquitoes, native to Africa, completely infertile, with the intent of wiping out the species in affected ecosystems. Similar studies have investigated [engineering mice] (a prime carrier) to be immune to Lyme disease. \n\nWith Malaria [afflicting hundreds of millions] of people per year, advances in gene drive research have instigated public conversations about the usefulness, feasibility, and ethics of gene drives being encouraged before testing them in wild ecosystems.\n\n**In the year 2020, will no gene drive be launched to fight malaria-carrying mosquitoes in any part of the world?**\n\nFor negative resolution, there must be credible reports that the drive was initiated.

Some new notable cases have been made that Chinese GDP growth in recent years has been exaggerated. From March 7th 2019, see this [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-08/china-s-gdp-growth-pace-was-inflated-for-nine-years-study-finds), and a similar take by the [South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2189052/china-exaggerated-gdp-data-2-percentage-points-least-nine).  They cite [this paper](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/BPEA-2019-Forensic-Analysis-China.pdf) by the Brookings Institute, which describes an escalating discrepancy between provincially-reported numbers and nationally-reported numbers.\n\nSeparately, US economist Michael Pettis of Peking University says that Chinese gross domestic product is overestimated since [\"bad debt is not written down\"](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2189245/chinas-gdp-growth-could-be-half-reported-number-says-us).  That's another SCMP article, March 10th 2019.\n\nNote that there have been papers and arguments to the contrary.  For instance [this paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23323) arguing that it may be understated based on nighttime satellite luminosity measures.  Later in that same year (2017) the exact opposite was argued in [this paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3093296) (also using nighttime luminosity data); that China's growth has been exaggerated, and even that this finding generalizes to authoritarian regimes.\n\nThere was also that moment back in 2010 when [Li Keqiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Keqiang) reportedly [stated explicitly](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-wikileaks/chinas-gdp-is-man-made-unreliable-top-leader-idUSTRE6B527D20101206) that \"China\u2019s GDP figures are man-made and therefore unreliable\".  Li Keqiang has since become the 7th Premier of the People's Republic of China and currently still in office as of this writing.\n\n**Thus, it is asked: will real (inflation-adjusted) Chinese GDP numbers be revised down by more than 5%, to undo the prior exaggeration?**\n\nFor resolution, there are a couple of different scenarios to consider:\n\n1.  Already-reported official figures in recent years being revised down by 5% or lower by the Chinese government.  For example: 2018's end-of-year figure of $13.4 trillion USD having a newly-reported figure of $12.73 trillion USD or less.  The reduction would naturally also apply to future real GDP figures (such as for 2019), but I think for the purposes of this question we will permit future exaggerations to their real GDP growth rate; a one-time reduction counts as positive resolution.\n\n2.  Alternatively, if the Chinese government does not explicitly revise its past data for continuity and simply posts the (hopefully more accurate) new figure for 2019 under a separate method, then we would consider it positive resolution IF for instance the figure for 2019 real GDP failed to grow beyond 2018's (formerly-claimed) figure of $13.4 trillion USD.  This is roughly similar to a revision to 2018 of 5% or more, as the official real GDP growth target for 2019 is 6% to 6.5%.  In order to distinguish this event from a recession, we will look to official statements that would presumably be included to clarify the drop in real GDP.  If for some weird reason this kind of official statement is not included, then we could use other indications to confirm if it's a recession (such as recessions happening elsewhere, or the [Purchasing Manager's Index](https://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey/Page.mvc/PressReleases)).  There will likely be some sort of statement made about the revision if there is one so I don't think this will be ambiguous, but distinguishing the revision from a recession given no official statement is a weakly defined part of the question, so feel free to scrutinize.\n\nFor future inflation adjustments, we will be using 2018 as the price level base year.\n\nThis resolves negatively if neither 1 nor 2 happen before January 1st, 2023.  Resolves positively if either of those two are deemed to have occurred.  Resolution will be based on media reports by reputable financial institutions, by a report from the Chinese government, or by this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_GDP_of_China#China_NBS_data).\n\nIn order to immortalize the already-reported figures with which to make comparisons to future reported figures, I have download data from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=CN) and preserved the currently official figures in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NRPU368_gQMl5x4oHTTbmpPQPh5248AmXTv9JjuTai4/edit?usp=sharing).", "resolution": "no", "fine_print": ""}, {"title": "Will World GDP grow every year until 2025?", "id": 2669, "open_time": "2019-03-28T00:00:00Z", "actual_close_time": "2021-03-24T23:00:00Z", "status": "resolved", "type": "binary", "resolution_criteria": "The 2008 financial crisis was [\"considered by many economists to have been the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008).\n\nAccording to the World Bank (series ID: [NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?end=2017&start=1961&view=chart)), 2009 was the only year since 1961 when the World GDP did not grow (it shrunk by 1.7%).\n\nQuestion: **Will the World GDP grow for each of the next 6 years (2019-2024)?**\n\nEstimates from the World Bank or  some other reputable source shall serve for resolution.

It\u2019s also important to have a sense of how noisy the trend is. I looked at\u00a0[this data from NASA](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt)\u00a0to see how I would have done making this prediction every year from 2002 to the present.

I envision this technology becoming a platform that can be used by Blizzard and independent modders for many applications. \n\nOne example is a neural network that not only plays the game, but does so by simulating human hands, a mouse, and a keyboard in order to represent human play as faithfully as possible. But in the short term, this could also be acheived by simply constraining Alphastar to mimic the human keystroke and mouse movement data that it already has access to. Right now the AI plays the game in ways that are probably impossible for humans to reproduce, but a properly constrained AI could discover the theoretical optimal strategies and meta for humans, which the player community could then learn from. \n\nSuch accurately representative simulations would also make it possible to design a more perfectly balanced version of the game, as well as reliably dictate a meta that encourages desired play styles. This could be done for the professional scene in particular, but also for all other levels of player proficiency. \n\nIt could perhaps be possible to create AIs on demand that play in various predefined styles, e.g. mimic individual human players, or play at a skill level so accurately defined that it can serve as the new benchmark for player rankings and leagues. Or it could do all of these at once, eventually. It could be possible to use insights from the AI's self assessment mechanisms to design a customizeable training \"coach\" for players. Alphastar is already made to calculate a win/loss prediction, continuously updating in response to the gamestate (see in linked article). I'm sure players would love to see graphs of win/loss prediction for their games.\n\nDo you think that AI will be applied in these ways to SC2 in the future? Do you think this will invigorate the player community, and introduce new possibilities, to such a degree that this incentivizes Blizzard to announce new content in 2021?\n\nThis question asks:\n\n**In 2021, will Blizzard announce new content for StarCraft as a response to advances in AI?**\n \nNew content means: \n\n1) A new game, which would be a third installment (and which may be something Blizzard is already considering, regardless of AI), but is not really necessary considering SC2's remaining popularity.\n\n2) An expansion pack for StarCraft 2, which would be the third, or even StarCraft, which would be second.\n\n3) Or a patch that is not as big as an expansion, but is unprecedented in scale and scope relative to all previous patches. This means it has to be something more than and distinct from:\n\n    -new skins,\n    -new maps,\n    -or more balance patches,\n\nall three of which occur pretty routinely.\n\nNew contents must be announced in the form of an official Blizzard press release. (Or, in the unlikely event of the IP getting sold, whoever owns StarCraft). For new content to count as a \"response\" to AI, the press release or marketing for the game must mention AI, neural networks, Alphastar, either as having motivated the change, or been involved in the development of the content in some way.", "resolution": "no", "fine_print": ""}, {"title": "Will the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit $30,000 before it hits $20,000?", "id": 2603, "open_time": "2019-02-02T08:00:00Z", "actual_close_time": "2019-04-30T23:00:00Z", "status": "resolved", "type": "binary", "resolution_criteria": "A follow-up to [this question.](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1670/what-number-will-the-dow-jones-industrial-average-hit-first-20000-or-25000/.)\n\nAs of the close of trading on 30 January 2019, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) sat at 25,014.86.\n\nThe DJIA is a stock market index that indicates the value of 30 large, publicly owned companies based in the United States, and how they have traded in the stock market during various periods of time.

It seems that AncestryDNA [owns 'licenses' over the genetic data of the individuals who sign up to the service](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ancestry-dna-steal-own/), and the individuals themselves maintain ownership over their own genetic data. For this reason, it's hard to predict precisely what language they will use to describe the number of people 'in their database'. Fortunately, the precise verb they use in relation to the number of individuals will probably not lead to contestable ambiguity in the question resolution. But with regards to the matter of 'kits sold', see below:\n\n* The statement used to confirm positive resolution should ideally be focused on the number of *people*; if the statement mentions instead the *number of kits sold*, and it is not unambiguously clear that the same number of people have been 'tested' by AncestryDNA or that their genetic information is 'in the database', or similar language indicating that they have actually generated the digitised genetic data of this number of people, then the statement cannot be used for positive resolution, unless the community consensus decides otherwise, for instance due to the statement's context\n\n* In the event that Ancestry.com in some way 'acquires' another genetic database, and the new number of individuals 'in AncestryDNA's database' goes above 20 million, the question resolves positive only if these new individuals are somehow integrated into the system, for instance such that these new individuals are searchable in AncestryDNA's genetic relative\u2013finding service\n\n* If Ancestry.com starts offering a service which [allows people to upload onto their site](https://support.ancestry.com/s/question/0D515000027ncX3CAI/uploading-raw-data-from-23andme-to-ancestrycom) genetic data generated from other sources, in the manner of [other services like MyHeritage](https://www.myheritage.com/dna/upload), any statement used to support positive resolution must convey unambiguously that the number mentioned is the number of individuals whose digitised genetic data was generated by, from DNA samples gathered by, Ancestry.com, its subsidiaries, or registered contractors", "resolution": "no", "fine_print": ""}, {"title": "Will Fulham be relegated from the English Premier League?", "id": 1609, "open_time": "2018-12-04T08:00:00Z", "actual_close_time": "2019-03-01T00:59:00Z", "status": "resolved", "type": "binary", "resolution_criteria": "This year, [Fulham F.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.) was promoted to the Premier League, the top tier of the English football league system.\n\nIt's not going well for them so far.

You need more than three victims in order for such a designation to make sense.  Note that we immediately moved from mass killings to mass shootings, because gun violence is just that common in America.  \n\nPerhaps with more data on gun violence in American society we could have a more reasonable definition. This raises another contentious issue in this debate, how do we track the number of shootings?  Who is the authority on this data?\nYou might think that the Center for Disease Control and Prevention should have a significant role in monitoring gun violence since many people consider this a public health issue. After all, their motto is [\u201cCDC 24/7. Saving lives. Protecting people.\u201d](https://www.cdc.gov/)\nLest ye forget, this is America:\n>In 1996, the Republican-majority Congress threatened to strip funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention unless it stopped funding research into firearm injuries and deaths. The National Rifle Association accused the CDC of promoting gun control. As a result, the CDC stopped funding gun-control research \u2014 which had a chilling effect far beyond the agency, drying up money for almost all public health studies of the issue nationwide.

Fortunately, we can table this issue and proceed with our forecasting.  \n\nFor the purposes of this question we will consider mass shootings with 20 casualties. By casualty we are referring to an individual that is killed or injured during the shooting (and yes, this includes the shooter).  This makes for a more interesting question. Note that the [recent Jacksonville shooting](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/27/us/jacksonville-madden-tournament-shooting/index.html) would not meet the threshold set forth here.  \n\nMass shootings, as defined earlier, have become a commonplace event in this American life. The FBI provides reliable data about \u2018active shooters\u2019.  [According to the FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/active-shooter-incidents-us-2016-2017.pdf/view), the US endured 20 mass killings in 2016 and 2017.  Mass shooting involving more than 20 casualties are rarer.  Thus far, we have only had one such event in 2018.  The [Stoneman Douglas High School shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoneman_Douglas_High_School_shooting) claimed 17 lives and included 17 injuries. \n\nIn 2017, we had two such events.  The [Las Vegas Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_shooting) in Las Vegas on October 1, 2017 in which 58 people were killed and 289 wounded.  Also, the [Sutherland Springs church shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland_Springs_church_shooting) on November 5, 2017 in which  27 people were killed (including the shooter and an unborn child) and 20 wounded. \n\nDespite the previously mentioned controversy concerning obtaining reliable data about gun violence once we increase the threshold to include 20 casualties it becomes readily apparent how we will resolve our question. A mass shooting with 20 or more casualties will be all over every media site in the hours following such a horrific event.

The great scientific interest in the phenomenon as well as its practical utility has motivated extensive efforts  to discover and understand new superconductors. We report the observation of superconductivity at ambient temperature and pressure conditions in films and pellets of a nanostructured material that is composed of silver particles embedded into a gold matrix. Specifically, we observe that upon cooling below 236K at ambient pressures, the resistance of  sample films drops below 0-4 Ohm, being limited by instrument sensitivity.  Further, below the  transition temperature, samples become strongly diamagnetic, with volume susceptibilities as  low  as -0.056. We further describe methods to tune the transition to temperatures higher than room temperature.

[The plot thickens.](https://www.wired.com/story/the-curious-case-of-a-revolutionary-but-imaginary-superconductor/?__twitter_impression=true&mbid=social_twitter)  Brian Skinner, an MIT researcher, ran a analysis of the data in Thapa\u2019s and Pandey\u2019s article. \n>The graph plots a material\u2019s magnetic susceptibility - the degree at which the material becomes magnetized after a magnetic field is applied - at a given temperature. The jump up in magnetic susceptibility is when the material is approaching its critical temperature to become superconductive.\nSkinner noticed that the pattern of green and blue data plots are pretty much exact copies of each other only shifted down by a constant amount. He consulted other physicists at MIT and elsewhere to see if they had encountered anything like it in their experiments. But all of them were very baffled by it and could think of no obvious explanation for it.\n\nThis reminded many scientists of the [Schon scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6n_scandal), including Pratap Raychaudhuri, a professor at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in India .

Bernier's acrimonious departure came after the Conservative Party caucus \u2014 mostly notably leader Andrew Scheer, [who beat Bernier by two percentage points during a 2017 leadership race](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/05/27/maxime-bernier-leads-tory-leadership-race-after-first-ballot-andrew-scheer-second.html) \u2014 [distanced themselves from him](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-bernier-caucus-scheer-1.4795623) in the wake of blowback to his comments addressing what he called the ruling Liberal party's policies of \"extreme diversity\".\n\nBernier has [declared his intentions to form his own federal political party and field candidates in all 338 of Canada's federal ridings](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/maxime-bernier-why-my-new-political-movement-because-canada-has-been-hijacked). He enjoys considerable grassroots support. A poll of a thousand Canadians shortly after he announced his intention to form a party found [13% of Canadians intended to cast their vote for its candidates](http://abacusdata.ca/will-max-bernier-be-a-spoiler-for-the-conservative-party/). While this is an impressive start, it's clear that Bernier has an uphill battle ahead of him in order to ascend to the Prime Ministership, or even to the Leader of the Official Opposition, a position currently occupied by his formal rival Scheer. \n\nOne big boost to Bernier's candidacy would be an endorsement from Canadian intellectual Jordan Peterson, [who is arguably the most well-known and popular intellectual in the Western world today](https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2018/03/16/jordan-peterson-is-trying-to-make-sense-of-the-world-including-his-own-strange-journey.html). His work \u2014 which is often articulated in bombastic popular lectures \u2014 covers topics such as free speech, identity, anti-totalitarianism, personality, performance, and religion, among many others. Peterson's reach is considerable: his lectures have been viewed nearly 70 million times on YouTube, and his new book, 12 Rules for Life, has sold over half a million copies. \n\nPeterson and Bernier have crossed paths before. Bernier cited a meeting with Jordan Peterson has having [changed his mind on endorsing Bill C-16](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-leadership-maxime-bernier-c-16-gender-1.3981691), which amends the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code to include the terms \"gender identity\" and \"gender expression\". [He met Peterson again and was photographed with him this past April at an event in Montreal](https://twitter.com/maximebernier/status/989970810679984128?lang=en), where he says the two of them spoke on the topic of freedom of speech. \n\n[Peterson considers himself to be a \"classical liberal\"](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/jordan-peterson-claims-hes-no-conservative/), while Maxime resists political labelling but has suggested he himself might [reasonably be called a freedom-loving fiscal conservative, or a \"reasonable libertarian\"](https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/breakfast-with-bernier-1.3931417). Both share a dislike for the policies and perspectives of the current Prime Minster, Justin Trudeau, and his Liberal Party. \n\nWhile there is perhaps not much political space between Bernier and Peterson, its not clear that Peterson is in the business of offering political endorsements. He seems not to have made any publicly during the 2015 Canadian federal election. He did say, when asked, that he would be [open to endorsing candidate Tanya Granic Allen during the Ontario Progressive Conservative party's leadership race earlier this year](https://www.pressreader.com/canada/ottawa-citizen/20180301/281621010832293), but no such endorsement ever came.

From: [How three conspiracy theorists took 'Q' and sparked Qanon](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/how-three-conspiracy-theorists-took-q-sparked-qanon-n900531) (_names added_)\n\nWho is Coleman Rogers and why would anyone think that he is part of QAnon? \n>A review of Rogers\u2019 Facebook page shows he had been active in internet politics and a staunch supporter of Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign, self-identifying as part of the \u201cmeme war\u201d \u2014 the creation and dissemination of images and internet-style commentary that internet agitators on the chans and Reddit credit with Trump\u2019s win. Rogers often posted memes about \u201cliberal tears\u201d as well as the ludicrous claims that Democrats murdered children and worshipped Satan \u2014 details similar to those that would eventually form the Qanon theory. (ibid)\n\nSo he has a history of spreading absurd lies on the interwebs.  What else? \n>Within a month (_of being kicked off Reddit_), Rogers, 31, and his wife, Christina Urso, 29, had launched the Patriots\u2019 Soapbox, a round-the-clock livestreamed YouTube channel for Qanon study and discussion. The channel is, in effect, a broadcast of a Discord chatroom with constant audio commentary from a rotating cast of volunteers and moderators with sporadic appearances by Rogers and Urso. In April, Urso registered Patriots\u2019 Soapbox LLC in Virginia. Rogers and Urso use their channel to call for donations that are accepted through PayPal, cryptocurrencies or mail.\u201d( _parenthetical added_ ibid)\n\nPerhaps they are merely profiting off of this cultural phenomenon.  However, some believe that Rogers really is Q.\n>Some YouTube channels, like one named Unirock, are mostly dedicated to poring over Patriots\u2019 Soapbox livestreams and dissecting purported slip-ups.

Otherwise this could be difficult to resolve.  If Rogers has been perpetuating the myth of Q in order to make money then he wouldn't be terribly likely to be forthright about it.  Given that difficulty, this question will use consensus forming to create its own answer on whether Rogers is indeed Q (individually, or as a member of a team).

A gene drive in a particular allele shows up as a bias for the corresponding phenotype in the offspring. Consider two parents with different alleles for the same gene; if there exists a gene drive for one allele, it is highly likely that all of the parents' offspring will carry the driven gene's trait. \n\nWith new advances in genetic engineering using CRISPR, it is now much easier to modify an organism's genes. This makes *engineered* gene drives [tractable]: a gene coding for the CRISPR system itself can be encoded near to the gene being \"driven,\" so that if one copy of the driven allele and one \"wild\" allele are inherited, the CRISPR system modifies the wild gene so that the driven gene plus CRISPR system is inherited.  This process can spread the driven gene expoentially throughout a population, at a rate far exceeding the spread of a gene that is merely favorable for survival.\n\nUses of this method include the potential to eliminate diseases like malaria or lyme disease that are spread by a fast-reproducing vector, by promoting disease-resistant traits. [Valentino Gantz et. al.] have genetically altered a primary malaria vector native to India, the [Anopheles stephensi] mosquito, to carry and pass on anti-malaria traits.

After a fusion reaction occurs, the responsible muon is free to catalyze further events until it either decays (its rest frame half-life is two microseconds) or is removed from action by \"sticking\" to an alpha particle produced by the fusion. Economic viability of the process for creating energy would require that a single muon catalyze approximately 500 fusion events before it decays, a rate of efficiency that exceeds best efforts by at least a factor of two or three.\n\nMuon-catalyzed fusion was originally observed in laboratory experiments and described in [this article](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.105.1127) by Luis Alvarez et al., and was studied in depth by John David Jackson, he of Jackson's [*Electrodynamics*](https://www.amazon.com/Classical-Electrodynamics-Third-David-Jackson/dp/047130932X) fame. Jackson's [1957 Physical Review article](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.106.330) is a standard reference, and remarkably, more than a half-century later, he summarized the history of the field in this [2010 review](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00016-009-0006-9).\n\nThe prospects for muon-catalyzed fusion as an energy source seemed moderately bright during the 1980s and 1990s, following the elucidation and observation of [molecular states of the deuterium-tritium-muon positive ion](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1967JETPL...5...91V). The field has largely stalled in recent years, however, as workable schemes for either producing muons more cheaply, or improving their catalytic efficiency have failed to emerge.\n\nAt the close of the 2010 article, Jackson seemed optimistic, writing, \"The effort for such a specialized field has been prodigious, especially in the last 30 years. On the applied side, ideas continue on how to increase the number of fusions per muon and design hybrid systems to get into the realm of net energy production.\" Certainly, it is fair to state that development of effective muon-catalyzed fusion for energy production would be a global game changer.\n\nPrior to Jan 1, 2020, will a peer-reviewed article appear in the mainstream physics literature which discusses a discovery of a physical phenomenon or which outlines an engineering technique that can either (1) increase the number of deuterium-tritium fusions per muon, or (2) decrease the energy cost of muon production to the point where a break-even reactor is feasible?", "resolution": "yes", "fine_print": ""}, {"title": "Will the upcoming \"Last Jedi\" augmented reality game be a success?", "id": 527, "open_time": "2017-08-28T03:00:00Z", "actual_close_time": "2017-09-12T07:00:00Z", "status": "resolved", "type": "binary", "resolution_criteria": "Pokemon Go was the first highly-successful augmented reality (AR) game, being downloaded [more than 500 millions times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok\u00e9mon_Go).

Less than 20 hours later, a cloud of hot plasma ejected by the flare slammed into Earth's magnetosphere. Auroras were visible down to tropical latitudes, and telegraphs failed in spectacular fashion, reportedly delivering electric shocks to their operators. As discussed in a [previous question](http://www.metaculus.com/questions/168/will-the-us-develop-a-new-satellite-for-early-warning-of-severe-geomagnetic-storms/), solar storms have the potential to impact power and communications systems, and storms at or above the Carrington level would have devastating effects. [A 2013 assessment by Lloyd's](https://www.lloyds.com/news-and-insight/risk-insight/library/natural-environment/solar-storm) estimates that if such an event were to occur today, damages to the US economy alone would range from 0.6 to 2.6 trillion dollars.\n\n[Solar flares](http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/sftheory/flare.htm) occur in association with magnetic field reconnection near the Sun's surface, and are most frequent during the active period of the solar cycle. \nThe occurrence rate of solar storm energies follows a relatively well-defined power-law distribution, and the Carrington event was estimated to have had energy ~ \\(10^{32}\\) erg. The frequency of trans-Carrington storms, however, depends on how far the distribution extends, which is unknown.  \n\nSome constraint comes from geological records.  Evidence from an overabundance of radioactive 14C detected in tree rings suggests the Sun [might have produced a small \"superflare\" in AD 775 and again in AD 993,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superflare)  although [alternate explanations](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v486/n7402/full/nature11123.html) for the anomalies are also viable.\n\nAdditional insight is gained by monitoring of the flares of nearby stars. Researchers using the LAMOST telescope [have reported](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160324/ncomms11058/full/ncomms11058.html) regular eruptions 10,000 times larger than the Carrington event on other stars. The team showed that these superflares are likely formed via the same mechanism as solar flares, and unexpectedly, they found ~10% of the superflaring stars have magnetic fields either comparable to or weaker than the Sun's, implicitly raising the possibility that our Sun could go amok with a massive flare.\n\nSuperflaring stars generally have short rotation periods (which generate higher levels of magnetic activity), but stars with rotation as slow as the Sun can apparently also produce superflares. [A study published in Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7399/full/nature11063.html) showed a total of 187 superflares on 23 solar-type stars (5600-6000 K, rotational period > 10 d) having energies in the \\(10^{32}-10^{36}\\) erg range. A consideration of theoretical estimates in conjunction with the observations generated a [published hypothesis](http://pasj.oxfordjournals.org/content/65/3/49.full.pdf+html) that superflares of \\(10^{34}\\)  erg occur once in ~800 yr on our present Sun. \n\n[An analysis of Kepler photometry](https://www.kwasan.kyoto-u.ac.jp/hinode-7/files/hinode7_14s6i01_Maehara.pdf) showed that superflares on solar-type stars (with rotational periods greater than 10 days) exhibit similar occurrence frequency distribution of those for solar flares. The analysis suggests, however, that all superflaring stars have starspot complexes substantially larger than those presently  occurring during solar maxima. \n\nA reasonable summary of the current evidence suggests that the Sun can produce flares up to ~1000x the strength of the Carrington event, but such flares would require sunspot activity at levels substantially larger than those seen in the historical record. Given the stakes, it would be nice to have a better handle on the odds.\n\n**By July 2018, will additional significant evidence emerge suggesting that our Sun experiences \\(10^{34}\\) erg or larger flares on a time scale shorter than 1000 years?**\n\nPositive resolution requires a paper in the peer-reviewed literature by July 2018 in which a \"most likely\" or \"fiducial\" estimate of solar flares with energy \\(10^{34}\\) erg exceeds 1 per 1000 years.

[Paul Marik](https://www.evms.edu/education/centers_institutes_departments/internal_medicine/faculty_staff/pulmonary__critical_care_faculty/name_11909_en.html), a doctor in Norfolk, VA developing a new sepsis treatment, says the death rate from the infection is akin to \"[three jumbo jets crashing every day](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/23/521096488/doctor-turns-up-possible-treatment-for-deadly-sepsis).\"\n\nCurrently, hospitals treat sepsis by administering fluids and antibiotics. Marik's treatment involves a mix of corticosteroids and two vitamins - Vitamin B and Vitamin C. The combination, Marik says, boosts the body's reception of the steroids,which relieve the inflammation associated with sepsis. Marik [says he's treated 150 patients with his custom combo now](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/23/521096488/doctor-turns-up-possible-treatment-for-deadly-sepsis), and only one has died of sepsis.\n\nMarik's treatment seems miraculous and potentially transformative in the way sepsis is treated - so naturally and rightfully, physicians are wary. A chief concern is that the treatment hasn't been through a [randomized double-blind controlled trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial), the gold standard of evaluating medical treatments. In such a trial, patients are randomly assigned to receive either the treatment or a placebo, with neither the patient or the doctor aware of who receives what. One physician [stated](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/30/521918863/why-the-newly-proposed-sepsis-treatment-needs-more-study) that with the claims Marik has made, even a small study could corroborate them. Ideally, such a study would be carried out at multiple hospitals to ensure the effect could be replicated.\n\nPart of doctors' skepticism comes from the history of sepsis treatments. In 2011, [two potential treatments](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/1104740) failed due to a lack of clear evidence that they were effective. Both were pharmaceuticals, which proceed through a different approval pathway than Marik's treatment, which does not involve any new drugs, but rather a combination of existing compounds.  Marik will have to submit a research proposal for funding, with a review process that could take nine months. Results wouldn't be available for probably two years.\n\nBut if the treatment is proven effective, it could save millions of lives and reshape medicine's understanding of how the body responds to inflammation.\n\n***Will a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial of Marik's treatment begin before 2019?***\n\n*This question will resolve as positive if a clinical trial registry such as clinicaltrials.gov or a credible news outlet reports that a trial treatment for sepsis involving corticosteroids and vitamins C and D is underway on or before December 31, 2018.*", "resolution": "yes", "fine_print": ""}, {"title": "LISA chosen by ESA to move forward?", "id": 460, "open_time": "2017-04-19T12:45:18Z", "actual_close_time": "2017-05-15T00:00:00Z", "status": "resolved", "type": "binary", "resolution_criteria": "The February 2016 [detection of gravitational waves](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160211) by the earth-bound LIGO observatory heralded the beginning of gravitational-wave astronomy. Much as other forms of astronomy collect information by observing visible light, infrared, or x-rays, gravitational-wave astronomy observes the universe via the ripples in space-time that emanate from cosmic events, such as the collision of black holes. \n\nIn response to the newfound interest in gravitational waves, the European Space Agency [chose \"The Gravitational Universe\" as the theme](http://sci.esa.int/cosmic-vision/58543-the-gravitational-universe/) for its L3 mission, slated for a 2034 launch. ESA's [call for mission proposals](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/2016-l3-mission-call) closed in January 2017. \n\nOne of the proposals submitted is for the [Laser Interferometer Space Antenna](https://www.lisamission.org) (LISA), a mission that would comprise three spacecraft, arranged in a triangle. As gravitational waves pass by the antenna, the ripples in gravity will change the distance between the points in a manner detectable by the primary spacecraft. The distance between the spacecraft is large \u2013 ten times larger than the orbit of the moon. \n\nTechnology for this proposed mission was proven on a [test mission](http://www.nature.com/news/successful-test-drive-for-space-based-gravitational-wave-detector-1.19452), LISA Pathfinder, which launched in 2015.

The mission was first proposed to the ESA in the 1990s and gained additional traction with the participation of NASA, promised in 1997. NASA withdrew in 2011, however, citing budget cuts. ESA then asked the proposed L1 missions, including LISA, to reformulate lower-cost versions.

LIGO's discovery prompted a resurgent interest in gravitational wave astronomy and led to the ESA's mission theme. At the same time, LISA Pathfinder had returned successful results, proving out the mission's technology. Finally, NASA [rejoined the project](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/nasa-moves-rejoin-sped-gravitational-wave-mission), although as a junior partner.

A layer of ozone sits about 6 miles above the earth, in the stratosphere, and protects earth from harmful wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation. Ozone reacts very easily with other chemicals, however. Chlorine and bromine can knock an oxygen atom off of an ozone molecule, leaving an oxygen atom that cannot perform the same protective function as ozone. \n\nChloroflurocarbons, chemicals used in refrigeration, are particularly effective in destroying ozone molecules. After a seasonal hole in the ozone layer was first discovered in 1985, however, international cooperation yielded an agreement in 1987 to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals.

Dirigibles. Zeppelins. Airships have been around since the 1900s, but they have struggled to find their niche among faster, smaller, and safer aircraft. Early zeppelin pioneers envisioned airships filling the skies as a major form of transportation, and the Empire State Building was even [designed to accommodate](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/realestate/26scapes.html?_r=0) them but the [1937 Hindenburg disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindenburg_disaster) quashed that dream. (Seemingly every movie ever envisioning an alternative timeline for the US has zeppelins all over!)\n\nAirships haven't died out completely, though. The [Goodyear blimp](http://www.goodyearblimp.com/) is one popular example. (Terminology note: A [blimp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blimp) is an airship with a non-rigid envelope, supported only by the pressure of the enclosed lighter-than-air gas. Semi-rigid or rigid envelope frames are called [Zeppelins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeppelin).) \n\nSince 2006, [Lockheed Martin](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/) has been developing a semi-rigid airship called the [LMH-1](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/HybridAirship.html). The three-lobed airship, filled with helium, is designed as a cargo ship that can deliver up to 47,000 pounds of cargo and 19 passengers to any place in the world without a need for paved roads or a landing runway. Today, such sites are typically accessed by helicopter. But the LMH-1's operating cost is estimated as 7-10 times less than a helicopter. The airship promises access to the two-thirds of the earth's land area inaccessible by paved roads.\n\nLockheed Martin's target markets for the LMH-1 are the oil, gas, and mining industries. Mine and well sites can be located in remote areas, and companies must either build the costly and environmentally damaging infrastructure to access the sites, or deliver people and materials by helicopter. Airships provide a cheaper alternative. All they need is a 2,400 foot landing area, less than half a mile long. Using an air cushion landing system, the LMH-1 can land on water as well. \n\nIn parallel, UK-based [Hybrid Air Vehicles](https://www.hybridairvehicles.com/) has developed the Airlander 10, a similar airship that was [certified for flight](http://www.heavyliftpfi.com/news/airlander-cleared-for-take-off.html) in April 2016. The Airlander 10 can carry up to 22,000 pounds of cargo.\n\nIn March 2016, [Straightline Aviation](http://www.straightlineaviation.com/) placed an order for 12 LMH-1 airships, at a cost of $40 million each. (By comparison, Boeing's heavy-lift [Chinook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook) cargo helicopter costs $38.5 million.) Deliveries are expected in 2018. Although Straightline is still working to acquire customers in the oil, gas, and mining industries, the company is targeting Alaskan oilfields formerly accessible only by ice roads. Lockheed Martin expects to produce around 500 airships in the next ten years. Despite all these positive signs, however, bringing a major new type of aircraft into use is no small feat.\n\n***Will an oil, gas, or mining company employ hybrid airship transportation by the end of 2018?***\n\nTo resolve positively, a credible media story or corporate announcement must indicate that a company engaged in oil, gas, or mineral extraction has begun using an LMH-1, Airlander 10, or other hybrid airship for commercial operations on or before December 31, 2018.\n\n*(Edit 7/18/16: updated to include other potential airship manufacturers, especially Hybrid Air Vehicles.)*", "resolution": "no", "fine_print": ""}, {"title": "Major contentious CRISPR patent to be overturned?", "id": 284, "open_time": "2016-07-16T16:28:17Z", "actual_close_time": "2016-11-15T00:00:00Z", "status": "resolved", "type": "binary", "resolution_criteria": "In 2012, [CRISPR/Cas9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) burst onto the genetic scene with the limitless promise of gene editing, the ability to remove or replace genetic material in living cells. The landmark discovery has since become tangled in a bitter patent dispute, however, that could shape how the technology can be developed going forward.\n\nCRISPR stands for \"clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.\" First discovered [in bacteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC213968/) in 1987, CRISPR refers to a system used by cells to recognize and excise foreign DNA, such as from viruses. The CRISPR/Cas9 technology introduces a strand of RNA that guides the Cas9 enzyme to specific locations in the genome and precisely cuts DNA, like a pair of scissors. The target gene is either replaced with a new genetic sequence or is deleted entirely, and the change to the genetic sequence of that cell is permanent. CRISPR/Cas9 has already been used in [many](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3627607/) [organisms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3686313/) and, once fully developed, could point the way toward repairing faulty genes in human [genetic disorders.](http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-how-crispr-will-change-the-world/)\n\nFirst, however, CRISPR/Cas9 must endure a patent fight to decide which of the several scientists involved in the technology's discovery can claim the sole right to license CRISPR/Cas9 to laboratories and reap the profits of such exclusivity.\n\nThe key players: \n[Jennifer Doudna](http://rna.berkeley.edu/) of [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/). Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier published the [first CRISPR/Cas9 paper](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6096/816) in 2012, describing use of the technique in a bacterial cell - a prokaryotic cell without a nucleus. Doudna's patent [application](http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=32&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s2=Doudna.IN.&OS=IN/Doudna&RS=IN/Doudna) for the technique, filed first, is still pending.\n\n[Feng Zhang](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/principal-investigators/feng-zhang) of the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) in Cambridge, Mass. Independent of Doudna and Charpentier, Zhang published a [paper](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6121/819.long) in early 2013 that first showed use of CRISPR/Cas9 in a eukaryotic cell, or a cell with a nucleus. Zhang had his patent application expedited, however, and although he filed later than Doudna, his [patent](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=13&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=%22Zhang,+Feng%22.INNM.&s2=CRISPR.ABTX.&OS=IN/%22Zhang,+Feng%22+AND+ABST/CRISPR&RS=IN/%22Zhang,+Feng%22+AND+ABST/CRISPR) was awarded in 2014. Doudna's challenge to Zhang's patent triggered the current dispute, called an \"interference.\"\n\nA complicating wrinkle in the dispute is [a law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leahy-Smith_America_Invents_Act) that took effect on March 16, 2013 that changed patent priority from \"first to invent\" to \"first to file.\" The trouble in this case is that Zhang's filings may contain inventions made both before and after March 16, complicating interpretation of which rules apply to the patent.\n\nZhang's argument is that although Doudna's group showed an earlier use of the building blocks of CRISPR/Cas9, he first applied it in the actual target system, the eukaryotic cell. Doudna's argument is that her earlier use of the technology and filing of a patent establishes priority, and that Zhang's lab may have misrepresented when they developed key steps of the method. [Other parties](https://www.broadinstitute.org/what-broad/areas-focus/project-spotlight/crispr-timeline) are also claiming a share of the credit for discovering CRISPR.\n\nAt stake is the right to own the CRISPR/Cas9 enterprise, technology that would be licensed out to laboratories that want to engage in gene editing. Several groups, including Doudna and Zhang, have started gene editing companies that, together, have raised more than $1 billion in funding. The patent could be worth an untold amount of money, given the excitement and promise of CRISPR/Cas9. \n\nOpening motions in the case were filed in March. On November 17, 2016, a three-judge panel will hear oral arguments. A decision could take months, however, and any appeals could extend the process of rendering a final judgment.\n\n***Will a decision be issued in the CRISPR/Cas9 patent interference case by the end of 2017 that overturns Zhang's 2014 patent?***\n\nThis questions will resolve as positive if the [US Patent and Trademark Office](http://www.uspto.gov/) three-judge panel issues its decision regarding the rights to the CRISPR/Cas9 patent on or before December 31, 2017, and that decision overturns at least some claims of the Zhang 2014 patent.

This is the conceit behind, for example, [The Matrix](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/) movie series and the \"[brain in a vat](http://www.iep.utm.edu/brainvat/)\" set of philosophical explorations.\n\nA different mode, \"artificial consciousness, simulated reality\" (ACSR) considers artificially intelligent and conscious computer programs that experience a fully fabricated reality \u2013 what might be true (under certain philosophical assumptions) if a non-playing character in a video game were sufficiently complex as to have an internal subjective experience. (This would also describe the \"Agents\" in The Matrix.)\n\nWhile this is (literally!) the stuff of science fiction, there are cogent arguments put forth in the literature, for example [by Bostrom](http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html), that we are *likely* to be in a simulated reality.  In a nutshell, if such simulations are possible, it is likely that somewhere in spacetime they will be performed, and arguably give rise to many, many more simulated beings than does the \"real world.\"  Thus if we assume just that we are subjectively self-aware beings, we are more likely to be one of the simulated ones than a \"real\" one.\n\nThis argument has recently been in the news when [Elon Musk asserted](http://arstechnica.co.uk/the-multiverse/2016/06/are-we-living-in-a-simulated-reality-elon-musk/) that \u201cThere\u2019s a one in billions chance [we\u2019re in] base reality...

The incident sparked a debate about the use of force in police encounters, as well as the lack of comprehensive reporting of such incidents.\n\nCurrently, the [Bureau of Justice Statistics](http://www.bjs.gov/) compiles [reports](http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=82) from state agencies of deaths that occurred while in police custody.

Further statistics paint a picture of the majority of encounters: Most of the victims were white males, armed with a deadly weapon in the process of an active attack. By race, 26% of those shot and killed were black and 17% were Hispanic. Mental illness played a factor in at least 25% of incidents.\n\nIn December 2015, the FBI [announced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/fbi-to-sharply-expand-system-for-tracking-fatal-police-shootings/2015/12/08/a60fbc16-9dd4-11e5-bce4-708fe33e3288_story.html) that their system for tracking deaths in police custody, including non-shooting incidents, would dramatically expand by 2017. \n\nMany solutions have been proposed to reduce police shootings, including [additional training](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2015/12/10/new-style-of-police-training-aims-to-produce-guardians-not-warriors/) on interacting with mentally ill individuals.

The [advisory panel] even encouraged the possibility of an earlier launch date, which would move the launch from the mid 2030s to 2029. \n\nThe following is a synopsis of the mission design - for more depth, see the [whitepaper]. Three satellites forming the vertices of an equilateral triangle (side length 1 million km!) will be launched into a heliocentric orbit, trailing the Earth by 20\u00b0. Like LIGO, eLISA is based on a Michelson interferometer design; two spacecrafts make up the endpoints of the interferometer arms and send and receive laser light to a source craft, which then measures the changing arm length through phase differences in the light. However, the core variable eLISA is measuring is the changing non-geodesic acceleration between a pair of test masses housed in free-fall in the source spacecraft. Combined with interferometric measurements on additional test masses housed in each arm, a signal and noise spectrum can be established on the contracting and expanding spacetime between the masses due to gravitational waves. eLISA can measure the frequency, phase, and polarity information of the incoming waves to identify high-magnitude gravitational events, such as inspiraling black hole binaries.\n\nFormerly [LISA], eLISA was intended to be a joint endeavor between NASA and ESA. In 2011, a lack of funding led to [NASA removing itself] from the efforts of the mission.

With the nearest stars parsecs away, reaching them in a human lifetime requires speeds of at least 10% the speed of light.  As can be seen from the [rocket equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation), chemical rockets with exhaust speeds of a few km/s would require exponentially large mass to attain relativistic speeds of ~100,000 km/s.  It's hopeless.\r\n\r\nUnless relativistic exhaust speeds can be obtained (difficult!), leaving the solar system will require *external* acceleration.  A variety of schemes along these lines have been proposed over the years.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the [\"starwisp\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starwisp) is a small nanowire mesh \"sail\" driven by the radiation pressure of reflected microwaves; the microwaves would be produced by a phased array of terrestrial or orbital dishes.  \r\n\r\nRecently, a detailed study of laser-driven sails [was posted](http://www.deepspace.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/A-Roadmap-to-Interstellar-Flight-15-h.pdf) proposing use of newly-developed ultra-high-reflectivity materials, and (now technically feasible) phased arrays of optical/IR lasers.  High reflectivity allows acceleration without incineration; phased arrays allow a highly collimated beam without a laser of enormous diameter.\r\n\r\nWhile technically plausible, such systems would require large-scale investment in both R&D and deployment on the scale of at least a major NASA mission or large-scale particle physics project.  \r\n\r\nThe possibility of this occurring just received a major boost with the announcement that entrepreneur and Philanthropist [Yuri Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Milner) has [committed $100 Million](http://breakthroughinitiatives.org) to a \"research and engineering program [that] will seek proof of concept for using light beam to propel gram-scale \u2018nanocraft\u2019 to 20% light speed.\" \r\n\r\nIn subsequent questions we will look at the probability of developing some of the necessary technologies to make a project like this a reality.

Small-molecule inhibitors of this channel, however, fail to completely shut off the pain response in humans. Mysteriously, a [non-functional mutant] of this protein homologue in mice has been shown to achieve painlessness. Since then, a number of drugs with marginal success have been developed by multinational healthcare companies, including [Roche] and [Biogen].\n\nA recent study has revealed [a novel function of Nav1.7] that may present a possible new target for drug therapies against chronic pain.  According to scientists from the lab of Dr. John Wood at University College London, deletion or deleterious mutation of the Nav1.7 gene in mice caused the expression of opiate-simulating proteins (\"opioids\") to be up-regulated--a contribution to their painlessness not observed in humans. A Nav1.7-lacking, pain-insensitive human subject, after being given opioid blockers, was able to feel pain for the first time.  A combined treatment with opioids in addition to Nav1.7 blockers in mice proved to have the expected opposite effect: a complete suppression of the pain response.\n\nThe newly-discovered treatment apparently works, but still [remains somewhat impractical]. While relatively small, biologics like opiods are fairly difficult (and therefore expensive) to produce, store, distribute, etc. Other options would be geneitc modification or, more commonly, a small-molecule substitute--specifically, one that will inhibit the opiod-regulating function of Nav1.7, either directly or indirectly.

A gene drive in a particular allele shows up as a bias for the corresponding phenotype in the offspring. Consider two parents with different alleles for the same gene; if there exists a gene drive for one allele, it is highly likely that all of the parents' offspring will carry the driven gene's trait. \n\nWith new advances in genetic engineering using CRISPR, it is now much easier to modify an organism's genes. This makes *engineered* gene drives [tractable]: a gene coding for the CRISPR system itself can be encoded near to the gene being \"driven,\" so that if one copy of the driven allele and one \"wild\" allele are inherited, the CRISPR system modifies the wild gene so that the driven gene plus CRISPR system is inherited.  This process can spread the driven gene expoentially throughout a population, at a rate far exceeding the spread of a gene that is merely favorable for survival.\n\nUses of this method include the potential to eliminate diseases like malaria or lyme disease that are spread by a fast-reproducing vector, by promoting disease-resistant traits.
